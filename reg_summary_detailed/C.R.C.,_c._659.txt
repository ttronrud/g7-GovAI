### **Regulation Title**  
*Canadian Turkey Anti-Dumping Regulations*  
These regulations are designed to prevent unfair pricing practices—specifically, dumping—of turkeys in Canadian markets by ensuring that turkeys imported from outside the regulated area are not sold at prices below their fair market value.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Marketing (Commercialisation)**  
   Marketing, in the context of turkeys, encompasses all activities related to the sale, offering for sale, purchase, pricing, assembly, packaging, processing, transportation, storage, and resale—whether whole or processed.  
   - This includes marketing *by or on behalf of a producer*.  
   - The term is broad and covers the full supply chain from production to final distribution.

2. **Regulated Area**  
   The provinces of:  
   - Nova Scotia  
   - New Brunswick  
   - Quebec  
   - Ontario  
   - Manitoba  
   - Saskatchewan  
   - Alberta  
   - British Columbia  
   These provinces are subject to the anti-dumping provisions of the regulations.  

3. **Turkey (Dindon)**  
   The term includes:  
   - Any live or slaughtered turkey, male or female  
   - Any size  
   - Any part of a turkey (e.g., meat, giblets, skin, etc.)  
   This ensures that even partial products or by-products are covered under the regulation.

4. **Unregulated Area**  
   Any part of Canada *outside* the regulated area.  
   - This includes territories such as Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and regions not listed in the regulated area.  
   - Turkeys originating here are subject to different rules when moving into the regulated area.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Prohibition of Dumping in Interprovincial Trade (From Unregulated Area to Regulated Area)**  
When turkeys are shipped **from the unregulated area into the regulated area** for **interprovincial trade** (i.e., not for export), the following rule applies:

> No person may market turkeys in a province **other than the province where they were produced** at a price that is **less than**:
> - The price charged at or about the same time for turkeys of an **equivalent variety, class, or grade** in the province or other geographical area where they were produced; **plus**
> - Any **reasonable transportation charges** incurred by the marketer to deliver the turkeys to the place of marketing.

🔹 **Purpose**: Prevents producers in unregulated areas from selling turkeys in regulated provinces at below-market prices, which could harm domestic producers in the regulated provinces through unfair competition.

🔹 **Key Elements**:
- Price comparison must be based on **equivalent variety, class, or grade** (e.g., a whole, fresh, organic turkey vs. another whole, fresh, organic turkey).
- Transportation costs must be reasonable and directly attributable to the movement of the product.
- The rule applies only to **interprovincial trade**, not to exports.

#### **2. Prohibition of Dumping in Interprovincial Trade (From Regulated Area to Unregulated Area)**  
When turkeys are shipped **from the regulated area into the unregulated area** for interprovincial trade:

> No person may market turkeys in a province **other than the province where they were produced** at a price that is **less than**:
> - The price charged at or about the same time for turkeys of an **equivalent variety, class, or grade** in the province or other geographical area where they were produced; **plus**
> - Any **reasonable transportation charges** incurred by the marketer to deliver the turkeys to the place of marketing.

🔹 **Purpose**: Ensures that turkeys produced within Canada are not sold in unregulated areas at unfairly low prices, which could undercut domestic producers in the regulated provinces.

🔹 **Key Elements**:
- Applies to both domestic and interprovincial movements.
- Maintains price fairness across provincial borders.
- Prevents "dumping" even when the product moves from one Canadian province to another.

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

- **Anti-Dumping Objective**: To protect Canadian turkey producers from unfair competition due to the sale of turkeys at prices below their fair value.
- **Fair Market Price Benchmark**: The rule uses a benchmark based on the **local market price** in the province of origin, adjusted for reasonable transportation costs.
- **Geographic Fairness**: The regulation ensures that prices reflect the local market conditions of the place of origin, not external or foreign pricing influences.
- **Interprovincial Trade Focus**: The rules apply to trade *within* Canada, not to international exports or imports from outside Canada (which would fall under different trade regulations).

---

### **Scope and Application**

- Applies to **all turkeys**, including live and slaughtered, and all parts of turkeys.
- Applies to **all marketing activities** (buying, selling, transporting, processing).
- Applies to **all provinces** within the regulated area and to interprovincial movements involving the unregulated area.
- Applies to **both producers and third-party marketers** (e.g., distributors, retailers).

---

### **Enforcement and Penalties**

While not explicitly detailed in the provided text, such regulations are typically enforced by the **Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)** or the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**, with penalties including:
- Fines
- Injunctions against illegal pricing
- Orders to cease and desist marketing at below-market prices

Violations may result in financial penalties and reputational harm to the offending entity.

---

### **Why These Regulations Exist**

- To maintain a **level playing field** for Canadian turkey producers.
- To prevent **unfair competition** from turkeys sold at artificially low prices from outside the regulated area.
- To protect **domestic agriculture and food supply chains** from market distortions caused by dumping.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Canadian Turkey Anti-Dumping Regulations* establish a fair pricing mechanism for turkeys moving between Canadian provinces. By requiring that turkeys be marketed at a price no lower than the price charged in their place of origin (plus reasonable transportation costs), the regulations prevent dumping and protect domestic producers from being undercut by unfairly priced imports from outside the regulated area or from within Canada when moving across provincial borders.

These rules are essential for preserving market integrity, supporting local agriculture, and ensuring that Canadian producers can compete on fair terms in the domestic market.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
The Canadian Turkey Anti-Dumping Regulations prohibit the marketing of turkeys in Canada (both within and between provinces) at prices below those charged in their place of origin, plus reasonable transportation costs, to prevent dumping and protect domestic producers from unfair competition.
