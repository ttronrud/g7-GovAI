### 🎯 **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of these regulations was to **promote transparency** in the pharmaceutical industry by requiring **patent holders** and **licensees** to disclose specific information about:

1. **Patented medicines** (including details of patents, expiry dates, and supplementary protection certificates),
2. **Sales pricing and revenue** (including average prices, net revenue, and ex-factory prices),
3. **Research and development (R&D) expenditures**.

This transparency aimed to:
- Support **public access to drug pricing and innovation data**,
- Enable **informed policy decisions** regarding access to medicines,
- Encourage **innovation and fair competition** in the pharmaceutical market,
- Ensure that **public health and patient access** are not compromised by monopolistic pricing.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Although the regulation was intended to serve public interest, it was ultimately **repealed in 2008**, indicating that its implementation was either deemed ineffective, outdated, or superseded by newer regulatory frameworks (such as the *Pharmaceutical Pricing and Access Act* or updated provisions under the *Patent Act* and *Food and Drug Regulations*).
