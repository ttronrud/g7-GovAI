*Issued by the Minister of Employment and Social Development, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, on May 14, 2020*

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Emergency Student Benefit Regulations* (CESB Regulations) were introduced under the *Canada Emergency Student Benefit Act* (CESBA) to provide financial support to students affected by the economic disruptions caused by the global pandemic in 2020. These regulations establish the eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, duration, and key definitions for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB), a weekly payment designed to help students cover living expenses during periods of financial hardship.

The regulations came into force on **May 10, 2020**, and were developed in response to the urgent need to support post-secondary students during a time when many faced job losses, program disruptions, and increased financial pressures.

## **Key Provisions and Explanations**

---

### **1. Definitions and Key Terms**

#### **Act**
- "Act" refers to the *Canada Emergency Student Benefit Act* (CESBA), which provides the legal framework for the CESB.

#### **Dependant**
A "dependant" is defined as:
- A child (including adopted, stepchild, or foster child) under **12 years of age** who is **wholly dependent** on the student or the student’s spouse/common-law partner for care and upbringing; **or**
- A person with a disability who is **wholly dependent** on the student or their spouse/common-law partner for care and upbringing.

> This definition ensures that students with children or individuals with disabilities who rely on them for daily support are eligible for enhanced benefits.

#### **Disability**
- "Disability" includes any **impairment** (physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication, or sensory), whether permanent or episodic, and whether evident or not.
- It must interact with a **barrier** (as defined in Section 2 of the *Accessible Canada Act*) to hinder a person’s full and equal participation in society.

> This broad definition aligns with Canada’s accessibility and inclusion goals and ensures that students supporting persons with disabilities receive appropriate support.

### **2. Who Is Considered a "Student"?**

Under the definition in Section 2 of the Act, a "student" includes someone enrolled in a post-secondary educational program that meets one of the following criteria:

#### **Eligible Institutions:**
- An educational institution listed in the **Master List of Designated Educational Institutions** (published by the Government of Canada).
- An educational institution listed in the **Master List of Certified Educational Institutions** (published by the Government of Canada).
- An educational institution listed in the **Directory of Educational Institutions and Programs** (published by the Government of Quebec).
- An **Indigenous institution recognized by a province**.

#### **Prescribed Students (Special Provision)**
- A student who is **expected to graduate from secondary school in 2020**, has **applied for enrollment** in a post-secondary program (leading to a degree, diploma, or certificate), and plans to enroll **if accepted**, **provided the program begins before February 1, 2021**.

> This provision ensures that students who were in the final stages of secondary school and were transitioning into post-secondary education are not excluded from the benefit, even if they had not yet officially enrolled.

---

### **3. Prescribed Period for Benefit Eligibility**

The CESB is available during specific timeframes based on the student’s graduation date. The prescribed period is:

| Student Type | Prescribed Period |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Student described in (a)** (e.g., enrolled in a program before May 10, 2020) | **May 10, 2020 – August 29, 2020** |
| **Student described in (b) or (c)** (graduates before May 10, 2020) | **May 10, 2020 – August 29, 2020** |
| **Student described in (b) or (c)** (graduates on or after May 10, 2020 but before June 7, 2020) | **June 7, 2020 – August 29, 2020** |
| **Student described in (b) or (c)** (has not graduated before June 7, 2020) | **July 5, 2020 – August 29, 2020** |

> This staggered timeline reflects the government’s effort to provide support to students based on their enrollment and graduation timelines, allowing for flexibility in the transition from secondary to post-secondary education.

---

### **4. Income Threshold Exclusion (Paragraph 6(1)(b)(i))**

- Any income earned by a student from **employment or self-employment** during the **four-week period** for which they apply is **excluded** from the income assessment **if it does not exceed $1,000**.
- The threshold is **$1,000.01** — meaning **$1,000 or less** is considered exempt.

> This provision protects students who may have earned small amounts of income (e.g., part-time work or gig economy activities) from being disqualified due to low income, ensuring that financial hardship is not unfairly penalized.

---

### **5. Benefit Amounts (Subsection 7(1))**

The weekly CESB amount depends on the student’s circumstances:

| Situation | Weekly Benefit Amount |
|---------|------------------------|
| Student with a **dependant** OR a **person with a disability** | **$500** |
| All other students | **$312.50** |

> The higher rate ($500) is intended to support students who have additional caregiving responsibilities, recognizing the increased financial burden associated with caring for dependants or persons with disabilities.

---

### **6. Maximum Duration of Benefit (Subsection 8(1))**

- The **maximum number of weeks** a student can receive the CESB is **16 weeks**.
- However, this is **reduced** if the student receives:
  - An **Income Support Payment** under the *Canada Emergency Response Benefit Act* (CERB), or
  - An **Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit** (as defined in Section 153.7 of the Employment Insurance Act).

> This rule prevents overlap between CESB and other federal emergency benefits, ensuring that individuals do not receive duplicate or overlapping financial support.

---

### **7. Regulatory Enforcement and Effectiveness**

- The regulations are **deemed to have come into force on May 10, 2020**, the same day the prescribed benefit period begins for most students.
- The rules are administered by the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**, with **approval from the Minister of Finance**, as required by specific provisions in the CESBA.

---

## **Purpose and Context**

The CESB was introduced in response to the **economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic**, particularly affecting students who:
- Lost access to part-time jobs or income,
- Were unable to attend in-person classes or complete programs,
- Faced increased costs for housing, food, and supplies,
- Had dependants or persons with disabilities requiring care.

The regulations were designed to:
- Provide **immediate, targeted financial relief**,
- Support **equitable access** to post-secondary education,
- Recognize the **unique challenges** faced by students with dependants or disabilities,
- Avoid duplication with other emergency benefits.
