**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Atlantic Whitefish (Coregonus huntsmani) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation, known as the *Critical Habitat of the Atlantic Whitefish (Coregonus huntsmani) Order*, is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is the primary Canadian federal legislation designed to protect and recover wildlife species at risk. The Act was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) and is further amended by subsequent legislation, including the 2015 amendment (S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60).

The Atlantic Whitefish (*Coregonus huntsmani*) is a native freshwater fish species found primarily in the northeastern regions of Canada, particularly in the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries. It has been officially listed as an **endangered species** under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA, meaning it faces a high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

**2. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**

A formal recovery strategy for the Atlantic Whitefish was developed to guide its conservation and recovery. This strategy includes a detailed identification of the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species. The critical habitat is defined as the habitat that is necessary for the species’ survival and recovery, and it must be protected from harmful human activities.

This recovery strategy has been formally **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada that provides transparency and accountability regarding species at risk and the measures taken to protect them.

**3. Legal Basis for the Order**

The Order is issued under **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*. These provisions empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate and regulate critical habitat for species listed as endangered. Specifically:

- **Section 58(4)** allows the Minister to designate critical habitat based on the recovery strategy.
- **Section 58(5)** provides that the Minister may issue an Order to define and specify the critical habitat, which must be consistent with the recovery strategy and the species’ needs.

Importantly, **subsection 58(1)** of the Act applies to the critical habitat of the Atlantic Whitefish, meaning that the designated areas are legally recognized as essential for the species’ survival and recovery.

**4. Key Legal Condition: Exclusion from Prohibited Areas**

A significant condition in this Order is that **no portion of the designated critical habitat falls within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b of the Species at Risk Act**. This subsection prohibits the Minister from designating critical habitat in areas that are:

- Located within a place that is **not subject to the Act’s protections**, or  
- Where the designation would **conflict with other federal or provincial laws or policies** (such as land-use planning, Indigenous rights, or other environmental regulations).

By confirming that the critical habitat identified in this Order **does not fall within any such excluded area**, the government ensures that the designation is legally valid and enforceable under SARA.

---

**5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- **Formally designate specific geographic areas** as critical habitat for the Atlantic Whitefish.
- **Ensure legal protection** of these areas from activities that could degrade or destroy the habitat (such as dam construction, mining, pollution, or unregulated development).
- **Support the recovery of the species** by safeguarding the environmental conditions necessary for its survival and reproduction.

The Order provides a clear, legally binding description of where the Atlantic Whitefish depends on natural conditions—such as clean, cold, well-oxygenated streams and specific water temperatures and flow regimes—to survive and reproduce.

---

**6. Implementation and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, which is the official publication of federal laws and regulations.
- Once registered, the critical habitat designation becomes enforceable under SARA. Any federal or provincial activity that may affect the designated habitat must comply with the requirements of the Act, including:
  - Environmental assessments.
  - Mitigation measures.
  - Permitting processes to prevent harm.
- The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for monitoring, enforcement, and coordination with provincial and Indigenous partners to ensure compliance.

**7. Significance of the Order**

This Order is a critical step in the recovery of the Atlantic Whitefish, which has declined significantly due to habitat degradation, climate change, and hydroelectric development. By formally protecting its critical habitat, the government:

- Reinforces commitment to biodiversity conservation.
- Demonstrates alignment with international obligations (e.g., the Convention on Biological Diversity).
- Supports ecosystem-based management and sustainable freshwater resource use.

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Atlantic Whitefish (Coregonus huntsmani) Order*, issued on **September 4, 2018**, legally designates and protects the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of this endangered species. It is grounded in the recovery strategy, validated by legal compliance checks, and enforceable under the *Species at Risk Act*. This step is a vital component of Canada’s broader strategy to prevent extinction and promote the long-term viability of at-risk species in the wild.
