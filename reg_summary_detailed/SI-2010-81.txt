**Detailed Summary of the Statistics Canada Census and Survey Related Term Employment Exclusion Approval Order (SI/2010-45)**

---

### **1. Overview of the Regulation**

The *Statistics Canada Census and Survey Related Term Employment Exclusion Approval Order* (SI/2010-45), issued on **September 29, 2010**, is a regulatory instrument under the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA). It establishes specific exemptions from certain provisions of the PSEA for employees in **Statistics Canada** who are engaged in **census-related administrative, management support, or data processing duties**.

This Order was developed in response to the unique operational needs of Statistics Canada during the conduct of major censuses — particularly the **Population Census**, **Agriculture Census**, and the **National Household Survey (NHS)** — which replaced the long-form population census questionnaire in 2011.

The Order provides a **temporary and targeted exclusion** from key employment rules, allowing Statistics Canada greater flexibility in staffing and managing temporary roles essential to census operations.

---

### **2. Legal Basis**

- The Order is made under **section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**.
- It is based on a decision by the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** that it is **neither practicable nor in the public interest** to apply certain provisions of the PSEA to specific temporary positions in Statistics Canada.
- The PSC conducted consultations with the employer (Statistics Canada) before making this decision, as required under **subsection 20(2)** of the PSEA.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **A. Reapplication of the Public Service Employment Act to Excluded Positions**

The Order **reapplies** the full scope of the PSEA to positions that were previously excluded under the *Statistics Canada Census-Related Term Employment Exclusion Approval Order* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 12 and 13). This means that:

- The **original exclusion** from PSEA provisions was **reversed** for these positions.
- The positions in question — those previously excluded — are now subject to all applicable rules of the PSEA, including those related to:
  - Recruitment and appointment
  - Employment conditions
  - Promotion and mobility
  - Termination
  - Internal mobility and transfer processes

> **Note**: This reapplication ensures that the positions are not entirely outside the public service employment framework, but instead are brought back under the standard rules governing public service employment.

---

#### **B. Exclusion from Specific Provisions of the PSEA**

For certain **temporary positions** in Statistics Canada involved in census or survey work, the Order **excludes** the following provisions of the PSEA:

##### **Excluded Definitions and Sections**:

| Element | Excluded From |
|--------|----------------|
| **Definitions** | The terms "**deployment**" and "**internal appointment process**" in **subsection 2(1)** of the PSEA |
| **Paragraphs 22(2)(a) to (c)** | These define conditions under which internal appointments or promotions may occur; they are excluded |
| **Sections** | 40, 41(d), 48, 51 to 53(e), 57, 59, and 62 of the PSEA |

##### **Scope of Exclusion**:

The exclusion applies to:

- Positions in **Statistics Canada** whose **primary function** is:
  - To provide **administrative or management support**, or
  - To perform **data processing duties**
- For the purpose of:
  - Conducting the **Population Census**
  - Conducting the **Agriculture Census**
  - Conducting the **National Household Survey (NHS)** — which replaced the long-form population census questionnaire and was conducted in conjunction with the population census

> These duties are limited to **support functions** directly tied to census operations, not core research or analytical roles.

##### **Applicable Personnel**:

- Individuals **appointed or deployed** to these positions on a **specified term basis** (i.e., temporary, short-term contracts)
- The exclusion applies **only to such temporary employees**
- **Exclusions do not extend to other persons** mentioned in **subsection 5(1) of the Statistics Act**

> This ensures that key public service roles (e.g., senior analysts, field supervisors, or data scientists) remain subject to standard public service employment rules.

---

### **4. Purpose and Rationale**

The rationale behind this Order is grounded in **practicality and operational necessity**:

- Census operations require **large-scale, temporary staffing** to handle data collection, processing, and administrative support.
- Applying full PSEA rules (such as internal appointment processes, deployment requirements, and strict promotion pathways) to these temporary roles would:
  - Delay or hinder census operations
  - Increase administrative burden
  - Impede the ability to hire skilled personnel quickly and efficiently
- The Public Service Commission determined that **excluding these specific provisions** is both **practicable** and **in the public interest**, given the urgency and scale of census activities.

However, the Order also recognizes that **core public service employment principles** must still be upheld — hence the **reapplication of the Act** to the excluded positions, ensuring that temporary staff are not entirely outside the public service framework.

---

### **5. Key Exceptions**

The exclusion **does not apply** to:

- Personnel mentioned in **subsection 5(1) of the Statistics Act** — these are typically individuals in **non-temporary, permanent roles** or those performing **core analytical or research functions**.
- Any position not directly involved in administrative or data processing for census or survey purposes.

This ensures that **critical, permanent roles** in Statistics Canada remain protected under standard public service employment rules.

---

### **6. Duration and Effectiveness**

- The Order is **temporary**, designed specifically for the duration of census and survey operations.
- It applies to:
  - The **Population Census**
  - The **Agriculture Census**
  - The **National Household Survey (NHS)**, when conducted in conjunction with the population census
- The exclusion remains in force **until the census or survey activities are completed**, and the temporary appointments end.

> The Order does not extend beyond the operational life of these specific surveys.

---

### **7. Citation and Official Status**

- The Order may be cited as:  
  **Statistics Canada Census and Survey Related Term Employment Exclusion Approval Order**  
  (SI/2010-45)

- It is published in the **Supplement to the Canada Gazette** and is legally binding under the authority of the Public Service Employment Act.

---

### **8. Contextual Background**

- The original exclusion was introduced in **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 12 and 13**, to allow flexibility during census operations.
- In **2006**, further amendments (S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 100, 103, 104) and references to **R.S., c. S-19** (the *Public Service Employment Act*) reinforced the framework for temporary staffing in census-related roles.
- This 2010 Order **reaffirms and updates** the exclusion, with a clear legal basis and consultation process, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### **9. Implications for Public Service Employment**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Flexibility for Statistics Canada** | Enables rapid hiring and deployment of temporary staff for census operations |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Reduces delays in data collection and processing |
| **Compliance with Public Service Standards** | Temporary staff are still governed by employment laws, but with tailored exemptions |
| **Accountability** | The Public Service Commission’s consultation ensures that exclusions are justified and transparent |
| **Public Interest** | Supports accurate and timely census data collection, which is vital for policy development and resource allocation |

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Statistics Canada Census and Survey Related Term Employment Exclusion Approval Order* (SI/2010-45) is a **targeted, temporary, and legally sound exemption** that allows Statistics Canada to manage the logistical demands of major censuses and surveys without violating broader public service employment principles.

By **excluding specific definitions and provisions** from the PSEA for temporary administrative and data processing roles, the Order enables efficient, timely, and cost-effective operations. At the same time, it maintains the integrity of public service employment standards by **reapplying the Act to excluded positions** and ensuring that only those directly involved in census-related support are exempted.

This balance between operational flexibility and public service accountability reflects the adaptability of Canada’s public service framework in responding to national statistical needs.

**Final Note**: This Order is not a general waiver of public service employment rules. It is a **narrow, context-specific exception** applicable only to temporary, census-related support roles in Statistics Canada.
