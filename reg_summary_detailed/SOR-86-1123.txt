**Detailed Summary of the Treasury Board Delegation of Powers Order**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Treasury Board Delegation of Powers Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Made under subsection 5(3) of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), on the recommendation of the Treasury Board.  
**Citation:** S.C. 1984, c. 31, s. 4  

---

### **Purpose of the Order**
This regulatory instrument authorizes the **Treasury Board** (TB) to exercise certain powers that are normally reserved for the **Governor in Council** (the federal government’s executive authority, typically exercised by the Governor General on the advice of the Cabinet) under **paragraph 34(1)(a) of the Financial Administration Act**.

The core objective is to **enhance administrative efficiency and financial control** by enabling the Treasury Board to act as a gatekeeper for certain financial commitments—specifically, those involving payments that exceed prescribed thresholds—thereby preventing unauthorized or unapproved expenditures.

---

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Delegation of Powers**
The Order formally delegates to the **Treasury Board** the authority previously held by the **Governor in Council** under **paragraph 34(1)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This paragraph grants the Governor in Council the power to:

> “Direct that no contract by the terms of which payments are required in excess of such amount or amounts as the Treasury Board may prescribe shall be entered into or have any force or effect unless entry into the contract has been approved by the Treasury Board.”

This delegation allows the Treasury Board to **set and enforce financial thresholds** for contract approvals.

#### 2. **Contract Approval Thresholds**
- The Treasury Board may **prescribe specific monetary amounts or limits** (e.g., a contract exceeding $500,000 or $1 million) that trigger a requirement for **prior approval**.
- Any contract that includes **payments exceeding the prescribed amount** must:
  - Be **submitted for review and approval** by the Treasury Board **before execution**.
  - **Not be entered into or become effective** unless such approval is obtained.

#### 3. **Effect of the Requirement**
- A contract that fails to meet this approval requirement is **invalid or unenforceable**.
- This ensures that **large or financially significant commitments** are subject to rigorous oversight and are aligned with the government’s fiscal policies and budgetary priorities.

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The Order is made under **subsection 5(3) of the Financial Administration Act**, which permits the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Treasury Board) to issue regulations that delegate powers to the Treasury Board.
- The delegation is specifically tied to **paragraph 34(1)(a)** of the FAA, which deals with the control of government expenditures through contract oversight.

This reflects a **principle of delegated governance**—allowing specialized administrative bodies (like the Treasury Board) to manage day-to-day financial decisions while maintaining accountability and fiscal discipline.

---

### **Scope and Application**

- Applies to **all federal government departments and agencies**.
- Covers **all contracts** involving **payment obligations**, regardless of the nature of the goods or services (e.g., construction, consulting, equipment supply, etc.).
- Applies to **both new contracts** and **existing contracts** that may require future payments above the threshold.

### **Key Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fiscal Discipline** | Prevents unauthorized or unreviewed large expenditures. |
| **Accountability** | Ensures that major financial commitments are subject to formal review. |
| **Administrative Efficiency** | Streamlines decision-making by removing the need for Cabinet-level approval for routine contracts under defined limits. |

| **Flexibility** | Allows the Treasury Board to adjust thresholds as needed based on economic conditions or policy priorities. |

### **Limitations and Conditions**

- The Treasury Board **cannot delegate** the power to set thresholds to lower-level departments or officials.
- The thresholds must be **clearly defined and publicly accessible** (where appropriate), especially in cases involving public interest or procurement.
- The Treasury Board must **justify** any changes to thresholds in accordance with established financial and policy frameworks.
- The Order does **not apply to contracts that are exempt** under other provisions of the Financial Administration Act or other legislation.

### **Citation and Enforcement**

- The Order may be cited as: **Treasury Board Delegation of Powers Order**.
- It is enforceable as part of the *Financial Administration Act* and is binding on all federal departments and agencies.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a foundational tool in federal financial governance. By delegating the power to approve contracts involving significant payment obligations to the Treasury Board, it ensures that:

- Government spending remains **fiscally responsible**,
- Major financial commitments are **transparent and accountable**, and
- Administrative processes are **practical and efficient**.

It represents a balance between **centralized fiscal control** and **decentralized operational management**, allowing the Treasury Board to act as a critical financial gatekeeper without requiring constant intervention from the Cabinet or Governor in Council.
