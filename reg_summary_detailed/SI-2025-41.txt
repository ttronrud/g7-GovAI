### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Powers under the Official Languages Act**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It operates under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (commonly referred to as the "Public Service Rearrangement Act").
- This provision empowers the federal government to reassign powers, duties, and functions among different ministers in the Department of Public Service and Procurement, or within the federal government, to improve administrative efficiency or align with policy priorities.

---

#### **2. Subject Matter of the Transfer**
- The regulation transfers **powers, duties, and functions** related to the **Official Languages Act** (OLA).
- These responsibilities were previously held by the **Minister of State (Official Languages)**.
- The transfer is not a creation of new powers but a **reassignment** of existing statutory responsibilities.

#### **3. Historical Context of the Transfer**
- Prior to this regulation, the responsibilities under the Official Languages Act were assigned to the **Minister of State (Official Languages)** via **Order in Council P.C. 2021-946**, dated **October 26, 2021**.

  - Ensuring bilingualism in government services,
  - Oversight of language rights and access,
  - Enforcement of language provisions in federal institutions,
  - Monitoring compliance with the Official Languages Act.

- The current regulation **reassigns** these responsibilities from the Minister of State (Official Languages) to the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**.

#### **4. Purpose and Rationale**

  - Indigenous languages and heritage,

- This move enhances **interdepartmental coherence** and allows for more integrated policy development in areas where language and cultural identity intersect.
