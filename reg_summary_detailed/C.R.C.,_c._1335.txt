**Key Provision Summary:**

1. **Scope and Applicability of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA):**  
   Despite a specific exemption in paragraph 53(a) of the *National Defence Act*, which typically may restrict the application of certain public service employment laws to certain defence entities, this regulation explicitly **overrides that exemption** in the context of the Defence Research Board (DRB).

2. **Applicability to Specific Employee Categories:**  
   All provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) apply to the following categories of employees of the Defence Research Board:
   - Professional employees  
   - Scientific employees  
   - Technical employees  
   - Clerical employees  
   - Other employees required to carry out the duties of the DRB efficiently  

   This ensures that these employees are subject to the same employment standards, rights, responsibilities, and protections as other public servants under the PSEA.

3. **Purpose and Rationale:**  
   The regulation is designed to ensure that the Defence Research Board operates with the same level of employment fairness, transparency, and accountability as other federal public service institutions. By mandating the application of the PSEA, it promotes consistency in employment practices, supports merit-based hiring and promotion, and ensures that employees are treated in accordance with established public service principles—such as fair treatment, job security, and procedural fairness.

4. **Implication of Overriding Paragraph 53(a):**  
   Paragraph 53(a) of the *National Defence Act* generally may have been intended to limit the application of public service employment laws to certain defence-related positions or entities. However, this regulation **specifically excludes that limitation** for the Defence Research Board, thereby affirming that DRB employees are fully covered under the PSEA, regardless of the general intent of the National Defence Act.

5. **Operational Impact:**  
   - Employees at the DRB benefit from rights such as fair recruitment, grievance procedures, leave entitlements, protection against unfair dismissal, and eligibility for pension and benefits under the PSEA.  
   - Management of DRB employees must adhere to PSEA standards in hiring, promotion, disciplinary actions, and termination.  
   - The regulation ensures that the DRB, as a research and development body within the Department of National Defence, maintains public service integrity and accountability.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Defence Research Board Employees Regulations* establish that despite potential exclusions in the *National Defence Act*, all employees of the Defence Research Board—particularly those in professional, scientific, technical, and clerical roles—are fully governed by the *Public Service Employment Act*. This ensures that DRB employees enjoy the same employment protections and rights as other federal public servants, reinforcing equity, transparency, and merit-based practices within the defence research sector.
