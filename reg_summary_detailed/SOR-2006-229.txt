**Detailed Summary of the Interest Rates (Excise Act, 2001) Regulations**  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 2002, c. 22*  
*Made under Section 304 of the Excise Act, 2001 (as amended)*  
*Effective Date: July 1, 2003*

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
These regulations establish the prescribed interest rates under the *Excise Act, 2001* for two distinct types of financial obligations:
- Interest payable to the **Receiver General of Canada** (e.g., on excise liabilities or receivables).
- Interest payable or applied by the **Minister of Finance** to individuals or entities (e.g., on amounts owed to taxpayers or other recipients).

The rates are determined quarterly and are based on a combination of the average yield of Government of Canada Treasury Bills and a fixed base rate.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Excise Act, 2001*, which governs excise taxes, duties, and related financial obligations.
- **Quarter**: A period of three consecutive months beginning on one of the following dates:
  - January 1
  - April 1
  - July 1
  - October 1  
  These define the quarterly cycles used to determine interest rates.

### **3. Interest Rate for Payments to the Receiver General**

For provisions in the Excise Act that require interest to be paid to the **Receiver General**, the prescribed rate during any given quarter is calculated as follows:

> **Total prescribed rate = (Average yield of Treasury Bills) + 4%**

#### a. Calculation of the Average Yield:
- Consider **all Government of Canada Treasury Bills** that:
  - Mature approximately **three months after their issue date** (i.e., 3-month bills).
  - Are sold through **auctions** during the **first month of the quarter immediately preceding** the current quarter.
- For each such bill, calculate its **average equivalent yield**, expressed as a **percentage per year**.
- Compute the **simple arithmetic mean** of all these yields.
- Express the mean as a **percentage per year**.
- **Round up** to the **next higher whole percentage** if the mean is not a whole number.

> Example: If the average yield of 3-month Treasury Bills auctioned in March 2023 is 2.75%, the mean is rounded up to **3%**.

#### b. Add 4%:
- Add **4%** to the rounded mean yield to arrive at the final prescribed interest rate for that quarter.

> Final rate = (Rounded mean yield) + 4%

#### Example:
- Mean yield from March 2023 auctions: 2.75% → rounded up to 3%
- Final rate = 3% + 4% = **7%**

This rate applies to interest due to the Receiver General under excise-related financial obligations.

### **4. Interest Rate for Payments to Individuals or Entities (e.g., Taxpayers)**

For provisions in the Excise Act requiring interest to be paid or applied on an amount owed by the Minister to a person (such as a taxpayer), the prescribed rate during any given quarter is:

> **Total prescribed rate = (Rate from paragraph 3(a)) + (additional rate based on the type of recipient)**

#### a. Base Rate from Paragraph (3)(a):
- The same rate as defined above: the mean yield of 3-month Treasury Bills (rounded up) + 4%.

#### b. Additional Rate Based on Recipient Type:
- **If the recipient is a corporation**:  
  → **0% additional rate**  
  → Total rate = (Mean yield + 4%) + 0% = (Mean yield + 4%)

- **If the recipient is not a corporation** (e.g., individual, non-profit, etc.):  
  → **2% additional rate**  
  → Total rate = (Mean yield + 4%) + 2% = (Mean yield + 6%)

> This means individuals or non-corporate entities receive a higher interest rate than corporations when the Minister owes them money.

#### Example:
- Mean yield: 3%
- Base rate: 3% + 4% = 7%
- Corporation recipient: 7% total
- Individual/non-corporate recipient: 7% + 2% = **9% total**

### **5. Effective Date**

These regulations are **deemed to have come into force on July 1, 2003**.  
This means that all interest calculations based on these rules began on that date, and any interest due or payable from that point onward must be calculated using the specified methodology.

---

### **6. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Market-Based Component** | The interest rate is tied to real market conditions via Treasury Bill yields, ensuring it reflects current economic conditions. |
| **Stability via Fixed Base** | The addition of 4% (or 6% for individuals) provides a floor rate, ensuring a minimum level of interest, even in low-yield environments. |
| **Differentiation by Recipient Type** | Corporations receive lower interest (0%) compared to individuals or other entities (2%), which may reflect policy considerations on tax compliance or administrative costs. |
| **Quarterly Adjustment** | Rates are reviewed and updated every three months (on Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct), allowing for timely responsiveness to economic shifts. |
| **Rounding Rule** | The arithmetic mean is **always rounded up** to the next whole percentage, which ensures that interest rates do not fall below the rounded-up value. This prevents rate erosion due to fractional yields. |

### **7. Legal Basis**

These regulations were made:
- By **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- Under **Section 304 of the Excise Act, 2001**, which authorizes the setting of interest rates for excise-related financial obligations.

---

### **8. Practical Application**

- **For tax authorities or the Receiver General**: When a taxpayer owes excise duty, interest is calculated at the quarterly rate derived from Treasury Bill yields plus 4%.
- **For taxpayers (especially individuals)**: If the Minister owes a taxpayer (e.g., for a refund or overpayment), interest is charged at the mean yield plus 6%.
- **For corporations**: Interest is lower (mean yield + 4%) due to the 0% addition, potentially reflecting a policy to reduce the burden on corporate entities.

### **Conclusion**

The *Interest Rates (Excise Act, 2001) Regulations* provide a transparent, market-responsive, and equitable framework for determining interest rates under the Excise Act. By linking the rate to Treasury Bill yields and introducing a tiered structure based on recipient type, the regulations balance economic realism with fairness in financial obligations between individuals and corporations. The quarterly update mechanism ensures that rates remain aligned with current financial conditions, while the rounding-up rule and fixed base rates provide stability and predictability in interest calculations.

These regulations are a critical component of Canada’s excise tax administration, ensuring that interest is both fair and reflective of the broader financial environment.
