**Summary:**

This regulation formally transfers administrative control and supervision of a specific component of the federal public administration — the **Borders Task Force** — from the **Privy Council Office (PCO)** to the **Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (DPSEP)**.

**Key Details:**

1. **Subject of Transfer:**  
   The portion of the federal public administration within the Privy Council Office known as the **Borders Task Force** is being transferred. This task force is responsible for coordinating and managing activities related to border security, immigration enforcement, and cross-border operations in Canada.

2. **Transfer of Authority:**  
   The regulation specifies that the **control and supervision** of the Borders Task Force is being transferred. This includes the authority to direct operations, manage personnel, allocate resources, and oversee policy implementation related to the task force’s functions.

3. **Transfer From:**  
   The **Privy Council Office (PCO)** — a key department responsible for supporting the Prime Minister and the federal government’s executive functions. Historically, the PCO has housed various policy and coordination units, including those related to national security and border-related matters.

4. **Transfer To:**  
   The **Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (DPSEP)** — a department established to lead and coordinate federal efforts in public safety, emergency management, and security, including border security, law enforcement, and crisis response.

5. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision enables the federal government to reorganize public service structures and transfer duties between departments to improve efficiency, accountability, and alignment with policy priorities.

6. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer takes effect on **June 1, 2006**. From this date, the DPSEP assumes all responsibilities, oversight, and operational management of the Borders Task Force.

7. **Purpose and Rationale (Implied):**  
   The transfer reflects a strategic realignment of federal responsibilities to better align with the mandate of public safety and security. By moving border-related functions into the DPSEP, the government aims to:
   - Strengthen coordination between border enforcement and broader public safety initiatives.
   - Improve interdepartmental collaboration in managing immigration, security, and emergency response.
   - Enhance accountability and operational focus within a department specifically dedicated to public safety.

**Significance:**  
This regulation marks a key step in the federal government’s effort to centralize and streamline border and security operations. It reflects a shift from a policy-support role (under the PCO) to a functional, operational security role (under DPSEP), reinforcing the department’s role as a central hub for national security and emergency preparedness.

---

**Note:**  
Although the regulation is cited as being part of S.C. 2003, c. 22 (an Act passed in 2003), the transfer of duties becomes effective in 2006. This delay may reflect administrative processes, legislative implementation timelines, or policy development required before operational changes could take effect.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a formal and legally grounded transfer of the Borders Task Force from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, effective June 1, 2006. It enhances the federal government’s capacity to manage border security and public safety through improved organizational alignment and functional integration.
