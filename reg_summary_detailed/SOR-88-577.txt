**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Terra Nova Telecommunications Inc. Shares Sale Order"**

---

### **1. Background and Context**

This regulation, known as the *Terra Nova Telecommunications Inc. Shares Sale Order*, is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA). It authorizes the Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail), a Crown Corporation, to sell all of its issued and outstanding shares in **Terra Nova Telecommunications Inc. (TNT)**.

Key background facts:

- **Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail)** is a **parent Crown Corporation** — meaning it is owned by the Government of Canada and operates under public accountability.
- **Terra Nova Telecommunications Inc.** is a **wholly-owned subsidiary** of CN Rail, indicating that CN Rail holds 100% of the shares in TNT.
- The transaction is being authorized based on the **Governor in Council’s** determination that CN Rail is legally empowered under the *Canadian National Railways Act* (CNRA) to proceed with the sale.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made under two key provisions of the *Financial Administration Act*:

- **Paragraph 101(1)(d)**: This allows the Governor in Council to make orders authorizing the disposal of assets or shares of a Crown corporation when the transaction is in the public interest and consistent with the corporation’s mandate.
- **Subsection 101(7)**: This provides that the Governor in Council may make such orders **on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board**, which confirms the administrative and policy justification for the transaction.

Additionally, the Governor in Council is satisfied — based on its review — that CN Rail is **otherwise empowered** under **Section 31 of the Canadian National Railways Act** to carry out the sale. This section grants CN Rail the authority to transfer or dispose of its assets, including its ownership interests in subsidiaries, as part of its operational or strategic objectives.
