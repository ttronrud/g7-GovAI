Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the regulation you provided:

### **Detailed Summary of the Quebec Family Allowances (1988) Remission Order**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued under **section 17** of the **Financial Administration Act**.
- It is approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**.
- The decision is based on a determination that it is in the **public interest** to provide tax relief to individuals who received Quebec family allowances in 1988.

#### **2. Title of the Order**
- The Order is officially titled:  
  **"Quebec Family Allowances (1988) Remission Order"**  
  (Reference: S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4)

#### **3. Purpose of the Order**
- To **remit (forgive or refund)** income taxes, interest, and penalties that certain individuals owed in the 1988 taxation year due to the inclusion of Quebec family allowances in their taxable income.
- The remission is designed to **offset the tax burden** imposed on individuals who received family allowances under the **Family Allowances Act of the Province of Quebec**, which were previously treated as income for tax purposes — even though they were intended to support families and were not actual earnings.

#### **4. Who Is Eligible?**
- Any **individual who received family allowances** under the **Family Allowances Act of the Province of Quebec** in **1988**.

> Note: The eligibility is not based on residency or citizenship, but specifically on receiving family allowances in that year.

#### **5. How the Remission Is Calculated**
The remission amount is determined by comparing two scenarios:

| Scenario | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Actual Tax Liability** | The taxes, interest, and penalties that the individual would have owed under the **Income Tax Act (Act)** for the 1988 tax year, **including** the family allowances as part of their taxable income. |
| **Hypothetical Tax Liability** | The taxes, interest, and penalties that the individual would have owed **if the family allowances had not been included** in their taxable income for 1988. |

> The remission is **equal to the difference** between these two amounts:
>  
> **Remission Amount = (Actual Tax Liability) – (Hypothetical Tax Liability)**  
>  
> In other words, the individual receives a refund of the **extra taxes, interest, and penalties** that were paid because the family allowance was counted as income.

#### **6. Scope of the Remission**
- Applies only to:
  - **Taxes, interest, and penalties** under **Parts I and I.1** of the **Income Tax Act**.
  - These parts typically cover:
    - Income tax on personal income
    - Interest on unpaid taxes
    - Penalties for late filing or payment

> The remission **does not apply** to:
> - Other taxes (e.g., GST, corporate tax)
> - Tax credits or deductions
> - Any other forms of tax liability outside of Parts I and I.1

#### **7. Key Principle**
- The Order recognizes that **family allowances are not earned income** and should not be taxed as such.
- By remitting the excess tax burden, the government acknowledges the **non-taxable nature** of these benefits and aims to correct a **tax overreach** that occurred due to the way family allowances were treated in the income calculation.

#### **8. Legal and Policy Significance**
- This Order reflects a **policy of tax fairness** and **support for low- and middle-income families**.
- It aligns with broader efforts in the 1980s to reform family benefit systems and ensure that government support programs do not inadvertently increase the financial burden on recipients.
- It also demonstrates the **flexibility** of the Financial Administration Act in allowing targeted tax relief when it serves the public interest.

#### **9. Citation and Reference**
- The Order is cited as:  
  **S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4**  
  (This refers to the legislative source of the Financial Administration Act)

### **In Simple Terms:**
This regulation says:  
> "If you received family allowances from the Province of Quebec in 1988, and because of that, you paid more taxes (including interest and penalties) than you would have if those allowances had not been counted as income, then you are entitled to a refund of that extra amount."

It’s a **refund of overpaid taxes** due to a misclassification of family allowances as taxable income — a correction made for fairness and public benefit.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Quebec Family Allowances (1988) Remission Order** is a targeted, equitable measure that:
- Corrects a tax error,
- Reduces the financial burden on families,
- Ensures that government benefits are not treated as income for tax purposes,
- And operates under a clear, transparent formula based on actual versus hypothetical tax liabilities.

It remains a notable example of how tax policy can be adjusted to support social welfare goals while maintaining fiscal accountability.
