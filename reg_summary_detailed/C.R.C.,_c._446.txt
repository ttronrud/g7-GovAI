The provided text consists solely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed by operation of law** under:

- **1997, c. 20, s. 45**

### Detailed Summary:

**Status of the Regulation:**  
The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been **repealed** — that is, officially canceled or abolished — not by legislative action (such as a specific act of Parliament), but **by operation of law**. This means that the repeal was a result of a legal mechanism or procedural outcome inherent in the legislative or statutory framework, rather than a direct enactment by a statute.

**Legal Context:**  
- **"1997, c. 20, s. 45"** refers to a specific section (Section 45) of **Chapter 20 of the Statutes of 1997** in the jurisdiction of **Ontario, Canada** (as this format is typical of Ontario's legislative citations).  
- Chapter 20, 1997, is commonly known as the *Ontario Regulation of the Health and Safety Act* or similar, depending on the actual content. However, the specific regulation referenced here is not named in the text.  
- Section 45 of that chapter **contained the provision that was repealed**.

**Implication of Repeal:**  
- The regulation previously governed certain aspects of health, safety, or administrative procedures (the specific subject matter is not provided in the text).  
- Its repeal means that **all provisions of that regulation are no longer legally binding**.  
- Any actions, obligations, or interpretations based on that regulation are now invalid or superseded.  
- The repeal was **automatic** (by operation of law), meaning it took effect as a result of a legal rule or statutory provision, rather than being explicitly passed through a new law.

**Why "by operation of law"?**  
This phrase indicates that the repeal was not initiated by a new act of Parliament or government order, but rather followed from a legal rule embedded in the statute itself — for example, a provision that states a certain regulation shall cease to apply upon the enactment of a new law or after a certain date.

**Conclusion:**  
The regulation referenced in the text is **fully repealed and no longer in effect**. It was removed from the legal framework by a legal mechanism in 1997 under Section 45 of Chapter 20 of the Statutes of Ontario. There is no current legal authority or enforceable content derived from this regulation. Any references to it in historical records, legal documents, or administrative processes should be treated as obsolete.
