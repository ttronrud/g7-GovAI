**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Round Pigtoe (Pleurobema sintoxia) Order**

---

**1. Legal Basis and Regulatory Context**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, enacted in Canada as **S.C. 2002, c. 29**. SARA is the federal legislation designed to prevent wildlife species from becoming extinct and to promote their recovery. A key component of the Act is the identification and protection of **critical habitat**—the specific areas necessary for the survival and recovery of a listed species.

The regulation in question is a **Critical Habitat Order** for the **Round Pigtoe mussel (*Pleurobema sintoxia*)**, a species designated as **endangered** under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA.

---

**2. Background and Justification**

- **Endangered Status**: The Round Pigtoe is recognized as an endangered species under SARA. This classification triggers the legal obligation to identify and protect its critical habitat to support its recovery.

- **Recovery Strategy and Public Registry**: The recovery strategy for the Round Pigtoe, which includes a detailed description of its critical habitat, has been formally incorporated into the **Species at Risk Public Registry**. This public registry ensures transparency and accessibility of information about species at risk and their conservation needs.

- **No Conflict with Subsection 58(2)b of SARA**: The Order explicitly confirms that **no portion of the designated critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA. This provision protects certain areas (such as those used for traditional or cultural purposes by Indigenous peoples) from being designated as critical habitat if they are already set aside for Indigenous use. By confirming no such overlap, the Order avoids potential legal or procedural conflicts under this section.

**3. Consultation with Indigenous Communities**

Under **subsection 58(7)** of SARA, when a proposed critical habitat designation could affect lands set aside for the use and benefit of a **First Nation (band)**, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is required to consult with both:

- The **Minister of Indigenous Services**, and  
- The **specific band** whose traditional or reserve lands may be affected.

In this case, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has conducted such consultations. This demonstrates compliance with SARA’s requirement to respect Indigenous rights, interests, and traditional uses of land and resources, ensuring that Indigenous voices are heard in the conservation process.

**4. Legal Authority and Procedural Basis**

The Order is made pursuant to **subsections 58(4) and 58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*:

- **Section 58(4)**: Grants the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the authority to designate critical habitat for species listed under SARA.
- **Section 58(5)**: Requires that the designation be based on the recovery strategy and that it be consistent with the Act’s objectives.

Thus, this Order is a formal, legally binding designation of the specific geographic areas essential for the survival and recovery of the Round Pigtoe mussel.

**5. Scope and Effect of the Order**

- The Order identifies and designates the **critical habitat** of the Round Pigtoe (*Pleurobema sintoxia*) as specified in the annexed document.
- This designation is legally enforceable and serves as a basis for:
  - Prohibiting or restricting activities that could degrade or destroy the habitat.
  - Ensuring that any development, infrastructure, or land-use activity affecting the habitat is assessed and approved only with mitigation measures.
- The critical habitat is defined in accordance with the recovery strategy and is publicly accessible through the Species at Risk Public Registry.

---

**6. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government. This ensures immediate legal effect upon formal publication and registration, allowing for prompt implementation and enforcement.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**

- **Conservation Impact**: This Order strengthens the protection of a rare and ecologically significant species by legally defining and safeguarding its essential habitat.
- **Indigenous Engagement**: The consultation process reflects a commitment to **Indigenous partnership and co-governance** in species conservation, aligning with broader principles of reconciliation and environmental justice.
- **Legal Clarity**: By confirming no overlap with Indigenous reserve lands under subsection 58(2)b, the Order removes a potential barrier to designation and ensures compliance with both environmental and Indigenous rights frameworks.

---

**Conclusion**

This Critical Habitat Order for the Round Pigtoe (*Pleurobema sintoxia*) is a legally sound, transparent, and culturally sensitive step in the conservation of an endangered species. It reflects the full application of the *Species at Risk Act*, including its requirements for scientific basis, public access, and meaningful consultation with Indigenous communities. The Order not only protects the species’ habitat but also reinforces Canada’s commitment to biodiversity, environmental stewardship, and Indigenous partnership in conservation efforts.
