Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the **Pay Equity Regulations** (S.C. 2018, c. 27, s. 416), issued under the **Pay Equity Act**, as administered by the Government of Canada in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour.

## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Pay Equity Regulations (S.C. 2018, c. 27, s. 416)**

These regulations provide the **operational framework** for implementing the **Pay Equity Act**, which mandates that employers in the federal public sector ensure **equal pay for equal work** between men and women, particularly in job classes that are predominantly female or predominantly male. The regulations clarify key definitions, procedural requirements, and detailed methodologies for comparing and adjusting compensation across job classes to eliminate gender-based pay disparities.

## 📚 2. **Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Pay Equity Act*. |
| **Band** | Same meaning as in subsection 49(2) of the Act — a grouping of job classes with similar levels of responsibility, skill, and complexity. |
| **Frozen compensation** | Compensation that cannot be changed without specific legal or collective agreement constraints. Includes: |
| | - Salary under section 107 of the *Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act* (FPLRA);<br> - Salary under a collective agreement where a strike could be declared without violating subsection 194(1) of the FPLRA or where conditions in paragraphs 89(1)(a)–(d) of the *Canada Labour Code* are met;<br> - Salary that cannot be altered under: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Section 56 of the FPLRA (requires collective agreement or board consent),<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Subsection 24(4) of the *Canada Labour Code* (requires collective agreement or board consent), or<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Paragraph 50(b) of the *Canada Labour Code* (requires bargaining agent consent). |

> ⚠️ **Critical Note**: Frozen compensation **cannot be compared** with non-frozen compensation in predominantly female or male job classes **unless** a specific adjustment is made to account for differences due to freezing.

## 🏢 3. **Group of Employers and Single Employer Status**

- If a group of employers is recognized by the **Pay Equity Commissioner** as a **single employer** under **section 106 of the Act**, then:
  - All references in sections 10, 14, 15, 18–20, 22, 23(1)–(6), 24–26, 28–31, 38.1, 39, and 41–46.1 to "an employer" must be read as referring to the **entire group**, unless context otherwise requires.

> ✅ This ensures **consistency and fairness** in pay equity planning across related employers (e.g., federal departments or agencies operating under shared governance).

---

## 📢 4. **Posting Requirements for Documents**

All documents required under the Act must be:
- Posted in **printed or electronic form**;
- Made **readily accessible** to all affected employees;
- Posted in a **conspicuous place** (for printed forms);
- **Accessible** to employees with disabilities under the *Accessible Canada Act* (e.g., in accessible formats like Braille, audio, screen-reader compatible).

### Specific Rules:
- **Electronic posting**: Employers must provide employees with **necessary information** to access the document (e.g., login details, links).
- **Posting date**: Must be clearly indicated on all notices.
- **Notice of Pay Equity Plan (subsections 14(1) or (2))**:
  - Must be posted **within 60 days** of becoming subject to the Act.
  - Must remain posted until:
    - A final pay equity plan is posted (per subsection 55(1) or 57(2)(b) or 94(1)(b));
    - A new notice under subsection 15(1) or (2) is posted;
    - The group becomes required to establish more than one pay equity plan.

### For Groups Recognized as a Single Employer:
- Must post the notice **within 60 days of recognition**, **but no later than the date the group becomes subject to the Act**.
- The notice must remain posted until:
  - Each employer in the group posts its final pay equity plan;
  - A notice under subsection 14(1) or (2) is posted;
  - The group is required to establish multiple pay equity plans.

### For Plans Established Without a Pay Equity Committee (sections 25, 26, 28, 29):
- Must be posted **within 60 days** after the Pay Equity Commissioner approves the plan.
- Must remain posted until the final version of the plan is published.

## 📊 5. **Comparison of Compensation (Sections 47–50)**

This is the **core mechanism** of the Pay Equity Act. The goal is to ensure that **women and men are paid equally for equal work**, adjusting for differences in value of work performed.

### 🔒 **Prohibition on Comparing Frozen vs. Non-Frozen Compensation**

- **No comparison** may be made between:
  - Frozen compensation in a predominantly female or male job class,
  - And non-frozen compensation in a predominantly female or male job class **with unionized employees**,
  **unless** the frozen compensation rate is adjusted using one of the following methods:

#### ✅ Adjustment Method (for frozen compensation):
> The salary rate used to determine frozen compensation must be:
> 
> **Option 1**: The highest salary rate in the job class **plus** the product of:
> - The highest salary rate in the job class,
> - The **average percentage increase** in salaries for unionized positions (in job classes with collective agreements) **since the job class became frozen**.

> **Option 2 (if a pay equity committee exists)**: A method that **minimizes differences** in compensation solely due to the job class being frozen.

> This ensures that frozen pay differences are not unfairly attributed to gender, but rather to historical labor market conditions.

## 📐 6. **Calculation of Key Factors (Sections 11, 12, 28, 29, 50)**

These formulas determine the **magnitude of pay equity adjustments** needed.

### A. **Factor in Section 49(1)(d) and 28(d)**  
Used to calculate the **overall difference in compensation** between predominantly female and male job classes within a band.

> Formula:
>  
> $$
> \text{Factor} = \frac{(\text{Sum of differences for female job classes below B})}{\text{Number of predominantly female job classes}}
> $$
>  
> Where:
> - **B** = Average compensation of predominantly male job classes (or compensation under 49(1)(b) if no male classes exist),
> - **Sum of differences** = For each predominantly female job class with compensation < B, the difference between B and actual compensation.

> ⚠️ Applies only to **female job classes below the male regression line**.

---

### B. **Factor in Section 50(1)(c) and 29(1)(c)**  
Used to calculate **how much compensation must be increased** for female job classes below the male regression line.

> Formula:
>  
> $$
> \text{Factor} = \frac{(\text{Sum of } (W \times (C_{\text{male}} - C_{\text{female}})))}{\text{Sum of } (W \times C_{\text{male}})}
> $$
>  
> Where:
> - $ W $ = Value of work performed in the job class,
> - $ C_{\text{male}} $ = Compensation if the job class were on the male regression line (equal work value),
> - $ C_{\text{female}} $ = Actual compensation.

> **Key elements**:
> - Compares work value and compensation.
> - Accounts for **value of work performed**, not just job title.
> - Ensures women are compensated based on **equal value of work**, not gender.

> **Sub-formulas**:
> - **J** = Sum of products of work value × (difference in compensation) for female classes below the regression line.
> - **M** = Sum of work value × compensation of predominantly male classes on the regression line.
> - **N** = Sum of absolute differences in compensation for female classes below the line.
> - **Increase in compensation** = Factor × Absolute difference.

> This ensures that **adjustments are proportional** to both the gap and the value of
