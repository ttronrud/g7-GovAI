## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Weights and Measures Regulations (Repealed Sections Noted)**

This regulation establishes definitions, exemptions, and procedural requirements for devices used in trade under the *Weights and Measures Act* (Act). It governs the accuracy, approval, examination, marking, and use of measuring devices such as scales, tanks, meters, and packaging systems. Several sections have been **repealed**, and certain exemptions are conditional or time-limited.

## 📚 I. Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Acceptance Limits of Error** | The maximum allowable error for a device at specific times:<br>• When the class/type/design is first evaluated for approval;<br>• Before first use in trade;<br>• After repair/replacement due to failure to meet error limits;<br>• Within 30 days of any of the above. |
| **Act** | Refers to the *Weights and Measures Act* (S.C. 1970–72, c. 36). |
| **Canadian Unit** | Units listed in **Schedule II** of the Act (e.g., kilogram, litre, metre). |
| **Examination Mark** | A mark indicating the year a device was last examined. |
| **Examination Sticker** | A self-adhesive label showing:<br>• Month and year of examination;<br>• Next required examination date (as per section 15 and section 29). |
| **Height** | For lettering: height of uppercase letter if text is in uppercase, or lowercase "o" if in mixed case. |
| **In-Service Limits of Error** | Error limits applied during routine use (not during initial approval, repair, or first use). |
| **Measurement Canada Office** | Any office of the Department of Industry responsible for administering the Act. |
| **Measuring Tank** | Any tank (fixed, portable, or vehicle-mounted) used to measure liquid volume in trade. |
| **Metric Unit** | Units listed in **Schedule I** of the Act (e.g., metre, litre, gram). |
| **Packing Device** | A device that measures a fixed quantity without recording each individual measurement or with no human observation/record-keeping. |
| **Previous Enactment** | Any pre-1970–72 legislation on weights and measures and regulations made under it. |
| **Standard Quantity Commodity** | A commodity part of a lot with identical net quantity statements (e.g., identical-sized bags of sugar). |
| **Vehicle Tank** | A measuring tank mounted on a vehicle (excluding railway vehicles). |
| **Weights and Measures Office** | Repealed (SOR/2005-297, s.1). |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Several terms like "automatic weighing device" and "non-automatic weighing device" have been **repealed** (SOR/2005-130, s.1 and SOR/2014-111, s.1), meaning they no longer apply.

## 🚫 II. Exemptions from the Act (Where Devices Are Not Regulated)

### A. **General Exemptions (Where Class, Type, or Design is Exempt)**

A class, type, or design of device is exempt from the Act if:
1. It is subject to verification under the *Electricity and Gas Inspection Act*; or  
2. It is designed for use **only in laboratories or scientific research**, and **not approved under section 3** of the Act.

---

### B. **Exemptions Based on Use (Specific Devices or Activities)**

#### 1. **Downstream Petroleum Trade**
- Exempt from section 8 and subsection 15(1) if used for:
  - Gauging **tanker ship holds or tanks >55,000 L** (12,000 gallons) in downstream petroleum trade (refineries → wholesalers → retailers).
  - Gauging ship holds used in **wholesale trade of mining products**.

#### 2. **Specific Device Types Exempt from Section 8 & Subsection 15(1)**

These devices are exempt **regardless of use**:
- Water meters  
- Parking meters  
- Taxi meters  
- Odometers of motor vehicles  
- Coin-operated machines that weigh persons  
- Payment-operated machines dispensing liquid **without recording dispensed volume** (mechanical/electrical indicators not used)  
- Clocks, watches, chronometers, and time-measuring devices  
- Milk measuring tanks for **farm use**  
- Measuring tanks mounted on **railway cars**  
- Tanks with capacity **exceeding 55,000 L or 12,000 gallons**  
- Meters for measuring **grease or similar flowable commodities**  
- Static measures used as **containers for sale**  
- Packing devices  
- Laboratory or scientific weighing machines (used for precious metals or high-value commodities), **if**:

  - Were **examined and certified before December 31, 1981**  
- Linear static measures  
- Devices used in **downstream petroleum trade** to measure liquids in **permanent closed piping systems** (e.g., from refinery to storage), **except** when the product reaches a consumer or processing point where it is no longer considered a hydrocarbon.

#### 3. **Exemption for Standard Quantity Commodities and Crude Petroleum**

A device is exempt from section 8 and subsection 15(1) if it is used **exclusively** to:
