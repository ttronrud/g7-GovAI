## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Formal Documents Regulations**

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled: **"The Formal Documents Regulations"**.
- It may be cited as: **Formal Documents Regulations**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Privy Seal** | The official seal adopted by the Governor General or the Administrator for sealing documents that are to be signed by them or their deputy. These documents do **not** require the Great Seal. <br> *(French: "sceau privé")* |
| **Permanent** | Refers to a commission, board, or corporation established **without any time limit** — i.e., it continues indefinitely. <br> *(French: "permanent")* |
| **Regular** | A person appointed on a **permanent basis**. <br> *(French: "régulier")* |
| **Temporary** | A commission, board, or corporation established for a **specific period of time** or until a particular event occurs. <br> *(French: "temporaire")* |
| **Temporary or ad hoc** | A person appointed **specifically for a short duration** or until a stated event occurs. <br> *(French: "temporaire ou spécial (ad hoc)")* |

> These definitions clarify the nature and duration of appointments and institutions, which directly influence which seal is required for official documents.

### **3. General Rule on Sealing and Signing of Documents**

- **Every document issued under seal** must bear the **signature of the person holding the office** indicated in the document.
- **Exception**: If a document requires signing by the **deputy head of a department**, it may instead be signed by the **head or acting head** of that department.

> This ensures administrative flexibility while maintaining accountability and authority.

---

### **4. Re-appointment and Commissions**

- **No automatic commission upon re-appointment**:  
  Nothing in these regulations requires the issuance of a formal commission (i.e., a legal document) when a person is re-appointed to an office — **unless** the commission itself serves as the instrument of re-appointment.

> This means that re-appointments may occur without issuing a new commission, unless explicitly required by the nature of the appointment.

---

### **5. Exception for Key Appointments**

- For documents concerning:
  - The **appointment of the Attorney General** or the **Minister of Industry**, or
  - The appointment of a person to **concurrently hold two offices**,

  These documents that are required to be issued under seal and signed by the **Attorney General or Registrar General** may instead be signed by the **Prime Minister**.

> This provides a practical exception for high-level appointments involving concurrent roles, allowing the Prime Minister to act with delegated authority in certain cases.

---

### **6. Commissions Issued Under the Great Seal (Affixed by the Registrar General)**

These commissions are issued to individuals appointed to the following offices:

| Office | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Sovereign | The Crown (e.g., the King/Queen) |
| Prime Minister | Head of Government |
| Registrar General | Head of the Office of the Registrar General |
| Governor General | Head of the Executive Branch (representing the Crown) |
| Attorney General | Head of the Department of Justice |
| Deputy Registrar General | Deputy to the Registrar General |
| Deputy Attorney General | Deputy to the Attorney General |
| Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Nunavut | Appointed to lead Nunavut's administrative bodies |

> **Note**: The list includes multiple repetitions, which may reflect:
> - Historical or transitional entries,
> - Typographical duplication,
> - Or different versions of the same appointments.

> The **Great Seal** is used for appointments of **high-ranking, constitutional offices**, especially those involving the Crown or national leadership.

---

### **7. Commissions Issued Under the Privy Seal (Affixed by the Secretary to the Governor General or the Registrar General)**

These commissions are issued to individuals appointed to the following offices:

#### a) Under the Privy Seal, affixed by the **Secretary to the Governor General**:
- Governor General
- Minister of National Defence

> This indicates that the **Minister of National Defence** is appointed via the Privy Seal, reflecting the importance of defence in national governance.

#### b) Under the Privy Seal, affixed by the **Registrar General**:
- Governor General
- Deputy Registrar General
- Administrator
- Administrator
- Minister of National Defence
- Administrator
- Minister of National Defence

> Note: Some entries are duplicated, likely due to formatting or editorial errors. The core appointments are:
> - Governor General
> - Deputy Registrar General
> - Administrator
> - Minister of National Defence

> The **Administrator** (e.g., in territories like Nunavut) is included under the Privy Seal, indicating that territorial leadership roles are also formally recognized under this seal.

---

### **8. Commissions Issued Under the Seal of the Registrar General**

These commissions are issued to individuals appointed to the following offices:

| Office | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Deputy Governor | Deputy to the Governor General |
| Deputy Registrar General | Deputy to the Registrar General |
| Deputy Attorney General | Deputy to the Attorney General |

> These are **deputy-level appointments**, and the seal of the **Registrar General** is sufficient for such appointments.

> This reflects a tiered system: the **Great Seal** for top-tier offices, the **Privy Seal** for key ministerial and territorial roles, and the **Registrar General's Seal** for deputy-level positions.

---

### **9. Documents Issued Under the Great Seal (Affixed by the Registrar General)**

| Deputy Registrar General | Appointment of deputy |

## 🔍 Key Observations and Interpretations

1. **Hierarchical Structure of Seals**:
   - **Great Seal**: Highest authority — used for appointments of the Sovereign, Prime Minister, Governor General, and major constitutional offices.
   - **Privy Seal**: Second tier — used for key ministerial and territorial appointments, especially involving the Governor General or Minister of National Defence.
   - **Registrar General’s Seal**: Used for deputy-level appointments, indicating a delegation of authority.

2. **Constitutional Significance**:
   - The use of the **Great Seal** for appointments to the Crown, Prime Minister, and Attorney General reflects their constitutional importance.
   - The **Privy Seal** is tied to executive appointments, particularly in defense and governance.

3. **Flexibility and Exceptions**:
   - The Prime Minister may sign documents related to appointments of the Attorney General or Minister of Industry — a practical exception that streamlines governance.
   - Re-appointments do not require new commissions unless the commission itself is the instrument of re-appointment.

4. **Repetition and Errors**:
   - The regulation contains **repeated entries** (e.g., multiple lines for the same office), which may be due to:
     - Copy-paste errors,
     - Legislative drafting inconsistencies,
     - Or historical revisions.
   - These repetitions do not change the substantive meaning but may cause confusion in interpretation.

5. **Territorial Representation**:
   - The inclusion of **Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Nunavut** under the Great Seal reflects the recognition of Nunavut as a distinct territory with formal governance structures.

6. **Repealed Clause**:
   - The line `[Repealed, SOR/2000-79, s. 9]` indicates that one of the Privy Seal provisions (likely the final one) was removed by **Statutory Order 2000-79, Section 9** — suggesting a modernization or simplification of the regulations.
