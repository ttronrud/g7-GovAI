**Detailed Summary of the Regulation Under the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulatory decision, issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* (S.C. 2002, c. 29), outlines a comprehensive assessment and final determination regarding the status of several wildlife species in Canada. The key actions taken include:

1. **Deciding not to list four specific populations** of species on the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk* (Schedule 1 to SARA).
2. **Referring six other species** back to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for further evaluation and clarification.
3. **Approving public disclosure** of the reasons for both the non-listing decisions and the referrals in the *public registry* under Section 120 of SARA.

## **Part 1: Non-Listing of Four Populations**

### **1. Atlantic Cod Populations (Not Listed)**  
The Minister of the Environment has recommended that **three populations of Atlantic Cod** not be added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk:

- **Newfoundland and Labrador Population**
- **Laurentian North Population**
- **Maritimes Population**

#### **Background on Atlantic Cod**
- Atlantic Cod (*Gadus morhua*) is a widespread marine fish found throughout the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic Ocean.
- In Canada, it ranges from the Bay of Fundy to the eastern shores of Labrador and Baffin Island, with landlocked populations on Baffin Island.
- Maturity age varies: 2–3 years in southern waters (e.g., Georges Bank), 5–7 years in northern areas.
- Coloration varies by region (black, brown, red).

#### **COSEWIC Assessments**
- **Newfoundland and Labrador**: Endangered  
- **Laurentian North**: Threatened  
- **Maritimes**: Special Concern  

Threats identified include:
- Overfishing
- Predation by seals and other fish
- Ecosystem changes (natural and fishing-induced)

Despite historical declines, **current abundance levels are variable**, with some stocks showing recovery—particularly in near-shore Newfoundland and Labrador waters. Sustainable fisheries are supported in certain regions.

### **Reasons for Not Listing (Socio-Economic and Practical Considerations)**

1. **Significant Socio-Economic Impact**  
   - Listing these populations would have **severe negative consequences** for rural coastal communities in **Newfoundland and Labrador** and **Quebec’s Lower North Shore**.
   - These communities are deeply tied to the cod fishery, both economically and culturally. The cod fishery is central to the **identity and heritage** of many rural populations.
   - In 2003, closures of directed cod fisheries triggered **strong public backlash**, including from industry and provincial governments.

2. **Projected Financial and Employment Losses**  
   - If the Newfoundland and Labrador and Laurentian North populations were listed:
     - **$82 million in losses** to fishing and processing sectors
     - **9,764 fishers and crew** would be affected
     - **1,348 processing jobs** would be lost
   - The Maritimes population, designated as *Special Concern*, is **not subject to SARA prohibitions**, so no direct restrictions would apply.

3. **Uncertain Long-Term Benefits**  
   - Any ecological benefits from listing (e.g., population recovery) would likely take **many years** to materialize.
   - The current workforce in these regions is aging, and many are already facing economic hardship due to decades of fishery decline.
   - The people who suffer the immediate costs may **not benefit** from future recovery, creating a significant equity and fairness concern.

4. **Existing Conservation Measures**  
   - A robust suite of conservation tools already exists:
     - Moratoria on directed fishing
     - Reduced harvests of capelin (a key prey species)
     - Mandatory harvest plans for groundfish
     - At-sea observers to monitor fishing
   - Three **federal-provincial Cod Action Teams** (established since 2003) have developed and implemented **rebuilding strategies** for most stocks.

5. **Preference for Integrated, Atlantic-Wide Management**  
   - The government believes the most effective path forward is **cooperative, science-based, and regionally coordinated management** through the existing Cod Action Teams.
   - This approach allows for **flexible, adaptive, and collaborative recovery** rather than rigid, top-down listing decisions.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: The government determines that **non-listing is the most appropriate and practical course**, given the current recovery trajectory, socio-economic realities, and the effectiveness of existing management tools.

### **2. Coho Salmon (Interior Fraser Population) – Not Listed**

#### **Background on Interior Fraser Coho Salmon**
- One of six native salmon species in North America.
- Spends first year in freshwater, then 18 months in the ocean, returning to spawn and die.
- The **Interior Fraser Coho** are genetically distinct and occupy a large portion of Canada’s Coho range.
- They are found in the upper Fraser and Thompson River systems (Thompson is the largest tributary).

#### **COSEWIC Assessment**
- Designated as **Endangered** due to:
  - Overfishing
  - Changing marine conditions
  - Habitat degradation

#### **Reasons for Not Listing**

1. **Uncertainty in Marine Survival**  
   - There is significant uncertainty about how marine conditions (e.g., temperature, food availability) will affect survival rates in the future.
   - If marine conditions improve, survival could increase—leading to potential recovery and **increased harvest opportunities**.

2. **Uncertainty in Future Socio-Economic Impacts**  
   - **Foregone revenue** from listing could range from **$4.9 million to $52.9 million (present value)** over 2009–2016.
   - Direct employment impacts: **350 to 2,160 person-years**.
   - Recreational losses: **$41.9 million to $227 million** due to reduced angling opportunities.

3. **Current Restrictions on Harvest**  
   - Legally harvested fish are currently **prohibited from sale**, which limits economic recovery.
   - It is expected that these restrictions will be lifted only when populations recover sufficiently.

4. **Need for Management Flexibility**  
   - Listing would lock in current restrictions and prevent future adjustments in response to changing environmental conditions.
   - The government believes **non-listing provides essential flexibility** to manage the species based on real-time data and emerging conditions.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Given the **uncertainty in marine survival** and **potential for future economic gains**, the decision to **not list** the Interior Fraser Coho Salmon is made to preserve management flexibility and avoid premature restrictions that could hinder recovery.

## **Part 2: Referrals to COSEWIC**

Six additional species are being **referred back to COSEWIC** for further review and clarification. These include:

1. **Lake Winnipeg Physa** (*Physa sp.*)  
2. **Bocaccio Rockfish** (*Sebastes paucispinis*)  
3. **Shortjaw Cisco** (*Coregonus zenithicus*)  
4. **Cusk** (*Brosme brosme*)  
5. **Northwest Atlantic Population of Harbour Porpoise** (*Phocoena phocoena*)  
6. **Arctic Population of Atlantic Cod** (*Gadus morhua*)

### **Reasons for Referral**

Each species has **gaps or weaknesses** in the original assessment that require further scientific scrutiny and input from COSEWIC.

| Species | Key Issues |
|--------|-----------|
| **Lake Winnipeg Physa** | Based on an **unpeer-reviewed scientific paper**; unclear whether it is a distinct species or a variant of a more common one. |
| **Bocaccio Rockfish** | Two **subsequent scientific assessments** reported different abundance levels; **data strength is questionable**. |
| **Cusk** | Assessment relied heavily on **trawl survey data**, which may have **overestimated declines** due to methodological bias. |
| **Harbour Porpoise (Northwest Atlantic)** | Combined **three sub-populations** without sufficient data to estimate abundance for two of them. |
| **Arctic Atlantic Cod** | **Lacks Aboriginal traditional knowledge**; does not clearly distinguish between **landlocked and marine stocks**. |
| **Shortjaw Cisco** | **Lacks Aboriginal traditional knowledge**; applies a **single designable unit** when there is insufficient information to justify it. |

### **Specific Requirements for COSEWIC Review**

COSEWIC will be asked to evaluate and respond to the following:

1. **Speciation and Designable Units**  
   - Are species clearly defined and distinct?  
   - Are the designable units (i.e., geographic or ecological boundaries for assessment) appropriately and scientifically justified?

2. **Use of Abundance and Distribution Data**  
   - Have all available data on abundance and distribution been appropriately used and analyzed?  
   - Are data sources reliable and representative?

3. **Inclusion of Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (ATK)**  
   - Has ATK been properly considered and integrated in the assessment process?  
   - Especially relevant for Arctic Cod and Shortjaw Cisco.

> 🔍 **Purpose of Referral**: To ensure that any
