The provided text consists entirely of repeals of a specific regulation, with multiple instances of the same citation:

- **Repealed, SOR/2009-296, s. 9**  
- **Repealed, SOR/2011-13, s. 1** (repeated nine times)

### Summary:

This information indicates that the regulation in question has been **officially repealed** (cancelled or removed) by subsequent statutory instruments of the Government of Canada.

- **SOR/2009-296, section 9** and  
- **SOR/2011-13, section 1**

were the legal instruments that formally **repealed** the original regulation. The repeated citations of SOR/2011-13, s. 1 suggest that the repeal was applied multiple times or that the section in question had broader applicability, possibly repealing several provisions or subsections.

### Key Points:

1. **Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**.
2. **Reason for Repeal**: The regulation was replaced or superseded by newer legislation or policy, likely due to changes in the regulatory framework, redundancy, or inconsistency with current laws.
3. **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of the **Statutory Instruments (SOR)** system, which allows the federal government to amend or remove regulations through formal legislative instruments.
4. **Effective Date**: The repeal became effective upon the publication of the respective statutory instrument in the *Supplementary Orders and Regulations* (SOR) series.

### Implications:

- Any legal or administrative action based on this regulation is now **invalid**.
- Legal practitioners, regulators, or organizations relying on this regulation must refer to current, active legislation or updated regulatory frameworks.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory modernization or consolidation effort.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the original text has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer applicable**. It was officially removed from the legal framework through **SOR/2009-296, s. 9** and **SOR/2011-13, s. 1**, with the latter being cited repeatedly—possibly indicating a broad or cumulative repeal effect.
