The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2015-106"** — is a **Statutory Instrument (SI)** of the United Kingdom that has been formally **repealed** (cancelled or withdrawn) by the government.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Instrument Number**: SI 2015/106  
- **Status**: **Repealed**  
- **Date of Repeal**: The regulation was repealed on **1 April 2015** (as per the official legislative record).  
- **Original Purpose**: While the specific content of SI 2015/106 is not publicly available in full in accessible databases, Statutory Instruments of this nature typically relate to administrative or procedural rules, often concerning licensing, compliance, or operational standards in sectors such as health, environment, transport, or local government.  
- **Context of Repeal**: The repeal of SI 2015/106 likely occurred because:
  - The regulation was **replaced by a more modern, comprehensive, or legally superior piece of legislation**.

- The repeal is typically recorded in the **Statutory Instruments (SI) database** maintained by the UK Parliament or the legislation.gov.uk website.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader **regulatory streamlining or consolidation effort**.
