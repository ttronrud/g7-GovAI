**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Order Respecting the Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Lands in the Northwest Territories (Giant Mine)*

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific subsurface rights** from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of disposition) at the **abandoned Giant Mine site in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories**. This action is taken to:

1. **Enable environmental remediation** of the site, which has been identified as a contaminated and hazardous location due to historical mining activities.
2. **Prevent potential conflicts** with other land users, including environmental agencies, Indigenous communities, or future developers, by ensuring that the subsurface rights are not available for competitive bidding or commercial exploitation during the remediation phase.

---

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Withdrawal of Subsurface Rights**
- The **subsurface rights** of certain tracts of territorial land located at the **Giant Mine site** are **withdrawn from disposal**.
- This withdrawal applies **only to subsurface rights**, not to surface rights or other forms of land use.
- The withdrawal is effective **from the date the Order is made** and remains in force for the duration of the remediation process, unless otherwise amended or terminated.

#### **2. Scope of Land Affected**
- The affected land is located in the **Yellowknife area**, specifically:
  - **Mineral claim sheet**: 85J/9
  - **Quad number**: 85J/9
- The parcel is **outlined in red** on a sketch plan (file number: **33-1-5-14**) held in the **Land Management Division** of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in Ottawa.
- The total area of the parcel is approximately **1,622.73 hectares**.

#### **3. Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Important Exceptions)**

Despite the general withdrawal of subsurface rights, **section 2 of the Order does not apply** in the following specific situations:

| Exception | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-existing prospecting claims** | A person holding a prospecting permit issued **before** the Order came into effect may still locate a mineral claim. |
| **Pre-existing recorded mineral claims** | Any mineral claim that was already recorded or located prior to the Order’s effective date remains valid and unaffected. |
| **Leases under Canada Mining Regulations** | A lease can be granted to a holder of a recorded claim if the lease covers land within that claim — such leases are not blocked. |
| **Significant Discovery Licences** | A significant discovery licence issued under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to a holder of a prior exploration licence (issued before the Order) is not prohibited if it covers land under the exploration licence. |
| **Production Licences** | Production licences issued to holders of prior exploration or significant discovery licences (issued before the Order) are not affected if they cover areas subject to those earlier licences. |
| **Surface Leases** | A surface lease can be granted to a claim holder (under Canada Mining Regulations or Canada Petroleum Resources Act) if required to allow the holder to exercise rights under their claim or interest. |
| **Renewal of Interests** | Renewals of existing mineral interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are not impacted by the withdrawal. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: These exceptions ensure that **existing rights and ongoing operations** are not disrupted, particularly those already established before the Order was issued. This maintains legal continuity and protects legitimate claims and investment.

#### **4. Limitation on Application**

- The withdrawal **does not apply** to:
  - The **disposition of substances or materials** under the *Territorial Quarrying Regulations*.
  - Any activity related to **mineral extraction or processing** that is already authorized or regulated under other specific statutes.

### **Legal Basis**

The Order is authorized under **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which allows the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to withdraw land from disposal for public interest or environmental protection purposes.

---

### **Implications and Significance**

- **Environmental Protection**: This step is a critical part of the environmental cleanup of the Giant Mine, which has long been a source of contamination due to the release of heavy metals and radioactive materials into the surrounding environment.
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: By clearly defining which rights are withdrawn and which are preserved, the Order provides clarity for Indigenous communities, regulators, and environmental agencies.
- **Prevention of Conflicts**: It avoids a scenario where commercial parties could bid for the same subsurface rights while remediation is underway, which could lead to legal disputes or delays.
- **Balanced Approach**: The regulation strikes a balance between protecting public interest (remediation) and respecting existing legal rights and investments.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a targeted, legally sound measure to **protect the environment and ensure orderly remediation** at the Giant Mine site in Yellowknife. It withdraws subsurface rights from disposal to allow for safe and effective cleanup, while **preserving the validity and enforceability of pre-existing mineral claims and related rights**. The regulation demonstrates a commitment to environmental stewardship and legal certainty in land management, particularly in sensitive or contaminated areas.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Withdrawal applies only to **subsurface rights**.
- Effective from the **date of issuance**.
- Covers **~1,622.73 hectares** in Yellowknife, mineral claim sheet 85J/9.
- **Exemptions** protect pre-existing claims, leases, and renewals.
- Does **not affect** disposal of materials under quarrying regulations.
- Based on **section 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**.

This regulation is a vital component of Canada’s broader strategy to manage and remediate legacy mining sites in a safe, transparent, and equitable manner.
