#### **2. Legal Basis of Appointment**
The proclamation establishes that LeBlanc was appointed to the office of **Governor General and Commander-in-Chief in and over Canada** by **Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II**, through a **Commission under the Great Seal of Canada**, dated **January 16, 1995**.

This appointment is rooted in **Letters Patent**, specifically:
- The original Letters Patent dated **September 8, 1947**, which establish the Office of Governor General and Commander-in-Chief.

  - **Members of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**.
