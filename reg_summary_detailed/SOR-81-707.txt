### **Detailed Summary of the Inuvik Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The **Inuvik Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. This establishes the legal foundation for regulating land use around Inuvik Airport to ensure aviation safety and operational integrity.

These regulations are formally titled the **Inuvik Airport Zoning Regulations** and apply specifically to the Inuvik Airport and its surrounding areas in the **Northwest Territories**.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Inuvik Airport and its immediate vicinity in the Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. Located at coordinates: <br> Latitude 68°18′18.7789″, Longitude 133°29′05.2246″ <br> Coincides with **Coordinate Control Survey Monument No. 139302 (c.c.m. 32)**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 04–22). It slopes at a 1:50 ratio (1 meter rise per 50 meters run) and rises to a horizontal line 300 meters above the end of the strip, extending 15,000 meters horizontally. The outer ends of this line are 2,400 meters from the runway centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal imaginary plane located **45 meters above the assigned elevation of the ARP (60.04 m ASL)**. However, if this results in a height less than 9 meters above ground level, the surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to avoid impracticality. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area for aircraft, specifically the **runway 04–22**, which is **300 meters wide** (150 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,948.8 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, sloping at a 1:7 ratio (1 meter rise per 7 meters run), rising to meet the outer surface. |

> **Assigned Elevation**: The ARP is officially assigned an elevation of **60.04 meters above sea level (ASL)**, which serves as the baseline for all elevation-based calculations.

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to all lands:
- Within the designated airport boundaries, and  
- Directly beneath any portion of the **approach surface** that extends beyond the outer limits.

This includes:
- Public road allowances
- Private lands adjacent to or near the airport

The outer limits of these lands are defined by a **circular boundary** with a radius of **4,000 meters**, centered at the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

> **Boundary Description**:  
> Begins at the intersection of the southern boundary of **Lot 3, Group 1355, Plan 43574 (C.L.S.R.) 218 (L.T.O.)** with a circle of 4,000 meters radius centered at the ARP.  
> Proceeds **clockwise along the circumference** of this circle until it intersects the northern boundary of the same lot.  
> This boundary is illustrated on **Department of Transport Inuvik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1552**.

#### **4. Prohibitions on Construction and Development**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or build any structure, building, or object (including additions to existing ones)  
- On any land covered by these regulations  
- Where the **highest point** of such structure or object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

This restriction ensures that obstacles (such as hills, buildings, or trees) do not interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**
If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** requiring the:
- Owner or occupier of the land  
- To remove or trim the excessive growth.

This provision helps maintain clear airspace and prevents vegetation from becoming a hazard during flight operations.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on Waste Disposal**
No owner or occupier of regulated land may:
- Use the land or any part of it for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - Edible by birds  
  - Attractive to birds  

This rule is critical to **prevent bird attraction**, which could lead to bird strikes—a major aviation safety risk.

---

#### **7. Visual and Spatial Representation**
All surfaces (approach, outer, transitional, and strip) are clearly depicted on:
> **Department of Transport Inuvik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1552**

This plan serves as the official visual reference for:
- Boundary lines  
- Surface contours  
- Runway alignment and dimensions  
- Elevation gradients  

It is essential for compliance, planning, and enforcement.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aviation Safety** | Prevents obstructions (buildings, trees, debris) that could interfere with aircraft during critical phases of flight. |
| **Consistent Elevation Standards** | Uses a precise reference point (ARP) and standardized slope ratios (1:50 for approach, 1:7 for transition) to ensure uniformity and predictability. |
| **Environmental Protection** | Prevents bird-attracting waste disposal, reducing the risk of bird strikes. |
| **Land Use Control** | Clearly defines the boundaries and restrictions, providing legal clarity for landowners and developers. |
| **Regulatory Enforcement** | Empowers the Minister to issue directions for removal of overgrown vegetation, enabling proactive management. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Inuvik Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, science-based framework for managing land use around Inuvik Airport. By defining precise spatial boundaries, elevation limits, and prohibited activities, the regulations ensure the safety and operational efficiency of aviation at this remote northern airport. The use of a fixed reference point, standardized slope ratios, and clear enforcement mechanisms reflects a professional and proactive approach to aviation safety in a challenging Arctic environment.

These regulations are not only a technical document but also a vital component of regional infrastructure planning, balancing community development with the critical needs of air transport in the Northwest Territories.
