**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued under the authority of Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, formally **terminates** the prior authorization established by **Order in Council P.C. 2003-2092**, dated December 12, 2003. That earlier order had granted the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (formerly known as the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) the authority to act as a Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians and to enter into contribution agreements with organizations representing Métis and off-reserve Aboriginal peoples.

The current regulation **replaces** that earlier authorization with a new, specific mandate, effective **July 20, 2004**. Under this updated authority:

1. **Designation of Federal Interlocutor**:  
   The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is formally designated as the **Federal Interlocutor** for Métis and Non-Status Indians. This role gives the Minister the responsibility of engaging in negotiations, consultations, and agreements on matters related to the rights, interests, and self-governance of these groups.

2. **Scope of Authority**:  
   The Minister is authorized to enter into **contribution agreements** with organizations that represent Métis and off-reserve Aboriginal peoples. These agreements are typically designed to support shared objectives such as:
   - Infrastructure development
   - Economic development
   - Cultural preservation
   - Education and health initiatives
   - Community-based programs

   The term "contribution agreements" implies that the federal government will provide financial or in-kind support (a contribution) in exchange for commitments from the organizations (often community-based or Indigenous-led) to deliver specific services or outcomes.

3. **Target Groups**:  
   The regulation specifically applies to:
   - **Métis** (a distinct Indigenous group recognized under Canadian law, with historical and cultural ties to the land and distinct identity)
   - **Non-Status Indians** (Indigenous individuals who are not registered on a reserve and are not part of a recognized band or status under the Indian Act)

   These groups are not represented through the traditional band or reserve-based structures and often operate outside the formal reserve system.

4. **Purpose and Context**:  
   The regulation reflects a shift in federal policy toward **greater recognition and engagement** with Métis and non-status Indigenous peoples. It acknowledges their distinct status and the need for direct federal engagement to support their development, self-determination, and access to resources and services.

5. **Effective Date**:  
   The new authority takes effect on **July 20, 2004**, marking a significant step in the federal government’s efforts to formalize and operationalize intergovernmental and inter-organizational partnerships with Métis and off-reserve Aboriginal communities.

6. **Legal Basis**:  
   The power to issue such an Order in Council derives from the **Indian Act** and broader federal legislative authority to manage Indigenous relations and promote self-governance. The Governor General in Council acts on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, indicating that this decision aligns with the federal government’s strategic direction on Indigenous affairs.

---

**In essence**, this regulation establishes a formal, ongoing federal mechanism through which the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development can act as a trusted representative (interlocutor) for Métis and non-status Indigenous peoples, enabling the federal government to enter into meaningful, collaborative agreements with Indigenous organizations to advance shared goals in areas of social, economic, and cultural development. It represents a significant policy development in the federal government’s approach to engaging with non-reserve and Métis communities.
