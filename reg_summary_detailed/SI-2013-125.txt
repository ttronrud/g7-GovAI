**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Ts’ude niline Tu’eyeta [Ramparts River and Wetlands]) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in the Northwest Territories from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer)** because these lands may be required as a **candidate protected area** under the **Northwest Territories Protected Areas Strategy**.

This withdrawal is directly linked to **Section 26 of the Sahtu Dene and Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement (SDMCLCA)**, which recognizes the importance of protecting culturally and ecologically significant lands, particularly those related to the traditional territories of the Sahtu Dene and Métis peoples.

---

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**

The Order withdraws two distinct sets of land tracts from disposal:

#### **1. Surface and Subsurface Rights – Schedule 1 Tracts**  
- Includes **all surface and subsurface rights** to the land described in **Schedule 1**.
- This includes a large area of approximately **14,700 km²**, defined by a detailed boundary description based on specific topographic maps (Edition 2 of map sheets 106G to 106J of the National Topographic System at 1:250,000 scale).
- The boundary runs from the **easterly boundary of the Gwich’in Settlement Area** at latitude 66°23′49″N, following a series of straight-line segments north, northeast, east, southeast, and south along the **Mackenzie River and Mountain River**, eventually returning to the starting point.
- Coordinates are referenced to the **NAD83 CSRS** (1983 North American Datum) and the **UTM projection plane**.
- The area is identified as the **Ts’ude niline Tu’eyeta**, meaning "Ramparts River and Wetlands" in the Dene language, highlighting its ecological and cultural significance.

#### **2. Subsurface Rights – Schedule 2 Tracts**  
- Includes **only subsurface rights** to specific Sahtu-specific sites listed in Schedule 2:
  - Sahtu Parcels 14 and a portion of Parcel 21
  - Sahtu Specific Sites FGH57, FGH56, FGH27, FGH55, and FGH59
- These sites are surveyed and recorded in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records (CLSR)** under specific plans (e.g., plan 81322, 79041, etc.).
- The area covered is approximately **387.47 km²**.
- The subsurface rights are withdrawn **only to the ordinary high-water mark**, which is under the administrative control of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
- All **third-party interests** in these areas that are administered by the Minister are **excluded** from this withdrawal.

> ✅ **Key Note:** This withdrawal applies to the **surface and subsurface rights** in the large area (Schedule 1), and only **subsurface rights** in the smaller, specific sites (Schedule 2).

---

### **Duration of Withdrawal**

- The withdrawal is **temporary**, lasting for a period of **two years**, beginning on the date the Order is made.
- After this period, the lands may be re-opened to disposal unless otherwise extended or modified by further legislation or agreement.

### **Exclusions – When Section 2 Does NOT Apply**

Despite the general withdrawal, the Order explicitly **excludes** certain activities involving land or mineral interests, ensuring that critical infrastructure and existing rights are not disrupted. These exclusions include:

1. **Dispositions under the Territorial Quarrying Regulations** – No restriction applies to the disposal of substances or materials (e.g., stone, sand, gravel) under this regulation.

2. **Land for Electrical Transmission Lines** – Interests in land required for:
   - Electrical transmission lines
   - Ancillary facilities for power generated at:
     - The **Talston River hydroelectric project**
     - The **Bluefish hydroelectric dam**

3. **Land under the Acquisition Agreement of May 5, 1988** – Any land listed in the agreement between:
   - Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada
   - The Government of the Northwest Territories
   - The Northern Canada Power Commission
   - The Northwest Territories Power Corporation  
   is **excluded** from this withdrawal.

4. **Mineral Claims and Licences (Specific Exclusions)** – The withdrawal does **not** apply to:
   - **Locating or recording mineral claims** that were made **before** the date of the Order.
   - **Granting of leases** to holders of recorded claims, if the lease covers an area within the claim.
   - **Issuance of significant discovery licences** (under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act) to holders of exploration licences issued **before** the Order, if the licence covers the same area.
   - **Issuance of production licences** to holders of exploration or significant discovery licences issued **before** the Order, if the production licence covers the same area.
   - **Issuance of surface leases** to holders of recorded claims or interests under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act, where the lease is required to allow the holder to exercise rights under the claim or interest.
   - **Renewal of interests** (e.g., mineral rights) that were already in place prior to the Order.

> 🔍 These exclusions ensure continuity of existing rights and infrastructure development projects, particularly those related to energy and mining, while protecting the proposed protected area.

---

### **Repeal Clause (Important Clarification)**

The regulation includes a **repeal clause** stating that:

> In the Northwest Territories, all the described land parcels (the large area and the specific Sahtu sites) are **repealed from disposal** under the Territorial Lands Act.

This means that **no future disposal (sale, lease, or transfer)** of these lands will occur during the two-year period unless otherwise authorized by law or agreement.

---

### **Key Implications and Significance**

1. **Environmental and Cultural Protection**  
   - The area is ecologically significant (wetlands, river systems) and culturally important to Indigenous communities, especially the Sahtu Dene and Métis.
   - The withdrawal supports the **Northwest Territories Protected Areas Strategy**, which aims to preserve biodiversity, water quality, and traditional land use.

2. **Indigenous Rights and Land Claims**  
   - The action is grounded in **Section 26 of the Sahtu Dene and Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement**, which affirms Indigenous rights to land and environmental protection.
   - It reflects a commitment to **co-governance and shared stewardship** of natural resources.

3. **Balancing Development and Conservation**  
   - While the land is withdrawn from disposal, **existing mining and energy projects** (e.g., hydroelectric infrastructure) are preserved, demonstrating a balanced approach to development and environmental protection.

4. **Temporary Nature**  
   - The two-year period allows time for:
     - Environmental assessments
     - Community consultation
     - Final designation of the area as a protected area
     - Further legal or policy development

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **strategic, temporary measure** to protect ecologically and culturally significant lands in the Northwest Territories — specifically the **Ramparts River and Wetlands (Ts’ude niline Tu’eyeta)** — from being sold or leased. It aligns with broader Indigenous land rights, environmental protection goals, and regional development planning. While it withdraws land from disposal, it does so with **careful exclusions** to preserve existing energy infrastructure and mineral rights established prior to the Order.

This step is a critical component in the implementation of the **Sahtu Dene and Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement** and supports the long-term sustainability and cultural integrity of the region.

📌 **Summary in One Sentence:**  
*The Government of Canada, through the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, temporarily withdraws approximately 14,700 km² of land (including key wetlands and river systems) and 387 km² of specific subsurface sites in the Northwest Territories from disposal for two years to protect them as potential protected areas under the Sahtu Dene and Métis Land Claim Agreement, while preserving existing energy infrastructure and mineral rights.*
