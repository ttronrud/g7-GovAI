### 2. **Who Is Covered?**

#### ✅ Covered Beneficiaries:
| Category | Conditions |
|--------|------------|
| **Nationals of either State** | Eligible for benefits under the other country’s system under the same conditions as nationals of that State. |
| **Family members and survivors** | Eligible to the extent their rights derive from the national’s entitlement. |
| **Refugees** | Covered under the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol, provided they reside in one of the two countries. |
| **Stateless persons** | Covered under the 1954 Convention on Statelessness, provided they reside in one of the two countries. |
| **Nationals of third countries** | Covered if they have been subject to one of the two States’ social security systems or acquired rights under it. |

> 📌 *Note*: All individuals must meet residency or insurance requirements as defined under the relevant legislation.

---

### 3. **Residency and Domicile Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Reside** (Switzerland) | Usually sojourns in the country |
| **Domicile** (Switzerland) | As defined in the Swiss Civil Code — place where a person lives and intends to establish residence |
| **Period of insurance** | Time during which contributions were made to Swiss Old Age, Survivors, or Disability Insurance, or equivalent period in Canada |

> ⚖️ *Any term not defined here takes its meaning from the applicable domestic legislation.*

---

### 4. **Reciprocal Obligations and Equal Treatment**

#### ✅ Equal Conditions for Benefits:
- **Canadian nationals** and their families are eligible for **Swiss benefits** under the **same conditions as Swiss nationals**.
- **Swiss nationals** and their families are eligible for **Canadian benefits** under the **same conditions as Canadian nationals**.

> This ensures **non-discrimination** and **equal treatment** across borders.

#### ✅ Protection Against Benefit Reduction:
- **Swiss cash benefits** (e.g., pensions, disability payments) **shall not be reduced, suspended, or cancelled** simply because the beneficiary:
  - Resides in **Canada** (for persons described in Article 3, a–c)
  - Resides in a **third country** (for persons described in Article 3, a)

- **Canadian benefits** (e.g., CPP, OAS) **shall not be reduced, suspended, or cancelled** simply because the beneficiary:
  - Resides in **Switzerland**
  - Resides in a **third country**

> This prevents **benefit erosion due to residency status**.

---

### 5. **Employment and Insurance Coverage**

#### 🔧 Employment Rules:
- A person **employed** in one of the two countries is subject **only** to the social security legislation of the **State where they are employed**.
- A **self-employed** person residing in one country is subject **only** to the legislation of the **country where they reside**.

#### 🚧 Detached Workers (Temporary Assignments):
- If an employee is **detached** by an employer to work in the other country for **up to 60 months**, they are treated as if working in the **home country** for social security purposes.
- **Extension beyond 60 months** is allowed **only if**:
  1. The competent authority in the **home country** considers the extension justified.
  2. The request is submitted to the **other country’s competent authority**.
  3. The other country **consents** to the extension.
  4. The request is made **before the end of the current detachment period**.

> This protects temporary workers from being left without coverage.

#### 🏛️ Diplomatic and Consular Staff:
- **Administrative and technical staff** of diplomatic or consular missions:
  - Are insured under the **receiving State’s legislation** if they are nationals of that State or have permanent residence there.
  - May **elect** to be insured under the **sending State’s legislation** if they are nationals of that State.

> ⚖️ *Exception*: The **Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations (1961 & 1963)** take precedence over this Convention **if they conflict** with its provisions.

### 6. **Creditable Periods and Benefit Eligibility**

#### 📅 For **Old Age Security Act (OAS)**:
- If a person is covered by the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial comprehensive pension plan during a period of residence in **Switzerland**, that period counts as **residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants (who are not covered by Swiss legislation).
- Conversely, if a person is employed in Canada and subject to Swiss legislation, that period **does not count** toward Canadian residence for eligibility purposes — **unless** the person is covered by CPP or provincial plans.

> 📌 *Totalizing Rule*: If a person is not entitled to a benefit solely on Canadian periods, eligibility is determined by **totaling**:
> - Canadian periods of residence
> - Swiss periods of residence (after the age when Canadian residence periods become creditable)

> 🔍 **After the age of eligibility**, Swiss residence periods **count as Canadian residence** for OAS purposes.

#### 📅 For **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**:
- A calendar year with **at least three months of Swiss insurance** counts as a **year of contributions** under the CPP.
- The **earnings-related portion** of the CPP pension is calculated **only on pensionable earnings under the CPP**.
- The **flat-rate portion** is calculated by:
  - Multiplying the flat-rate amount under CPP
  - By the **fraction** of contributions relative to the **minimum qualifying period** (e.g., 35 years).
  - This fraction **cannot exceed 1** (i.e., maximum benefit is capped at full amount).

> 💡 *Example*: If someone has 30 years of contributions, the flat-rate portion would be 30/35 = 85.7% of the full flat-rate.

#### 📉 **Minimum Period Requirement**:
- If the **total creditable periods under Canadian legislation are less than one year**, the Canadian institution **is not required** to pay benefits.

> This prevents very short-term residents from receiving benefits.

#### 📌 Special Case – Totalizing via Third Countries:
- If a person is entitled to a benefit under **a third country’s social security system** (with which both Canada and Switzerland have an international agreement), and the total creditable periods are less than one year, **benefits are not payable** under Canada’s system.

> This ensures consistency across international agreements.

### 7. **Disability Benefits and Rehabilitation**

#### ✅ Canadian Nationals in Switzerland:
- Can claim **Swiss disability rehabilitation measures** if:
  - They maintain **residence in Switzerland**
  - They had **contributions to Swiss Old Age, Survivors, or Disability Insurance** before disablement

#### 🚧 Special Rules for Children:
- **Children domiciled in Switzerland**:
  - Can claim rehabilitation if:
    - Born disabled in Switzerland
    - Or born disabled in Canada, **but mother did not stay in Canada for more than 2 months before birth**
  - A **maximum 3-month sojourn in Canada** after birth counts as **residence in Switzerland**
- **Children with congenital defects**:
  - Swiss Disability Insurance pays benefits for **3 months after birth** (as if born in Switzerland)

> 📌 *Analogy applies*: For children born outside Switzerland or Canada, benefits are granted **only
