Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Regulation Summary:**

**Title and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of *section 7(2)* of the *Financial Administration Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 24), specifically subsection 23(2), which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue) to remit (i.e., forgive or waive) interest payable by a taxpayer in certain circumstances.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **remit interest** that would otherwise be due by a taxpayer (excluding promoters) in respect of **tax liabilities arising from disallowed deductions** related to the *Overseas Credit and Guaranty Corporation (OCGC) limited partnerships*.

This action is taken **in the public interest**, as determined by the Governor General in Council, and is based on a recommendation from the Minister of National Revenue.

---

### **Scope of the Remittance**

1. **Applicable Taxpayers**:  
   - The regulation applies to **taxpayers who are not promoters** (i.e., individuals or entities who were not involved in the formation or management of the OCGC partnerships).
   - Promoters are explicitly excluded from this remittance.

2. **Time Period Covered**:  
   - The interest remittance applies to **taxation years prior to 1985**.
   - This means the regulation retroactively addresses tax years from the beginning of the Canadian tax system up to, but not including, the 1985 fiscal year.

3. **Nature of the Disallowed Deduction**:  
   - The disallowed deductions were claimed by taxpayers under the OCGC limited partnerships.
   - These deductions were **disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)**, meaning they were rejected as not being allowable under tax rules.

4. **Basis for Disallowance**:  
   - The disallowance occurred because the taxpayer **accepted the disallowed deductions in a letter** addressed to the **Chief of Appeals, Appeals Division, Ottawa Taxation Centre**.
   - The letter must be one that:
     - Was sent in response to the CRA’s assessment or disallowance of deductions;
     - Was formally accepted by the taxpayer as part of the administrative process;
     - Is either:
       - A letter included in **Revenue Canada’s May 15, 1996 Offer of Settlement to Overseas Credit and Guaranty Corporation Participants**, or
       - A letter that conforms to the terms of that Offer of Settlement or to any **relevant Minutes of Settlement**.

---

### **Legal and Procedural Framework**

- The regulation is issued under the **Financial Administration Act**, which provides the government with the power to make administrative decisions involving tax liabilities, including the forgiveness of interest.
- The **Minister of National Revenue** recommends the remittance, based on a review of the circumstances and the public interest.
- The Governor General in Council (as the formal executive authority) **approves and issues** the regulation, giving it legal force.

---

### **Key Conditions for Eligibility**

To qualify for the interest remittance, a taxpayer must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. The taxpayer is **not a promoter** of the OCGC limited partnerships.
2. The taxpayer claimed deductions related to the OCGC partnerships.
3. The deductions were **disallowed** by the CRA.
4. The taxpayer **accepted the disallowance** in a formal letter to the Chief of Appeals, Ottawa Taxation Centre.
5. The letter is either:
   - Part of the **May 15, 1996 Offer of Settlement**; or
   - Consistent with the terms of that offer or with a **relevant Minute of Settlement**.

---

### **Effect of the Remittance**

- The interest that would have been payable by the taxpayer on the disallowed deductions (for taxation years before 1985) is **forgiven or waived**.
- This effectively **reduces or eliminates** the financial burden on non-promoter taxpayers who accepted the disallowance in the context of the 1996 settlement.
- The remittance is not a refund of taxes, but rather a **remission of interest** on a past tax liability.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council finds it to be in the **public interest** to remit this interest. This may be due to:
- The complexity and historical nature of the OCGC arrangements;
- The fact that the disallowance was part of a broader administrative and settlement process;
- The potential for undue hardship on individuals or entities who were not at fault in the original deduction claims;
- The desire to resolve long-standing tax disputes in a fair and equitable manner.

---

### **Historical Context**

- The OCGC was a Canadian entity established in the 1970s to provide credit and guarantees to overseas businesses.
- In the 1980s, some Canadian taxpayers claimed deductions related to investments or loans through OCGC partnerships.
- These deductions were later disallowed by the CRA due to tax policy or compliance issues.
- The 1996 Offer of Settlement was a formal resolution to these long-standing disputes, and this regulation serves as a mechanism to implement its terms retroactively.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **targeted, retroactive remission of interest** for non-promoter taxpayers who accepted disallowed deductions related to OCGC partnerships in the pre-1985 period. It is a practical and equitable measure to resolve historical tax disputes, reduce financial penalties, and uphold fairness in the tax system—particularly in cases involving complex or outdated partnerships.

It is an example of how the Canadian tax administration can use administrative discretion under the Financial Administration Act to achieve justice and public interest outcomes in long-standing tax matters.

**Note**: This regulation is not a general rule but applies only to specific taxpayers, specific deductions, and specific time periods, as defined by the terms of the 1996 Offer of Settlement and the Minutes of Settlement.
