### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Scope of the Land Inclusion**  
   The regulation specifies that **any portion of Lot 568, Group 814**, located in the **Town of Hay River, Northwest Territories**, which lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark along the shoreline**, shall be **included in the grant of the said lands**.

   - This means that even if such a portion was previously excluded or not explicitly granted, it is now formally incorporated into the land grant due to its proximity to the shoreline.
   - The 30.48 metre (100 feet) boundary is a standard measurement used in Canadian land law to define the reach of certain land rights, particularly those related to access, use, or protection of coastal areas.

2. **Legal Basis**  
   The inclusion is authorized under **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**. This provision typically allows for the inclusion of land in a grant when it is:
   - Adjacent to a water body,
   - Relevant to public use or access,
   - Necessary to ensure the integrity or usability of a land parcel,
   - Or required for administrative or regulatory purposes.

   In this case, the inclusion is justified by the shoreline location, which may relate to access, environmental protection, or land use planning.

3. **Description of the Land**  
   - The land in question is **Lot 568, Group 814**, in the **Town of Hay River**, Northwest Territories.
   - This lot is officially recorded in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** at Ottawa, under **survey plan number 52195**.
   - A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District of Yellowknife**, under **file number 380**.

   This ensures that the legal description of the land is officially documented and accessible for record-keeping, title searches, and future legal proceedings.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- The regulation ensures that **shoreline land within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark** is legally recognized as part of the grant, which may have implications for:
  - Land use (e.g., access for fishing, recreation, or infrastructure),
  - Environmental protection,
  - Indigenous rights or customary use (if applicable),
  - Future development or administrative decisions.

- It provides **clarity and legal certainty** regarding land boundaries, especially in areas where water access or tidal zones are relevant.

- The inclusion of this shoreline area may also support **public access rights**, **conservation efforts**, or **coastal management strategies**.

### **Administrative and Record-Keeping Implications**

- The regulation is formally recorded in the **Land Titles Office**, ensuring that the updated boundary is reflected in official land records.
- The reference to the **survey plan (52195)** and the **file number (380)** ensures transparency and allows for verification by stakeholders, legal professionals, or government agencies.

The action enhances legal clarity, supports land use planning, and ensures that coastal areas are properly recognized and managed within the jurisdiction of the Northwest Territories.
