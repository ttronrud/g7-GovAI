|--------|------------------------|

### 🔹 **6. Residency and Benefit Calculation Rules (Article V)**

#### For **Old Age Security (OAS) and CPP Benefits**:

- **If a person is contributing to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or a provincial plan while residing in Israel**:  
  → That period is counted as **residence in Canada** for **the person and their spouse/dependants** who live with them and are not subject to Israeli legislation due to employment/self-employment.

- **If a person is contributing to Israeli legislation while residing in Canada**:  
  → That period is **not counted** as residence in Canada for the person or their spouse/dependants **unless** they are contributing to the CPP or provincial pension plan.

> This ensures that individuals who contribute to Canadian systems in Israel gain Canadian residency credits, while reverse contributions in Canada do not count toward Canadian residency.

#### Contribution-Based Eligibility:

- A person is considered to be "subject to" a plan only if they **make contributions** during the period due to **employment or self-employment**.

> This prevents retroactive or arbitrary inclusion of residency based on mere presence.

---

### 🔹 **7. Residency Status for Spouses and Dependents**

- A person who is subject to Israeli legislation under Articles IV–VIII (e.g., due to work) is considered **resident in Israel**.  
- This applies **to their spouse** who resides with them and is **not subject to Canadian pension plans** due to employment or self-employment.

> This helps ensure that spouses are recognized in the relevant system and can access benefits accordingly.
