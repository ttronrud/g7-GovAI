### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Oil and Gas Diving Regulations (S.C. 1986, c. 45, s. 122)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations were enacted under the **Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act** (the "Act") by the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of two federal ministers:

- The **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**
- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**

The regulations were developed following a **public consultation process**. A proposed version was published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **July 9, 1988**, providing interested parties—including industry stakeholders, safety experts, and Indigenous communities—with a reasonable opportunity to submit representations or comments.

This public input ensured that the final regulations reflect a balance between operational feasibility and stringent safety standards for diving operations in the oil and gas sector.

#### **2. Regulation Title and Scope**

- **Title:** *Canada Oil and Gas Diving Regulations*
- **Applicability:** Applies to all diving operations associated with:
  - Exploration
  - Drilling for
  - Production, conservation, processing, or transportation of oil or gas
- **Geographic Scope:** Applies in areas where the *Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act* is in force.

These regulations govern **all aspects of diving safety**, including personnel qualifications, equipment standards, operational procedures, emergency response, and environmental considerations.

#### **3. Key Definitions (Critical for Understanding the Regulations)**

The regulations define key terms to ensure clarity and consistency across operations. These definitions are essential for interpreting compliance requirements:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Accident** | A fortuitous event resulting in death or injury to a person involved in a dive. |
| **Incident** | A fortuitous event that compromises safety, endangers health, or threatens the well-being of divers. |
| **Dive** | Classified into three categories (I, II, III) based on depth, pressure, and technique. |
| **Category I Dive** | Depth <50 meters; uses air as breathing mixture; surface-oriented; no mixed gases except for emergencies. Excludes lock-out dives. |
| **Category II Dive** | Lock-out dive (<50 m with air) or ≥50 m with mixed gas (non-saturation). Excludes saturation diving. |
| **Category III Dive** | Saturation dives or any dive not falling into Category I or II. Includes long-duration dives with extended exposure to pressure. |
| **ADS (Atmospheric Diving System)** | A system that maintains internal pressure at atmospheric level, allowing divers to work at depth without pressurization. Includes one-person submarines and one-atmosphere compartments. |
| **Bell Bounce Technique** | A method using a diving bell or submersible to transport divers under atmospheric pressure to work sites and back under higher pressure. Excludes saturation diving. |
| **Bottom Time** | Time from start of descent to beginning of decompression. |
| **Dive Time** | Full duration from preparation to completion of decompression and exit from water. |
| **Total Dive Time** | From preparation to exit, with normal inert gas pressure restored in the body. |
| **Decompression Sickness (DCS)** | Condition caused by pressure changes; classified into **Type I** (joint pain, skin rash) and **Type II** (neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular symptoms). |
| **Decompression Table** | Approved schedule for safe descent, ascent, and breathing mixtures. Must be approved under section 5. |
| **Diver** | Person meeting medical, training, and competency standards (section 53, 55, or 57). |
| **Supervisor** | Person appointed in writing to oversee a dive operation; must meet specific qualification criteria depending on dive category. |
| **Life-Support System** | Equipment providing breathing mixtures, decompression/recompression, environmental control, and emergency support. |
| **Hyperbaric First-Aid Technician** | Trained to provide emergency care under pressure. |
| **Life-Support Technician** | Trained in operation of all life-support systems and emergency procedures. |
| **Diving Safety Specialist** | Qualified professional who provides ongoing safety advice and oversight. |
| **Specialized Diving Doctor** | Medical doctor certified to provide medical assistance under pressure (beyond standard diving doctors). |
| **Stand-by Diver** | Trained and equipped to assist a primary diver immediately if needed. |
| **Environmental Conditions** | Includes weather, currents, temperature, shipping, icing, and debris. |

#### **4. Core Regulatory Requirements**

##### **4.1 Authorization Process**
- Operators must apply for authorization under **paragraph 3.2(1)(b)** of the Act.
- Applications must be submitted in **triplicate**, in a form prescribed by the Minister.
- Authorization is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions.

##### **4.2 Performance Standards**
- The operator and any diving contractor must maintain the **level of performance** (in terms of crew competence, equipment reliability, and craft safety) **at or above** the level specified in the original application and accepted by the Minister.
- This ensures that operational standards do not degrade over time.

##### **4.3 Supervisor Qualification Requirements**
- Any proposed **replacement or addition** of a supervisor must be accompanied by evidence that the new supervisor:
  - Meets the criteria in **sections 27, 29, 31, or 33** (depending on dive category),
  - Is qualified to supervise the specific type of dive (e.g., Category I vs. III).
- Supervisors must be formally appointed in writing.

##### **4.4 Environmental Condition Thresholds**
- If environmental conditions (e.g., wind, waves, ice, currents) in a given area become **more severe** than those indicated in the original application, the diving program must be **halted** in that area during the period of increased risk.
- This protects personnel from unforeseen hazards.

##### **4.5 Mandatory Safety Consultations and Oversight**
An authorization cannot be granted unless the applicant provides evidence that:

1. **Diving Safety Specialist Consultation:**
   - A diving safety specialist has been consulted on **all safety aspects** of the proposed diving program.

2. **24-Hour Availability:**
   - The diving safety specialist must be available **24 hours a day** to advise:
     - Any person involved in the program
     - Decision-makers regarding safety issues

3. **Supervisor Competency:**
   - All supervisors involved must meet the qualification criteria for their assigned dive category.

4. **Availability of Specialized Diving Doctor:**
   - A **specialized diving doctor** (trained to assist under pressure) must be available:
     - Familiar with the diving procedures used
     - Within a **traveling distance acceptable to the Minister**
     - Available to provide medical assistance when required

> *Note: The text appears to be cut off at the end of this requirement. However, based on context, it likely continues with additional requirements such as emergency plans, training, and equipment certification.*

#### **5. Personnel and Training Requirements**

| Role | Qualification Requirements |
|------|----------------------------|

| **Supervisor** | Must have formal appointment; must meet competency standards based on dive category (I, II, III). |
| **Life-Support Technician** | Completed course acceptable to the Minister; proven competence in all diving techniques, emergency procedures, hyperbaric first-aid, and operation of life-support systems. |
| **Hyperbaric First-Aid Technician** | Completed advanced course acceptable to the Minister. |
