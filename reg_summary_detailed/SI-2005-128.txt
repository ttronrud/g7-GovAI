**Detailed Summary of the McIntyre Lands Income Tax Remission Order (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *McIntyre Lands Income Tax Remission Order* is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (specifically subsection 23(2)a), by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians. This Order provides a **tax remission** for certain Indigenous individuals (defined as "Indians" under the *Indian Act*) who owned or held interests in specific tracts of land known as the **McIntyre Lands** in Whitehorse, Yukon.

The primary purpose of the Order is to **correct a historical inequity** in the taxation treatment of land held by Indigenous peoples in the McIntyre area — where land was not legally classified as a reserve, despite being held under conditions similar to reserve status. The remission aims to reduce the financial burden on these individuals by refunding the excess income tax, interest, and penalties they would have otherwise paid had the land been treated as a reserve throughout the years 1999 to 2005.

### **Key Provisions and Definitions**

#### **1. Definitions**
- **"Indian"**: Has the same meaning as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*. This includes status Indians, Métis, and non-status Indians as recognized under federal law.
- **"McIntyre Lands"**: Refers to specific parcels of land in the Hillcrest McIntyre Subdivision of Whitehorse, Yukon, as precisely described in the Schedule (attached to the Order).
- **"Reserve"**: Defined as per subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*, meaning land set aside for Indigenous communities under federal jurisdiction.
- **"Yukon First Nation Final Agreement"**: A land claims agreement governed by the *Yukon First Nations Land Claims Settlement Act*. If an individual is enrolled in such an agreement for the entire taxation year, the remission **does not apply** to them.

> This exclusion ensures that individuals who are part of formal land claims settlements (which already provide legal and financial protections) are not subject to this remission, thereby avoiding duplication or overlap.

### **Core Provision: Tax Remission**

Under this Order, **a remission of income tax, interest, and penalties** is granted to eligible Indians for each taxation year from **1999 to 2005**, under the following condition:

> The remission equals the **excess** of:
> - The actual tax, interest, and penalties paid or payable under Parts I, I.1, and I.2 of the *Income Tax Act* for that year,
>  
> over
> - The amount of tax, interest, and penalties that **would have been payable** if the McIntyre Lands had been legally classified as a reserve for the entire year.

In simpler terms:
- If an Indian had been taxed as if the land were a reserve (which would have led to lower tax liability due to reserve tax exemptions), and they actually paid more than that, the difference is **refunded**.
- The remission is not a blanket exemption — it only applies when the individual overpaid due to the land not being treated as a reserve.

> This is a **recovery mechanism**, not a general tax relief. It targets the financial impact of the land classification issue.

---

### **Scope and Application**

#### **Applicability Conditions**
- Applies to **Indians** (as defined in the *Indian Act*).
- Applies to **taxation years from 1999 to 2005**.
- **Does not apply** to any Indian who is enrolled **throughout** a given year under a *Yukon First Nation Final Agreement*.

> This ensures that individuals who are already protected under land claims agreements (which may include full land rights, tax exemptions, or other benefits) are not double-reimbursed or exposed to overlapping benefits.

### **Description of the McIntyre Lands (Schedule)**

The Order identifies five distinct parcels of land in the **Hillcrest McIntyre Subdivision**, Whitehorse, Yukon, using survey plan references. These parcels are described in detail as follows:

---

#### **FIRSTLY**
- **Lots 567 to 669 inclusive**  
  Located in the Hillcrest McIntyre Subdivision, Whitehorse, Yukon.  
  Survey Plan: Record No. 66606 (Canada Lands Surveys Records, Ottawa)  
  Copy filed in Land Titles Office, Yukon Land Registration District, Whitehorse — File No. 58624

---

#### **SECONDLY**
- **Lots 791 to 901 inclusive**  
  Same subdivision and location.  
  Survey Plan: Record No. 66607  
  Copy filed — File No. 58625

---

#### **THIRDLY**
- **Lots 710 to 735 inclusive**, **748 to 762 inclusive**, **766 to 790 inclusive**, and **Lot 741**  
  Also in Hillcrest McIntyre Subdivision.  
  Survey Plan: Record No. 66607

---

> These parcels collectively form the **McIntyre Lands**, which were historically held by individuals but were not officially designated as reserves under the *Indian Act*. As a result, they were subject to regular income taxation, unlike land held in a reserve, which is generally exempt from income tax.

---

### **Legal and Policy Rationale**

1. **Historical Injustice**: The land was not formally recognized as a reserve, even though it was held under conditions similar to reserve status (e.g., under Indigenous ownership, community use, or cultural significance). This led to higher tax liabilities for Indigenous individuals.

2. **Equity and Fairness**: The remission corrects this imbalance by refunding the tax overpayments that resulted from the lack of reserve status.

3. **Federal Responsibility**: The Order reflects the federal government’s recognition of the need to address historical inequities in land rights and taxation for Indigenous peoples.

4. **Limited Scope**: The Order is narrowly tailored to specific years (1999–2005), specific land parcels, and specific individuals, ensuring precision and accountability.

### **Implementation and Practical Implications**

- **Eligibility**: Only individuals who:
  - Were enrolled as "Indians" under the *Indian Act*,
  - Owned or held interest in one of the listed parcels,
  - Were not enrolled under a Yukon First Nation Final Agreement for the full year,
  - Had tax liabilities during 1999–2005,
  - Overpaid tax due to the non-reserve status of the land,

  are eligible for remission.

- **Remission Process**:
  - The amount of remission is calculated based on the difference between:
    - Actual tax paid,
    - Hypothetical tax if the land had been a reserve.
  - The remitted amount is typically processed through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) as a refund or adjustment.

- **No Retroactive Tax Exemption**: The remission is not a general exemption from future taxes. It is a **one-time correction** for past years only.

### **Conclusion**

The *McIntyre Lands Income Tax Remission Order* is a targeted, equitable, and legally sound measure designed to **rectify a historical tax inequity** faced by Indigenous individuals in the Whitehorse area. By recognizing the McIntyre Lands as having reserve-like characteristics and remitting the tax overpayments from 1999 to 2005, the Order:

- Acknowledges the importance of land status in determining tax obligations,
- Promotes fairness in the application of income tax laws to Indigenous peoples,
- Respects existing land claims agreements through clear exclusions,
- And reinforces the federal government’s commitment to reconciliation and justice in Indigenous affairs.

This Order stands as a significant example of how federal policy can be used to correct past injustices in taxation and land rights, particularly in the context of Indigenous self-determination and land-based identity.
