**Detailed Summary of the C.O.T.C. Pension Regulations (1961)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation (C.O.T.C.) Pension Regulations*, made under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* and Vote 520 of the *Appropriation Act No. 5, 1961*, govern the transition of pension rights for employees of the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation (C.O.T.C.) from pre-existing pension plans (the *Standard Life Plan* and the *United Kingdom Plan*) to the national *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA) system.

These regulations came into effect on **November 1, 1961**, and were designed to ensure a fair and orderly transfer of pension entitlements from private or legacy pension schemes to the federal public service pension system, while providing transitional provisions for employees and the Corporation.

The regulations are formally cited as the **C.O.T.C. Pension Regulations**.

## **Core Provisions**

### **1. Election to Opt-Out of Public Service Superannuation (PSSA)**

- **Right to Opt-Out**:  
  Any employee of the C.O.T.C. who is a member of either the *Standard Life Plan* or the *United Kingdom Plan* may **choose not to become a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act**.

- **Deadline for Opt-Out**:  
  The employee must notify the **Minister of Finance in writing on or before January 1, 1962**.

- **Effect of Opt-Out**:  
  If the employee makes this election, they will **not be required to contribute** to the Public Service Superannuation system.

---

### **2. Revocation of Opt-Out Election**

- Employees who initially opted out may **revoke their decision** by submitting a written notice to the Minister of Finance **on or before October 1, 1964**.

- **Effect of Revocation**:
  - The opt-out election is **automatically revoked as of October 1, 1964**.
  - The employee **becomes a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act effective October 1, 1964**.

> **Note**: This provides a 12-year window (Jan 1, 1962 – Oct 1, 1964) during which employees could choose to return to the PSSA system.

---

### **3. Adjustment of Key Dates in the Regulations**

In the event an employee revokes their opt-out, the following key dates in the regulations are **adjusted**:

| Original Date | Revised Date |
|--------------|--------------|
| November 1, 1961 (in section 4) | **September 30, 1964** |
| November 1, 1961 (in section 6) | **October 1, 1964** |
| November 1, 1961 (in section 10, prior to paragraph (a)) | **October 1, 1964** |

This adjustment ensures that the transition timeline aligns with the revocation date, rather than the original November 1, 1961, effective date.
