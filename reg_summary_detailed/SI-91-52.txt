**Key Details and Implications:**

1. **Purpose of the Convention:**  
   The primary objective of the Convention is to prevent double taxation and fiscal avoidance of income and capital gains taxes for individuals and entities engaged in cross-border activities between Canada and Poland. It establishes rules for determining which country has the right to tax specific types of income and capital gains, and provides mechanisms for tax credits or exemptions where applicable.

2. **Entry into Force:**  
   The Convention was signed between Canada and the Polish People’s Republic (the predecessor state to the modern Republic of Poland) and officially entered into force on **November 30, 1989**. This date marks the beginning of the legal application of the treaty in both jurisdictions.

3. **Legal Authority:**  
   The notice is issued under Section 12 of the *Canada-Poland Income Tax Convention Act, 1989*, which authorizes the Canadian government to publish formal notices confirming the entry into force of income tax treaties with foreign countries. This ensures transparency and provides clarity to taxpayers, tax authorities, and legal entities operating in both jurisdictions.

4. **Relevance to Taxpayers and Tax Authorities:**  
   - Canadian residents or non-residents with income derived from Poland (e.g., employment, business profits, interest, dividends, capital gains) are now governed by the terms of the Convention.  
   - Polish residents or non-residents with income derived in Canada may also benefit from the treaty’s provisions.  
   - The Convention helps resolve disputes over tax liability by establishing clear rules on tax residency, source of income, and the application of tax credits or exemptions.

5. **Historical Context:**  
   The signing of the Convention in 1989 occurred during a period of significant political change in Eastern Europe, including the collapse of communist regimes. The treaty was a step toward normalizing international tax relations between Canada and Poland, which had previously been under a different political and economic structure. The fact that the Convention entered into force shortly after the end of the Polish People’s Republic underscores its importance in establishing a modern, cooperative tax framework.

6. **Subsequent Developments:**  
   While this notice confirms the entry into force of the original 1989 Convention, it is important to note that the current version of the treaty between Canada and the **Republic of Poland** (post-1989) may have undergone amendments or updates over time. The original treaty remains in force and is still referenced in Canadian tax law, though it may be supplemented or revised through later agreements.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulatory notice serves as a formal, legally binding announcement that the Canada-Poland Income Tax Convention, designed to prevent double taxation and promote fair tax treatment of cross-border income and capital, has become effective. It enables Canadian and Polish taxpayers to rely on the treaty’s provisions when determining tax obligations, and it strengthens bilateral tax cooperation between the two countries. The notice is a key document in Canada’s international tax framework and reflects the country’s commitment to international tax harmonization.

**Note:** The reference to the "Polish People’s Republic" in the notice is historical and reflects the official name at the time of signing. The treaty is now administered under the current diplomatic relationship between Canada and the Republic of Poland.
