#### **3. Determination of Vessel Construction Date**

For regulatory purposes, the date of construction of a vessel is considered to be the **earliest** of the following:

1. The day the keel is laid  
2. The day construction begins for a specific vessel  
3. The day assembly reaches the lesser of:  
   - 50 tonnes, or  
   - 1% of the estimated total mass of all structural materials  

This rule ensures that vessels are assessed for compliance based on when construction actually commenced, regardless of when the keel was laid.

---

#### **4. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:

✅ **Canadian vessels** operating **anywhere in the world** if they:

- Are engaged on an **international voyage** (i.e., between two foreign ports), **or**
- Are **cargo vessels** or **passenger vessels** (defined above)

❌ **Exemptions**:

- **Pleasure craft** (e.g., private yachts, recreational boats)  
- **Government vessels** (e.g., naval or emergency service vessels operated by federal or provincial governments)

> *Note: Exemptions are narrow and ensure that only vessels involved in commercial or international transport are subject to mandatory LRIT requirements.*

---

#### **5. Responsibility of Authorized Representative**

The **authorized representative** of a vessel (such as the master or operator) is responsible for ensuring that all requirements under **sections 4 to 10** are met. This includes compliance with equipment installation, operation, and record-keeping obligations.

---

#### **6. Mandatory Installation of LRIT Equipment**

Every vessel subject to these regulations must be fitted with **LRIT equipment**.

**Exception**:
- A vessel operating **exclusively in Sea Area A1** (the most heavily monitored and secure maritime zone) may be exempt **if**:
  - It is equipped with an **Automatic Identification System (AIS)** that meets the performance standards in **section 118 of the Navigation Safety Regulations, 2020**, and
  - The AIS is operated in full compliance with those standards.

> *This exemption recognizes that AIS already provides robust tracking capabilities in the most critical maritime areas.*

---

#### **7. Required LRIT Information Transmission**

The LRIT equipment must automatically transmit the following data:

1. **Vessel Identity** (e.g., name, call sign, IMO number)  
2. **Position** (latitude and longitude)  
3. **Date and Time of Transmission**

This data is transmitted continuously or at defined intervals to enable real-time tracking and monitoring by maritime authorities.

---

#### **8. Equipment Standards and Approval**

LRIT equipment must meet the **performance standards and functional requirements** set out in:

> *Section 4 of the Revised Performance Standards and Functional Requirements for the Long-Range Identification and Tracking of Ships*,  
> Annex to **IMO Resolution MSC.263(84)**, as amended from time to time.

**Interpretation Clarifications**:
- The word **"should"** in the IMO standards is interpreted as **"shall"** (i.e., mandatory, not optional).  
- The term **"Administration"** in the IMO standards is interpreted as **"Minister of Transport"** (Canada’s equivalent).

> This ensures that Canadian standards align with international best practices and that compliance is strictly enforced.

---

#### **9. Equipment Switching Off (Exceptions)**

LRIT equipment may be switched off under two specific circumstances:

##### **(a) When Protected by International Agreements**
- If international agreements, rules, or standards require protection of navigational information (e.g., due to national security or sensitive operations), the master may disable the equipment.

##### **(b) In Exceptional Circumstances (Safety/Security Reasons)**
- The master may switch off the equipment **only** when:
  - The operation of the LRIT system is believed to compromise the **safety or security** of the vessel.
  - The decision is made for the **shortest possible duration**.

> *This provision balances operational safety with regulatory compliance.*

##### **Mandatory Actions When Switching Off**:
- The master must:
  1. **Immediately inform**:
     - A **Marine Communications and Traffic Services (MCTS) Centre** of the Canadian Coast Guard  
     - If the vessel is in international waters, the **relevant maritime authority** of the coastal state
  2. **Record the reason and duration** in the vessel’s **navigational activities and events record** (as required under section 138 of the Navigation Safety Regulations, 2020)

---

#### **10. Transmission Frequency and Temporary Suspension**

LRIT equipment must be capable of:

- **Reducing transmission frequency** to **once every 24 hours**, or  
- **Temporarily stopping transmission**  

These options apply in the following situations:

- While the vessel is **undergoing repairs, modifications, or conversions** in dry dock or port  
- When the vessel is **laid up** (not in active service)

> *Note: The master may act independently, but if directed by the Minister, the action must be carried out.*

##### **Mandatory Record-Keeping When Frequency is Reduced or Transmission Stopped**:
- The master must:
  1. **Immediately notify** the Canadian Coast Guard MCTS Centre and, if applicable, the foreign maritime authority  
  2. **Document in the navigational log**:
     - The period during which transmission was reduced or stopped  
     - Whether the Minister directed the action  

> This ensures transparency and accountability in cases where tracking is temporarily suspended.

---

#### **11. System Failure Notification**

If the **Canadian Coast Guard or the Minister** notifies the vessel’s master that:

- A component of the LRIT receiving system has failed, or  
- A system used to disseminate LRIT data has failed  

→ The master must **immediately record** in the navigational log:

- The **date and time** of the notification

> This helps maintain a complete audit trail of system integrity and performance.

---

#### **12. Electromagnetic Interference Protection**

LRIT equipment must be installed so that it **does not interfere with navigational equipment** (e.g., radar, GPS, sonar).  

> This is a critical safety requirement to prevent operational hazards and ensure that navigation systems remain reliable and functional.

---

#### **13. Type Approval and Certification**

The Minister of Transport has the authority to:

- Issue a **proof of type approval** or a **certificate** for LRIT equipment  
- Only if the equipment meets the **performance and functional standards** set out in the IMO Resolution MSC.263(84)

> This ensures that only compliant, tested, and safe equipment is allowed on Canadian vessels.

---

#### **14. On-Board Record Keeping Requirements**

The vessel’s master must ensure that the **proof of type approval or certificate** is carried on board in a **readily accessible** manner:

- **Proof of Type Approval**:
  - Must be either:
    - A **label securely affixed** to the equipment in a visible location, or  
    - A **document kept in a readily accessible location**
- **Certificate**:
  - Must be kept in a **readily accessible location**

> This ensures that authorities can verify compliance during inspections or audits.
