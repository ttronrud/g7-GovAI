**Detailed Summary of the "Imported Spirits for Blending Remission Order"**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
This regulation, officially titled the *Imported Spirits for Blending Remission Order*, is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act**. It was enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of key federal departments:  
- The **Minister of National Revenue**  
- The **Minister of Finance**  
- The **Treasury Board**

The primary objective of this order is to **promote efficiency and economic benefit in the Canadian spirits industry** by providing a **remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of additional customs duty** on certain imported goods used in the blending process at Canadian distilleries.

This remission is considered to be in the **public interest**, particularly in supporting domestic production and reducing unnecessary costs for manufacturers engaged in blending operations.

### **2. Legal Authority**
The Order is made under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council to issue regulations for the administration of federal financial matters, including customs and excise duties. This provides the legal foundation for the remission of duties under specific conditions.

### **3. Scope of the Remission**

#### **Applicable Goods**
The remission applies to:
- **Spirits**
- **Wine**
- **Flavouring materials having a spirit content**

These goods must be:
- **Imported into Canada after June 30, 1982**
- **Intended solely for blending** in a **Canadian distillery** with **spirits that are already in bond**

> *Note:* "In bond" means the spirits are held under customs supervision (i.e., in a bonded warehouse) and are not yet released for sale or consumption.

#### **Duty Being Remitted**
The remission specifically covers the **additional customs duty** imposed under **Section 20 of the Customs Tariff**. This duty typically arises when goods are imported and subject to specific tariff rates that exceed standard duties, especially in cases involving blending or processing.

To qualify for the remission, a claimant must meet **all of the following conditions**:

   - Import date and origin

3. **Verification by an Excise Officer**  
   The amount of spirits, wine, or flavouring materials being claimed must be **verified by an Excise Officer**. This verification confirms that the quantity claimed matches the actual amount imported into Canada by the claimant. This step ensures accuracy and prevents fraud or overclaiming.
