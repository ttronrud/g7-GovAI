### **Definition of "Document"**  
In this Order, the term *document* includes the following:

1. **Passport** – as defined in Section 2 of the *Canadian Passport Order*;  
2. **Certificate of Citizenship** – as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Citizenship Act*;  
3. **Travel Document issued to a permanent resident** – under subsection 31(3) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*;  
4. **Permanent Resident Card** – issued under subsection 53(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations*;  
5. **Emergency Travel Document**.

This means the remission applies to a range of identity and travel documents commonly used by Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and eligible individuals.

### **Scope of Fee Remission**  
The regulation provides for the **remission (i.e., full waiver or cancellation)** of fees associated with the issuance of the above documents, specifically where the fees were paid or payable under the following provisions:

- **Paragraphs 7(c), 9(a), and (b)** and **Items 10 and 14** of the *Schedule to the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations*;  
- **Section 4 of the Consular Services Fees Regulations**;  
- **Item 6 of the Schedule to the Citizenship Regulations**;  
- **Section 315 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations**.

These fees typically cover costs related to:
- Issuance of new passports or travel documents;
- Replacement of lost, damaged, or destroyed documents;
- Citizenship-related services (e.g., certificate of citizenship).

### **Conditions for Remission**  
To qualify for the remission, the individual must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Residence or Presence in an Affected Area**  
   The person must have been **in or had their residence in an area affected by the Port of Beirut explosions** at some point during the period from **August 13, 2020, to January 31, 2021**.

   > *Note:* This period corresponds to the time of the major explosion at the Port of Beirut, Lebanon, which occurred on August 4, 2020, and caused widespread destruction, displacement, and loss of personal belongings, including identity documents.

2. **Loss, Damage, Destruction, or Inaccessibility of Document**  
   The document issued to the person must have been:
   - **Lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible** as a direct result of the Port of Beirut explosions.

   This includes physical damage to the document (e.g., torn, burned, or water-damaged) or situations where the document could not be accessed due to the explosion’s impact.

3. **Application for a Replacement Document**  
   During the period from **August 13, 2020, to January 31, 2021**, the person (or someone acting on their behalf) must have submitted a **formal application** to replace the lost, damaged, or destroyed document.  
   - The new document must bear the **same expiry date** as the original document, if applicable.  
   - This ensures consistency in the validity period of the replacement document.

4. **Declaration of Cause of Loss**  
   The application must include a **written declaration** stating that the original document was lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible **as a result of the Port of Beirut explosions**.

   This declaration is essential to establish the link between the individual’s circumstances and the explosion.

5. **No Prior Remission**  
   The fees in question **must not have already been remitted** under **Section 11 of the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations**.  
   > This prevents double remission and ensures the policy is applied only once per case.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**  
The Governor General in Council has determined that it is in the **public interest** to provide this remission due to the **humanitarian impact** of the Port of Beirut explosions. Many individuals from Lebanon or with ties to the region faced:
- Loss of personal identification;
- Displacement and instability;
- Inability to travel or prove identity due to destroyed documents.

By waiving the fees for replacing identity and travel documents, the Government supports:
- The ability of affected individuals to maintain legal status and travel;
- Facilitation of reintegration into Canadian society;
- Recognition of the disproportionate impact of the disaster on vulnerable populations.

---

### **Key Implications and Considerations**

- **Eligibility is time-bound and geographically specific**: Only those affected during the specified period (Aug 13, 2020 – Jan 31, 2021) and in affected areas qualify.
- **Document type matters**: The remission applies to specific types of travel and identity documents, not general administrative fees.
- **Application requirement**: Individuals must have formally applied for a replacement document and included the required declaration.
- **No automatic remission**: The process is not automatic; it requires proof of loss due to the explosion and a valid application.
- **Policy alignment with humanitarian principles**: This reflects Canada’s commitment to supporting vulnerable individuals affected by international crises.

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation provides a targeted, compassionate, and legally grounded mechanism to relieve financial burdens on individuals whose identity and travel documents were compromised by the 2020 Port of Beirut explosion. By waiving applicable fees under specific conditions, it supports both administrative accessibility and humanitarian responsibility, ensuring that those directly affected can regain essential documentation without financial barriers. The policy is narrowly focused, time-limited, and strictly tied to documented circumstances, ensuring accountability and public interest justification.
