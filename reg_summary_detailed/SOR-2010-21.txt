Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Background and Context**
The regulation is a **provincial designation order** issued under the authority of the **Criminal Code of Canada**, specifically **section 347.1(3)a**, which allows for the designation of a province to apply the **criminal interest rate provisions** of the Criminal Code in relation to payday lending.

The key background points include:

- **Alberta has existing legislative safeguards** for payday loan recipients. These include:
  - Specific **protections for borrowers** (e.g., transparency in loan terms, fair treatment, and access to information).
  - **Cost-of-borrowing limits** under the *Payday Loans Regulation (Alta. Reg. 157/2009)*, which restricts the total cost of borrowing to prevent predatory lending practices.

- The **Lieutenant Governor in Council** (the provincial executive authority) has formally requested that the **Governor in Council** (the federal authority) designate Alberta as a jurisdiction where the **criminal interest rate provisions** of the Criminal Code apply.

This request is based on the argument that Alberta’s strong regulatory framework — including borrower protections and cost caps — justifies applying the federal criminal interest rate provisions to ensure alignment between provincial consumer protection and federal criminal standards.

#### **2. Legal Basis**
The Order is made under:
- **Section 347.1(3)a of the Criminal Code** (R.S.C., c. C-46, s. 347.1(3)a), which provides the federal government with the power to designate a province for the purposes of the criminal interest rate provisions.

This section allows the federal government to:
- Apply the **criminal penalties** for charging interest rates above a certain threshold (currently 10% per annum in Canada) **in designated provinces**.
- Apply these provisions **only in provinces that have enacted protective legislation** and have established reasonable limits on interest rates and total borrowing costs.

Thus, the designation is not a blanket application of criminal penalties but a **targeted, conditional application** tied to the existence of strong provincial consumer protection laws.

---

#### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

- **Designation of Alberta**:  
  Alberta is officially designated as a province for the purposes of **section 347.1 of the Criminal Code**. This means that:
  - Any person who charges or collects interest on a loan at a rate exceeding the legal limit (currently 10% per annum) in Alberta may be subject to **criminal penalties** under the Criminal Code.
  - The criminal interest rate provisions now apply in Alberta, even though the federal government does not directly regulate payday lending.

- **Effective Date**:  
  The Order comes into force at **12:00 a.m. Mountain Time** on the **first day on which section 17 of the Payday Loans Regulation (Alta. Reg. 157/2009) becomes in force**.

  - Section 17 of the regulation sets the **maximum total cost of borrowing** for payday loans in Alberta (e.g., limiting the total finance charge to a specific percentage of the loan amount).
  - The regulation was first enacted in 2009 and came into force on **March 1, 2010**.

  → Therefore, the Order officially came into force on **March 1, 2010**.

#### **4. Purpose and Significance**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **Consumer Protection**:  
   To ensure that borrowers in Alberta are protected from exploitative lending practices by aligning federal criminal standards with provincial regulatory safeguards.

2. **Criminal Enforcement of Interest Rate Limits**:  
   To enable federal authorities to prosecute individuals or entities that charge interest rates above the legal limit (e.g., 10% per annum) in Alberta — even if the lending is not directly regulated under federal law.

3. **Legislative Synergy**:  
   Demonstrates how **provincial consumer protection laws** can be reinforced by **federal criminal enforcement mechanisms**, creating a stronger regulatory framework for financial services.

4. **Prevention of Predatory Lending**:  
   By making interest rate violations criminally actionable, the Order deters lenders from charging excessive fees, which could otherwise trap vulnerable borrowers in cycles of debt.

#### **5. Key Notes and Implications**

- **Not a Broad Criminalization of All Lending**:  
  The criminal provisions apply only to **interest rates exceeding the 10% per annum cap** and only in the context of **loans where the borrower is in a vulnerable position** (e.g., payday loans). It does not criminalize all lending or interest charges.

- **Provincial Regulation Must Be in Place**:  
  The designation is conditional on the existence of a strong provincial regulation like the *Payday Loans Regulation*. Alberta’s 2009 regulation meets this requirement.

- **Federal Oversight with Provincial Implementation**:  
  While the federal government makes the designation, the **actual enforcement** of interest rate limits and criminal charges is carried out by provincial and municipal authorities, with potential federal involvement in prosecutions.

- **Alignment with International Standards**:  
  This move reflects Canada’s broader effort to modernize consumer financial protection, in line with international standards on responsible lending and borrower rights.

---

#### **6. Conclusion**

This Order is a significant step in strengthening **consumer financial protection in Alberta** by linking **federal criminal interest rate provisions** with **provincial regulatory frameworks**. It ensures that payday lenders in Alberta are held accountable for charging excessive interest rates, thereby safeguarding vulnerable borrowers from predatory lending practices. The Order came into force on **March 1, 2010**, and remains in effect as long as Alberta’s regulatory framework remains in place and the designation is not revoked.
