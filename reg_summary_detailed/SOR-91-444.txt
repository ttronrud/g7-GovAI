**Detailed Summary of the St. Andrews Lock Regulations (Manitoba, 1949–Present)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *St. Andrews Lock Regulations* are a set of operational and safety rules governing the use, management, and maintenance of the St. Andrews lock, dam, bridge, and associated facilities located at Lockport, Manitoba. These regulations were introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Works, under **Sections 28 and 29 of the Public Works Act**. They officially **revoke** the earlier regulations made in 1949 (P.C. 6514) and replace them with updated, more detailed provisions to ensure safe, efficient, and orderly navigation through the facility.

These regulations are formally cited as the **St. Andrews Lock Regulations** and apply exclusively to the St. Andrews lock, dam, bridge, and related infrastructure at Lockport, Manitoba.

### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity, the regulations define several key terms:

- **Approach**: The area of water within a 15-meter radius of the lock gates.
- **Lock-master**: A Department-employed officer responsible for the daily operation and management of the lock, dam, bridge, and related facilities.
- **Owner**: Refers to the owner or agent of a vessel, or the captain/master of the vessel.
- **Superintendent**: The official appointed by the Minister to oversee the lock, dam, and bridge operations.
- **Vessel**: Any floating craft used or capable of being used for transportation (e.g., ships, boats, rafts, canoes).

### **Priority of Passage Through the Lock**

Passage order is strictly regulated to ensure safety and efficiency:

1. **Government vessels** (e.g., emergency, patrol, or official service vessels)
2. **Passenger vessels and excursion boats**
3. **Freight-carrying vessels and pleasure boats**

> **Exception**: If a vessel with higher priority (e.g., government or passenger vessel) is within a short distance of the lock and would be delayed if another vessel passed first, the lock will be held **for the vessel with precedence**.
