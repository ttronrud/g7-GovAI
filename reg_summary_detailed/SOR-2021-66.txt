**Detailed Summary of the CUKTCA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations** were issued by **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)).

This provision grants the federal government the authority to establish specific rules of origin for certain types of goods, particularly in the context of trade agreements such as the **Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement (CUKTCA)**.

The regulations are part of the broader framework established by the **Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**, which was enacted to ensure continuity of trade preferences following the UK’s departure from the European Union and to maintain stable trade relations between Canada and the UK.

### **2. Definition of "Casual Goods"**

The term **"casual goods"** is defined in these regulations as:

> *Goods other than goods imported for sale or for an industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or other like use.*

This means that casual goods are **not intended for resale or for use in business operations**. Instead, they are typically goods that are:

- Acquired for personal use,
- Used in a non-commercial context,
- Or brought into Canada for private consumption or temporary use.

Examples might include personal items, gifts, or goods used in domestic settings (e.g., household items, clothing, or equipment for personal hobbies), as opposed to goods that are purchased to be sold or used in manufacturing or service delivery.

### **3. Origin Determination for Casual Goods**

A key feature of these regulations is the **automatic origin attribution** for casual goods acquired in a **CUKTCA beneficiary country** (i.e., a country that is a party to the CUKTCA and benefits from the agreement).

Specifically:

> **Casual goods that are acquired in a CUKTCA beneficiary country are considered to originate in that country**, and thus are entitled to the benefit of the **United Kingdom Tariff** under **paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff**, **regardless of whether they would otherwise qualify** under the CUKTCA Tariff Preference Regulations.

This means that even if the goods do not meet the usual rules of origin (such as sufficient value-added content or production thresholds), they can still be treated as originating in the beneficiary country — provided the conditions below are met.

### **4. Conditions for Origin Attribution**

The origin of casual goods is determined based on **two conditions** related to **marking**:

#### **Condition 1: Marking Compliance**
The goods must be **marked in accordance with the marking laws of the CUKTCA beneficiary country**, and the marking must **indicate** that:
- The goods are the product of a **CUKTCA beneficiary country**, or
- The goods are the product of **Canada**.

This ensures that the origin is clearly communicated and legally verifiable.

#### **Condition 2: Absence of Marking or Misleading Indication**
If the goods **do not bear any mark**, and **nothing on the goods indicates** that they are:
- Not the product of a CUKTCA beneficiary country, **nor**
- Not the product of Canada,

then they are **still considered to originate in the CUKTCA beneficiary country**.

This provision protects the integrity of the origin rule by preventing fraud or misrepresentation — even in the absence of visible labeling — as long as the goods are reasonably presumed to originate from a CUKTCA beneficiary.

### **5. Effective Date and Registration Timeline**

The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 37 of the Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement Implementation Act** (chapter 1 of the Statutes of Canada, 2021) comes into force.

- **Section 37** establishes the legal framework for the implementation of the CUKTCA, including the rules of origin and tariff treatment.
- As of **April 1, 2021**, this section came into force, and thus the regulations were effective from that date.

However, if the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after April 1, 2021**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

This ensures that the rules are implemented in a timely and transparent manner, allowing for administrative processing and public notice.

---

### **6. Practical Implications**

- **Simplifies origin determination** for personal or non-commercial goods, reducing the need for complex compliance procedures.
- **Supports trade continuity** between Canada and the UK by ensuring that casual goods (such as personal items or gifts) from UK-based businesses or individuals can still qualify for tariff benefits under the CUKTCA.
- Provides **clarity and consistency** in the treatment of goods that are not subject to commercial use or resale.
- Reduces administrative burden on importers and customs officials by eliminating the need to assess value addition or production thresholds for casual goods.

### **7. Reference and Enforcement**

- **Regulation Reference**: CUKTCA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations (S.I. 2021-14)
- **In Force Date**: April 1, 2021 (initially), effective upon registration thereafter.
- **Applicable to**: Goods imported into Canada that are casual goods and acquired in a CUKTCA beneficiary country.

---

### **Conclusion**

These regulations establish a **simplified and accessible rule of origin** for casual goods — those not intended for commercial use — imported from CUKTCA beneficiary countries. By focusing on **marking compliance** or the **absence of misleading information**, the rules ensure that such goods are treated as originating in the beneficiary country and are eligible for the **UK tariff benefits** under paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff.

This provision supports **fair trade practices**, enhances **trade certainty**, and aligns with the **practical realities of personal and non-commercial imports**, particularly in the context of post-Brexit trade continuity between Canada and the UK.

> **Note**: These rules are part of a broader set of measures under the CUKTCA to ensure stable and predictable tariff treatment between Canada and the UK, especially in light of the UK’s departure from the EU.
