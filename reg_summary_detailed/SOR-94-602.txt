### **Detailed Summary of the Debt Write-off Regulations, 1994**

The **Debt Write-off Regulations, 1994** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 50, Sch. II, item 8; SOR/85-257, 1985 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 1597) are a set of administrative rules established by the **Treasury Board of Canada** under **subsection 25(1)** of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. These regulations formally **revoke the previous Debt Write-off Regulations from 1985** and replace them with a more comprehensive, transparent, and accountable framework for the writing off of debts or obligations due to Her Majesty in Right of Canada (the Crown).

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish clear, consistent, and accountable procedures** for when and how debts owed to the Crown (i.e., the Government of Canada) may be written off. This includes both general debts and specific obligations arising from government operations.

### **Key Definitions**
- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Financial Administration Act*.
- **"Debt"**: Means any debt or obligation due to Her Majesty or a claim by Her Majesty.
- **"In writing"**: Includes any electronic form that can be reproduced in intelligible, written form within a reasonable time — ensuring digital records are treated as valid documentation.

---

## **2. Exclusions – What These Regulations Do NOT Cover**

These regulations do **not apply** to the following situations:

1. **Dispute resolution** over the amount of a debt (e.g., determining how much is actually owed).
2. **Negotiation or settlement processes** between the Crown and a debtor.
3. **Debts owed to Crown corporations** (e.g., entities like Canada Post or Natural Resources Canada), which are governed by separate rules.

> This ensures that the write-off process remains focused on *accountable financial decisions*, not on legal or administrative disputes about the validity or amount of the debt.

---

## **3. Authority to Write Off Debts**

The **appropriate Minister** of a federal department — or an officer authorized in writing by that Minister — has the authority to write off a debt or part of a debt under certain conditions.

### **Conditions for Write-Off (Under Subsections 4(1) and (4)(2))**

#### **(a) Uncollectible Debt (Section 4(1))**
A debt may be written off if it is determined to be **uncollectible**, meaning:
- Further administrative expenses or collection costs are **not justifiable** relative to the debt amount and probability of recovery.

#### **(b) No Justifiable Collection Costs (Section 4(2))**
A debt may be written off if the cost of collecting it exceeds its value, or if collection is not feasible due to low likelihood of recovery.

#### **(c) Balance After Settlement (Section 4(3))**
A debt may be written off if:
- A **future debt** or **non-due debt** has a balance remaining after the present value of the debt is accepted as full settlement.
- A **compromise settlement** has been reached under applicable authority (e.g., through a formal agreement).

> These provisions allow flexibility in accounting for debts that are settled or partially settled, especially when full recovery is not possible.

---

## **4. Prohibited Write-Offs**

Certain types of debts **cannot be written off** without specific approvals or exceptions:

- **Accruals from overpayments** of salaries, wages, or employment-related allowances:
  - **No write-off allowed** without **Treasury Board approval**.
  - This protects against misuse of funds related to employee compensation.

- **Debts discovered after employment ends**:
  - **Not eligible** for write-off if the employee’s termination benefits have already been fully paid.

> These safeguards ensure that financial accountability is maintained in human resource and payroll matters.

---

## **5. Conditions for Writing Off a Debt (Mandatory Criteria)**

Before a debt may be written off under **subsection 4(1)**, **all of the following must be satisfied**:

| Condition | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **All reasonable collection efforts exhausted** | The department must have tried all possible methods of collection (e.g., letters, legal action, negotiations). |
| **No future set-off possible** | The debt cannot be offset against another claim in the future. |
| **Debtor is not resident in Canada** | And has no known assets, family, or business in Canada that might lead them to return. |
| **Debtor cannot be located** | Despite reasonable efforts, the debtor is untraceable. |
| **Evidence of debt lost or destroyed** | And the debtor denies the debt exists. |
| **Legal proceedings are statute-barred** | Or the debt is otherwise legally unenforceable. |
| **Debtor refuses to pay** | With no alternative enforcement options. |
| **Debtor is a corporation that is inoperative and has no assets** | No business operations or property. |
| **Debtor is an undischarged bankrupt corporation** | And the trustee has been discharged or confirmed in writing that no future payments are expected. |
| **Debtor is an undischarged bankrupt individual** | And the trustee has been discharged or confirmed that no future payments are expected. |
| **Debtor is deceased with no known estate** | No assets or heirs to pursue. |
| **Debtor is incapable of repaying** | Based on income levels below the threshold required to make debt payments (as per Superintendent of Bankruptcy guidelines). |
| **Debtor not reasonably expected to repay** | In the foreseeable future. |
| **No mortgageable property or financial assets** | No real or personal property, no land purchases under the Veterans’ Land Act, and no financial assets to apply toward repayment. |

> This detailed checklist ensures that write-offs are only made when there is **no realistic chance of recovery**, and all avenues have been explored.

---

## **6. Debt Control and Accountability**

- All debts must be **recorded and controlled within the department’s accounts** until either:
  - The debt is collected, or
  - It is formally written off.

> This maintains transparency and ensures that financial records remain accurate and auditable.

---

## **7. Review Process for Write-Offs**

To prevent abuse and ensure accountability, each department must establish a **formal review process** for write-offs — both full and partial.

### **Threshold for Review Committee Involvement**
- If a proposed write-off exceeds **$25,000**, or a lower amount fixed by the Minister or deputy head, it must be referred to a **review committee**.

### **Composition of the Review Committee**
- Must consist of **at least three public officers**.
- **At least one officer must not have been involved** in:
  - The creation of the debt, or
  - Any collection actions taken.

> This promotes independence and reduces conflicts of interest.

### **Committee Responsibilities**
- Evaluate the proposal.
- Provide **written recommendations** to the appropriate Minister or authorized officer.

> This adds a layer of oversight and checks against arbitrary or biased decisions.

---

## **8. Record Retention Requirements**

All records related to a written-off debt must be retained until:

1. **All audit procedures are completed**, and
2. **All administrative requirements are satisfied** regarding the debt and its write-off.

**Additional retention requirement for debts under subsection 4(1)**:
- There is **no longer any probability of future set-off**, and
- The **limitation period** for initiating legal action to recover the debt has **expired**.

> This ensures long-term accountability and compliance with audit and legal standards.

---

## **9. Legal and Policy Implications**

### **Accountability and Transparency**
- The regulations emphasize **procedural fairness**, **independence**, and **minimization of risk** in write-offs.
- They prevent departments from writing off debts arbitrarily or without due process.

### **Compliance with Financial Administration Act**
- The rules are aligned with **subsection 25(2)** of the FAA, which limits the power of ministers to write off debts without proper justification or oversight.

### **Protection of Government Interests**
- By requiring exhaustive collection efforts and independent review, the regulations protect the Crown’s interest in recovering what it is owed.
