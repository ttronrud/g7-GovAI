### **Purpose of the Order**  
This regulation establishes a **customs duty remission** for specific goods imported from **Albania** and the **Sultanate of Oman**. The remission applies to the **excess customs duties** paid or payable under the **General Tariff** that are higher than the duties applicable under the **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Tariff**.

In essence, it allows importers to recover the difference in duty between the higher General Tariff rate and the lower MFN rate for goods originating from these two countries.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Scope of Remission**  
   - Remission is granted for the **difference in customs duties** between:
     - The **General Tariff rate** (higher rate), and  
     - The **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Tariff rate** (lower rate),  
   - Applied to goods imported from **Albania** and the **Sultanate of Oman**.

2. **Time Periods for Eligibility**  
   - **Goods from Albania**: Must have been imported into Canada during the period **from September 8, 2000, to March 14, 2001**.  
   - **Goods from the Sultanate of Oman**: Must have been imported into Canada during the period **from November 9, 2000, to March 14, 2001**.  
   *(Note: The overlap in the import periods reflects different timelines of eligibility, likely due to trade agreements or administrative considerations.)*

3. **Conditions for Claiming Remission**  
   A claim for remission must meet **all of the following conditions**:
   - A claim must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the Order comes into force.  
   - No prior **refund or drawback** under the *Customs Act* or *Customs Tariff* has been granted for the same goods.  
     *(This ensures that the remission is not double-claimed or used in conjunction with other forms of duty relief.)*

4. **Effective Date**  
   The Order comes into force on the **date of registration** with the appropriate government authority (typically the day it is published in the Canada Gazette or officially registered).

### **Legal and Administrative Framework**  
- The regulation is enacted under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**, which authorizes the government to make remission orders for specific circumstances, such as where duties paid exceed those under MFN rates due to non-recipient status or special trade arrangements.  
- The Minister of Finance recommends the order, indicating that it is a policy decision based on trade considerations, potentially to support Canadian trade relationships or to address historical tariff disparities.

---

### **Implications and Significance**  
- This remission helps **reduce the financial burden** on Canadian importers who brought goods from Albania and Oman during a specific window, particularly when those goods were subject to higher general tariffs than the MFN rate.  
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to **fair trade practices**, especially in relation to countries with developing or less-developed trade relationships.  
- The two-year deadline for claiming ensures timely administration and reduces the risk of prolonged or unmonitored claims.  
- The exclusion of prior refunds or drawbacks prevents overlap and ensures fiscal accountability.

### **Conclusion**  
The *Albania and the Sultanate of Oman Goods Remission Order* (S.C. 1997, c. 36) is a targeted, time-limited relief measure that allows importers to recover excess customs duties paid on goods from Albania and Oman during specified periods (2000–2001). It operates under strict eligibility conditions, including import dates, claim timing, and no prior duty relief, ensuring fiscal responsibility and clarity in the application process. The Order is a practical tool to correct tariff disparities and support equitable trade practices within Canada’s customs framework.
