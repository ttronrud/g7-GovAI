**Detailed Summary of the Prescribed Group of Consumers Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Prescribed Group of Consumers Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 1021(1)a of the Insurance Companies Act**. This provision grants the government the authority to designate specific groups of consumers for regulatory treatment, particularly in the context of consumer protection and insurance oversight.

The regulation is formally referenced in:
- **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 364** (a statutory citation indicating the source of the regulatory power)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 47** (an earlier legislative framework, likely related to financial institution regulation)

---

**Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **identify and define a "prescribed group of consumers"** for the purposes of **sections 489.3 and 607.2 of the Insurance Companies Act**. These sections typically relate to:
- Consumer protection provisions (e.g., disclosure requirements, fairness in insurance practices)
- Regulatory obligations for insurers when dealing with certain classes of consumers

By prescribing a specific group of consumers, the regulation ensures that insurers apply targeted rules—such as enhanced disclosure, simplified terms, or specific safeguards—when providing insurance products to individuals and small businesses within this group.

**Definition of the Prescribed Group of Consumers**  
The regulation prescribes two distinct categories of individuals and entities that fall within the group:

1. **Any individual**  
   - All natural persons (individuals) are included in the prescribed group.  
   - This broad inclusion ensures that personal insurance products (e.g., auto, home, life) are subject to consumer protection standards when sold to individuals.

2. **Any entity (non-financial institution)** that:
   - Is engaged in a business;
   - Employs **fewer than 500 employees**; and  
   - Has a **gross annual revenue that does not exceed $50 million**.

   - **Exclusion**: The group explicitly **excludes financial institutions** (e.g., banks, credit unions, investment firms), meaning that financial institutions are not covered under this consumer protection framework.

   - **Business size threshold**: The criteria reflect a focus on **small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)**, which are often more vulnerable to complex or opaque insurance terms due to limited financial resources and expertise.

**Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on **one of two dates**, whichever is later:
1. The day that **Section 232 of the *Act to amend the law governing financial institutions and to provide for related and consequential matters*** (Chapter 6 of the Statutes of Canada, 2007) comes into force.  
2. The day on which that section is **registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).

This staggered effective date ensures that the regulations are implemented only after the enabling legislation is fully in effect, providing regulatory coherence and avoiding potential conflicts.

> **Note**: As of May 19, 2008, the regulations were in force, as confirmed by **SI/2008-58** (a Statutory Instrument issued to implement or amend regulations).

**Key Implications and Objectives**  
- **Consumer Protection**: The regulation strengthens consumer rights by ensuring that individuals and small businesses—particularly those with limited capacity to understand complex insurance terms—are protected from unfair or misleading practices.  
- **Simplified Insurance Practices**: Insurers may be required to provide clearer disclosures, simpler product terms, or more accessible customer service for members of this group.  
- **Targeted Regulation**: By focusing on SMEs and individuals, the regulation avoids over-regulating large financial institutions or major corporations, thereby balancing regulatory effectiveness with economic efficiency.  
- **Alignment with Broader Financial Regulation**: The timing of the regulation’s effective date aligns with broader reforms to financial institutions, suggesting integration within a larger regulatory modernization effort.

**Conclusion**  
The *Prescribed Group of Consumers Regulations* establish a clear, enforceable definition of a vulnerable consumer group—individuals and small non-financial businesses—subject to enhanced consumer protection standards under the Insurance Companies Act. By focusing on SMEs and individuals, the regulation promotes fairness, transparency, and accessibility in the insurance market, while respecting the distinct regulatory status of financial institutions.

These regulations are a key component of Canada’s effort to ensure that insurance products are accessible and understandable to the average consumer, especially those with limited financial or legal expertise.
