The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, SI/2011-78, s. 5]

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2011-78**, under **section 5** of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Nature of the Entry**: The repeated notation suggests that the regulation in question was previously in force but has since been formally repealed.
  
- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  - **Statutory Instrument 2011-78** is a piece of secondary legislation (a statutory instrument) passed in the year 2011.  
  - It was enacted to amend or remove certain provisions of existing laws, often to modernize, simplify, or align legislation with current policy or legal standards.

- **Section 5 of SI 2011-78**:  
  - This section specifically contains the legal provision that **repeals** the referenced regulation.  
  - The exact content of section 5 would normally be found in the full text of SI 2011-78. However, based on the repetition, it is clear that **multiple provisions or sections** were repealed under this instrument, and the specific one in question is identified by the reference to “s. 5”.

- **Legal Implication**:  
  - Any legal obligation, duty, or rule that was previously established by the repealed regulation is **no longer valid**.  
  - The repeal means that the regulation no longer applies, and any references to it in legal, administrative, or operational contexts are now obsolete.

- **Contextual Notes**:  
  - The fact that this entry is repeated five times may indicate a typographical or formatting error in the original source, or it could reflect that multiple sections or provisions were repealed under the same instrument (SI 2011-78, s. 5), though this is unusual in standard legal drafting.  
  - Without access to the full text of SI 2011-78, it is not possible to identify the **original regulation** that was repealed — only that it was repealed by that instrument.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does **not contain a detailed summary of a regulation**, but rather a **repeal notice** indicating that a regulation (or section thereof) was formally removed from legal effect by **Statutory Instrument 2011-78, section 5**. The regulation itself is no longer in force and should not be cited or applied. To understand the original content of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the original legislation or the explanatory notes accompanying SI 2011-78.

> **In short**: This entry confirms the repeal of a regulation under SI 2011-78, s. 5 — meaning the regulation is no longer valid. No further detail about its original content is available from this input.
