**Detailed Summary of the Wabush Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Wabush Airport Zoning Regulations* are a set of official government regulations established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada. These regulations were enacted to ensure the safe operation of **Wabush Airport**, located in the electoral district of Menihek, Province of Newfoundland. The regulations define spatial boundaries and elevation limits around the airport to prevent obstructions to aircraft takeoff, landing, and approach — particularly those that could pose a hazard due to terrain or man-made structures.

The regulations were first proposed in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **March 22, 1986**, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit representations to the Minister of Transport. Based on that public consultation, the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, formally adopted the regulations under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.

## **Key Components of the Regulations**

### **1. Definitions**

The regulations establish precise definitions for key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Wabush Airport in the electoral district of Menihek, Newfoundland. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point used as a reference for all measurements and elevations. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway (runway 01–19), designed to ensure clear visibility during aircraft approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal imaginary plane 45 meters above the ARP elevation (or 9 meters above ground if lower), defining the upper boundary of the airport zone. |
| **Strip** | The main runway area (300 m wide, 1948.8 m long) designated for takeoff and landing on runway 01–19. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the sides of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it meets the outer surface. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: 545.9 meters above sea level.

### **2. Applicable Lands**

The regulations apply to all lands:

- Within the **outer limits** described in **Part VI of the Schedule**; and  
- Any land directly beneath portions of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond those outer limits.

These lands include public road allowances and surrounding areas adjacent to the airport.

---

### **3. Prohibitions on Structures and Obstructions**

#### **No construction or alteration permitted** where the **highest point** of any building, structure, or object exceeds:

- The **approach surface**,  
- The **outer surface**, or  
- The **transitional surface**.

This means that no new construction, expansion, or modification of existing structures can create a point that rises above any of these defined imaginary surfaces.

#### **Natural Growth Exceptions**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, bushes) exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces, the **Minister of Transport may issue a directive** requiring the owner or occupier to:

- Remove the vegetation, or  
- Trim the part that exceeds the surface elevation.

This ensures that natural features do not become hazards during flight operations.

---

### **4. Prohibition on Waste Disposal**

No owner or occupier of land subject to these regulations may:

- Use the land for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible by birds**, or  
  - **Attractive to birds**

This provision is critical to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major risk to aircraft safety during takeoff and landing.

---

### **5. Location and Description of Key Features**

#### **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**  
- Located by measuring:
  - 975.36 meters **southeasterly** along the centerline of runway 01–19 from its northern end.
  - Then 152.40 meters **southwesterly at right angles** to the runway centerline.
- This point serves as the origin for all elevation and distance measurements.

#### **Approach Surfaces (Runway 01–19)**  
- Two approach surfaces, one for each end of the runway:
  - **Runway Approach 19 (south end)**:
    - Inclined plane with a **1:50 slope** (1 meter rise per 50 meters horizontal).
    - Rises to a horizontal line **300 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**.
    - This line is located **15,000 meters horizontally** from the end of the strip.
    - The outer ends of this line are **2,400 meters** from the centerline of the runway.
  - **Runway Approach 01 (north end)**:
    - Same slope and geometry as above.
    - **Exception**: Excludes all lands within the **Province of Quebec**, as shown on Public Works Canada Plan S-1448-3.

> These surfaces are designed to provide a clear zone for pilots during final approach, ensuring unobstructed visibility and safe descent.

#### **Outer Surface**  
- A **horizontal imaginary plane**:
  - At **45 meters above the ARP elevation (545.9 m)** → **590.9 m above sea level**.
  - **Exception**: If the ground is lower than 9 meters, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- This surface defines the top boundary of the entire airport zone, beyond which no structure may rise.

#### **Strip (Runway 01–19)**  
- Dimensions:
  - **Length**: 1,948.8 meters  
  - **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the centerline of the runway)

> This is the primary area for aircraft operations.

#### **Transitional Surfaces**  
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of the strip and its approach surfaces.
- Rise until they intersect with the **outer surface**.
- These surfaces ensure a smooth, gradual transition from the runway edges to the outer boundary of the airport zone.

### **6. Boundary of Outer Limits**

The outer boundary of the regulated area is defined as a **circular arc path** starting and ending at the same point:

1. Begins where a **radius of 4,000 meters** from the ARP intersects the **extension of runway 01–19 (northern end)**.
2. Follows a **clockwise arc of radius 4,000 meters** centered at the ARP.
3. Intersects the **northerly shoreline of Little Wabush Lake–Harrie Lake**.
4. Follows the **lake shoreline westward** until it meets the **southerly extension of Bartlett Drive**.
5. Proceeds **northeasterly** along Bartlett Drive and the centerline of Matthew Avenue.
6. Turns **northwesterly** along Matthew Avenue to Hudson Drive.
7. Proceeds **northeasterly** along Hudson Drive to Fermont Highway.
8. Travels **northerly** along Fermont Highway until it reaches a radius of 4,000 meters from the ARP.
9. Returns along that radius to the starting point.

> This boundary defines the **maximum extent** of the regulated zone — beyond which structures are not restricted by these zoning rules.

## **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Flight Safety**: To prevent obstructions (natural or man-made) that could interfere with aircraft during critical phases of flight — especially approach and landing.
2. **Bird Hazard Mitigation**: By banning waste disposal that attracts birds, the regulations reduce the risk of bird strikes.
3. **Clearance Zones**: The approach, transitional, and outer surfaces create protected zones that ensure pilots have unimpeded visibility and flight paths.
4. **Consistency with Planning**: The regulations are based on detailed Public Works Canada zoning plans (S-1448 series), dated December 31, 1984, which provide precise technical and geographic descriptions.

---

## **Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Issue directives to remove vegetation exceeding surface limits.
  - Enforce compliance with the rules.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, though specific enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in this regulation.

---

## **Significance**

- This regulation is a foundational piece of aviation safety infrastructure in Newfoundland.
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to **aeronautical zoning** as a method of protecting air traffic safety through spatial planning.
- It sets a precedent for how airports in remote or rural areas can be managed with clear, measurable boundaries and environmental safeguards.

## **Conclusion**

The *Wabush Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive, technically precise framework for managing land use around Wabush Airport. By defining key elevation surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), setting strict limits on construction, and prohibiting bird-attractive waste, the regulations significantly enhance flight safety and operational efficiency. The detailed geometric descriptions and reliance on official survey plans ensure clarity and enforceability. These regulations remain a critical component of Canada’s aviation safety system, particularly in regions where natural terrain and proximity to populated areas increase operational risks.
