**Detailed Summary of the Marketing Authorization:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Marketing Authorization to Permit a Lower Calcium Threshold for Exemptions from the Requirement for Prepackaged Products to Carry a Nutrition Symbol in the Case of Cheese, Yogurt, Kefir, and Buttermilk  
**Legal Basis:**  
S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 416; R.S., c. F-27  
**Issued by:** Minister of Health  
**Date of Issuance:** Ottawa, May 13, 2024  
**Effective Date:** The day on which it is registered (i.e., upon official registration with Health Canada)

### **Purpose of the Authorization**

This Marketing Authorization modifies the existing requirements under the *Food and Drug Regulations* (FDR) to provide **exemptions from the mandatory nutrition symbol** (specifically, the nutrition facts panel or nutrition label) for certain prepackaged dairy products — namely **cheese, yogurt (including drinkable yogurt), kefir, and buttermilk** — when they meet a specific **calcium content threshold**.

Under normal rules, all prepackaged food products must carry a nutrition symbol that includes information on key nutrients such as saturated fat, sugars, sodium, and calcium. However, this authorization allows certain dairy-based products to be **exempt from this requirement** if they meet a defined calcium content standard — specifically, **5% or more of the daily value (DV) for calcium per serving**.

---

### **Scope of Exemption**

The exemption applies to **prepackaged products** that fall into the following categories:

1. **Cheese** – Made from dairy products  
2. **Yogurt** – Including drinkable yogurt  
3. **Kefir**  
4. **Buttermilk**

These products are considered part of the dairy category and are subject to the general nutrition labeling rules, but this authorization allows them to **avoid the nutrition symbol requirement** if they meet the calcium threshold.

### **Key Conditions for Exemption**

#### 1. **Exemption from Saturated Fat and Sugars Labeling (Applicable to Cheese, Yogurt, Kefir, Buttermilk)**  
- Prepackaged products in these categories are **exempt from the requirement to display the nutrition symbol** regarding **saturated fat and sugars** if they contain **5% or more of the daily value (DV) for calcium per serving**.
- The "serving size" is defined as the stated serving size on the packaging or the reference amount (whichever is greater).

> **Example:** A serving of a yogurt that contains 5% or more of the daily calcium value (e.g., 300 mg of calcium in a 100g serving, where the DV is 1000 mg) would qualify for this exemption from saturated fat and sugar labeling.

#### 2. **Exemption from Sodium Labeling (Applicable Only to Cheese)**  
- For **cheese made from dairy products**, there is a **separate exemption** from the requirement to display sodium information on the nutrition symbol **if** the product contains **5% or more of the daily value for calcium per serving**.
- This exemption applies only to **sodium**, not to saturated fat or sugars.

> **Note:** This is a narrower exemption than the one for saturated fat and sugars — it only applies to cheese and specifically to sodium.

### **Legal Framework and Definitions**

- All terms and expressions used in this authorization are interpreted in accordance with their meaning in the *Food and Drug Regulations* (FDR).
- The regulation references specific provisions in the FDR:
  - **Subsection B.01.350(12)**: Requires labeling of saturated fat and sugars.
  - **Subsection B.01.350(11)**: Requires labeling of sodium (for cheese).
  - **Subsection B.01.350(9)**: Defines the calcium daily value threshold for labeling purposes.

> The calcium threshold is **5% of the daily value**, which is a **lower threshold** than the general rule that might otherwise apply (which may require higher nutrient levels to trigger labeling). This reflects a policy decision to reduce labeling burden on products that are nutritionally beneficial and already high in calcium — a key nutrient for bone health.

---

### **How the Threshold is Determined**

- The "daily value for calcium" is based on the **reference daily intake** established by Health Canada (typically 1000 mg/day for adults).
- The product must meet or exceed **5% of 1000 mg = 50 mg of calcium per serving** (or per reference amount, whichever is greater).
- The serving size is determined by the product’s labeling — either the stated serving size or the reference amount (as defined in the FDR), whichever is larger.

> Example: A 100g serving of a cheese product contains 250 mg of calcium → 250 mg / 1000 mg = 25% of the DV → exceeds 5% → qualifies for exemption.

---

### **Impact and Rationale**

- **Reduces consumer burden**: By exempting products with high calcium content from mandatory nutrition labels, the regulation simplifies packaging and reduces labeling complexity for manufacturers and consumers.
- **Promotes health-focused products**: Cheese, yogurt, kefir, and buttermilk are naturally rich in calcium and are considered important sources of dietary calcium. This exemption recognizes their nutritional value.
- **Targets specific nutrients**: The exemption focuses on nutrients that are already well-present in these products — calcium, saturated fat, and sodium — allowing for more targeted regulation.
- **Balances consumer information and industry practicality**: While the general rule requires nutrition labels, this exception ensures that products that already provide a significant benefit (calcium) are not burdened with redundant or less relevant information.

---

### **Effective Date**

- This authorization comes into force on the day it is officially registered with Health Canada.
- The registration process is a formal step that ensures the rule is properly published and enforced.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Marketing Authorization is a targeted regulatory adjustment designed to:

- **Simplify labeling requirements** for prepackaged dairy products (cheese, yogurt, kefir, buttermilk)  
- **Recognize the high calcium content** of these products  
- **Provide exemptions from mandatory nutrition labeling** for saturated fat and sugars (and sodium in cheese) **when calcium content meets or exceeds 5% of the daily value**  

It reflects a practical, health-based approach to food labeling, balancing transparency with the need to avoid over-labeling products that are already nutritionally sound.

---

**Note:** This authorization does **not** eliminate the requirement to provide nutrition information in other forms (e.g., ingredient lists, allergens, or other mandatory claims). It only removes the **mandatory nutrition symbol** for specific nutrients when the calcium threshold is met. Consumers are still expected to understand the nutritional profile of these products through other means, such as product descriptions or ingredient lists.
