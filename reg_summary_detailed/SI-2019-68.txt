**1. Legal Basis and Authority:**  
This regulation is issued under the authority granted by **paragraph 55(a)** of the *National Security and Intelligence Review Agency Act* (NSIRA Act). This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to designate a Minister as the responsible Minister for the Act.

The Governor General in Council is the formal head of the Canadian government and serves as the ceremonial and constitutional head of state. However, in practice, such designations are made on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, reflecting the principle of responsible government.

**2. Key Provision:**  
The regulation designates the **Prime Minister** as the **Minister responsible** for the *National Security and Intelligence Review Agency Act*.

This means that the Prime Minister holds the official responsibility for the administration, oversight, and implementation of the Act. As the Minister responsible, the Prime Minister is accountable for:

- Ensuring the Act is properly implemented and enforced.
- Providing policy direction and strategic oversight of the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA).
- Approving key decisions, reports, and operational matters under the Act.
- Ensuring alignment between NSIRA’s activities and broader national security and democratic accountability frameworks.

---

**3. Purpose and Significance:**  
The designation of the Prime Minister as the Minister responsible for the NSIRA Act serves several important purposes:

- **Accountability:** It ensures that the highest level of government is directly accountable for the oversight of intelligence and national security review processes, reinforcing democratic accountability.
- **Policy Leadership:** The Prime Minister, as head of government, sets the policy tone and priorities for national security, which directly affects the mandate and function of NSIRA.
- **Coordination:** It facilitates coordination between the executive branch and NSIRA, ensuring that intelligence review processes are aligned with government priorities and democratic safeguards.
- **Public Confidence:** By placing the Prime Minister in this role, the government signals a commitment to transparency, oversight, and the rule of law in national security matters.

---

**4. Context of the NSIRA Act:**  
The *National Security and Intelligence Review Agency Act* establishes NSIRA as an independent agency tasked with reviewing the activities of Canada’s intelligence and security agencies (such as CSIS, CSE, and the RCMP) to ensure they are lawful, necessary, and consistent with democratic values and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

NSIRA’s mandate includes reviewing:

- Surveillance activities
- Intelligence gathering
- Security operations
- Compliance with legal and constitutional standards

The Act emphasizes that such activities must be subject to **independent review**, **transparency**, and **accountability** to protect civil liberties.

**5. Implications of the Designation:**  
By designating the Prime Minister as the Minister responsible, the regulation:

- Establishes a formal link between the executive branch and NSIRA.
- Ensures that the Prime Minister has the authority to intervene or provide direction when necessary.
- May also create a pathway for the Prime Minister to formally approve or challenge NSIRA’s recommendations or reports, particularly when they involve significant national security or constitutional implications.

However, the Prime Minister’s role is not to operate NSIRA directly but to provide **strategic leadership and accountability**. The day-to-day operations and reviews remain under the authority of NSIRA and its oversight mechanisms.

---

**6. Effective Date and Source:**  
This regulation was enacted as part of **Statutory Citation S.C. 2019, c. 13, section 2**, which is the *National Security and Intelligence Review Agency Act*. It came into force on the day it was passed (April 2, 2019), and remains in force as part of the current legislative framework.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally assigns the Prime Minister the role of Minister responsible for the *National Security and Intelligence Review Agency Act*. It underscores the importance of executive leadership in ensuring that national security activities are conducted within legal, democratic, and constitutional boundaries. The designation reinforces accountability, transparency, and oversight — key principles in maintaining public trust in Canada’s intelligence and security institutions.
