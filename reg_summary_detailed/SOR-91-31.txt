### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation on Non-Taxable Goods Upon Importation (S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12)**

This regulation, made under **subsection 277(1)** of the *Excise Tax Act*, establishes a list of goods that are **exempt from excise tax** when imported under specific, prescribed circumstances. It was originally enacted in 1990 and has since undergone repeals and amendments, with key parts now **repealed or amended** (e.g., SOR/2002-277, SOR/2014-248). However, the core structure and intent remain relevant in defining situations where importation of certain goods does not trigger excise tax liability.

---

## **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective is to **exclude certain goods from excise tax** when they are imported for specific non-commercial, temporary, or public-use purposes — particularly where:
- The goods are not intended to be used or retained in Canada,
- They are exported shortly after importation,
- Or they serve a public or official function.

This supports international trade, temporary operations, public exhibitions, and official gifts, while ensuring compliance with tax principles and avoiding undue tax burdens on legitimate commercial or governmental activities.
