**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Beluga Whale (Delphinapterus leucas) St. Lawrence Estuary Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
November 30, 2017  
**Effective Date:** Upon registration (i.e., publication in the Canada Gazette)

---

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under **Section 58 of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA)**, enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), which provides the legal framework for identifying, protecting, and managing critical habitat for wildlife species at risk.

- The **Beluga Whale (Delphinapterus leucas) St. Lawrence Estuary Population** is designated as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA**.
- A formal **recovery strategy** for this population has been developed and is publicly accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, identifying the areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery — known as **critical habitat**.
- This regulation specifically addresses the **critical habitat** of this population, with key exclusions based on legal and administrative considerations.

### **2. Key Legal Provisions Involved**

#### **Section 58(2)(b) of SARA**  
This provision identifies certain areas that are **exempt from being included in the critical habitat designation** because they are protected under other federal or provincial legislation. Specifically, it refers to areas designated as **migratory bird sanctuaries** or **national wildlife areas** under other environmental laws.

> In this case, the portion of the critical habitat located within:
> - The **Île aux Basques Bird Sanctuary** (under the *Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations*)
> - The **Îles de l’Estuaire National Wildlife Area** (under the *Wildlife Area Regulations*)

...is **excluded from the critical habitat designation** under subsection 58(2)(b).

#### **Section 58(5) of SARA**  
This section mandates that any critical habitat that falls within a protected area under another federal law (such as a bird sanctuary or wildlife area) must be **excluded** from the critical habitat designation to avoid conflicting with existing protections.

#### **Section 58(9) of SARA**  
This provision requires the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** to **consult** with the **Minister of the Environment** (who oversees Parks Canada) when an Order designating critical habitat would affect land under the jurisdiction of Parks Canada.

> In this case, the MFO consulted with the Minister of the Environment to ensure that the critical habitat designation would not interfere with existing protected areas managed by Parks Canada.

### **3. Purpose and Scope of the Order**

The **Critical Habitat Order** establishes the **legal boundaries of critical habitat** for the Beluga Whale (St. Lawrence Estuary population), **excluding** specific portions that fall within protected areas governed by other federal legislation.

#### **What is Included in the Order?**  
- The critical habitat of the Beluga Whale population in the St. Lawrence Estuary, as identified in the recovery strategy and registered in the Species at Risk Public Registry.
- **Exclusions**:
  - All areas within the **Île aux Basques Bird Sanctuary** (Part V of the *Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations*)
  - All areas within the **Îles de l’Estuaire National Wildlife Area** (Part III of Schedule I to the *Wildlife Area Regulations*)

These exclusions are legally required under **SARA, section 58(2)(b)** and **section 58(5)**.

---

### **4. Administrative and Policy Rationale**

- The Order ensures **consistency** between SARA’s critical habitat provisions and existing environmental protections.
- It prevents **conflicts or duplication** in land-use management by recognizing that certain areas are already protected under other laws (e.g., bird sanctuaries for migratory birds, national wildlife areas for biodiversity).
- The **consultation process** with the Minister of the Environment (Parks Canada) demonstrates **inter-agency coordination** and adherence to procedural requirements under SARA.

---

### **5. Legal Effect and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force upon registration** in the *Canada Gazette*.
- It is binding on all federal, provincial, and territorial governments, as well as on private landowners and developers, under the **provisions of SARA**.
- Any activity that would **disturb or degrade** the designated critical habitat (excluding the exempted areas) is subject to regulatory scrutiny and may require permits or mitigation measures.
- The exclusion of areas within bird sanctuaries and wildlife areas means that those areas are **not subject to critical habitat protection under SARA**, though they remain protected under their respective governing regulations.

---

### **6. Significance and Conservation Implications**

- This Order supports the **recovery of the endangered St. Lawrence Beluga population** by clearly defining where conservation efforts must be focused.
- It acknowledges the **complexity of land-use planning** in ecologically sensitive regions like the St. Lawrence Estuary, where multiple species and ecosystems coexist.
- By respecting existing protections for birds and other wildlife, the Order promotes **integrated conservation** and avoids unnecessary regulatory burdens on land management agencies.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **legally sound and ecologically responsible** designation of critical habitat for the Beluga Whale population in the St. Lawrence Estuary. It:

- Identifies and protects the essential habitat required for the species’ survival and recovery,
- Excludes areas already protected under other federal laws (bird sanctuaries and national wildlife areas),
- Ensures compliance with procedural requirements under SARA (particularly sections 58(2)(b), 58(5), and 58(9)),
- Promotes cooperation between federal agencies (Fisheries and Oceans and Environment),
- And advances the broader goal of biodiversity conservation in Canada.

It represents a balanced approach to species recovery — recognizing both the need for targeted protection and the importance of respecting existing environmental protections.
