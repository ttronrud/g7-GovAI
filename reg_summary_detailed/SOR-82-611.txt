- **Section 3 – Insurance of Loans**:
  - The Minister may provide **insurance for the full amount of any loss** that may occur due to a loan made by a private lender to SAFL.
  - This insurance is available **subject to section 6**, which imposes a cap on the total amount of insurance that can be provided.

### **4. Limitations on Insurance Payments**

- **Payment Cap Based on Demand Date**:
  - If a private lender demands repayment of a loan for which insurance has been provided, the **amount payable under the insurance will not exceed the amount of insurance that was in effect on the date of the demand**.
  - This means that the insurance is **not retroactive** and does not cover future losses beyond the value of the policy at the time of repayment demand.

- **Aggregate Insurance Limit**:
  - The **total amount of insurance** that the Minister may provide across all loans to SAFL by private lenders **shall not exceed CAD $10 million at any one time**.
  - This cap applies **to all private lender loans combined**.
  - **Approval of the Treasury Board is required** if the total insurance coverage exceeds $10 million.

### **5. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Mitigation** | Protects private lenders from loss due to SAFL’s failure to repay loans, promoting private capital investment. |
| **Exclusion of Public Entities** | Prevents government or provincial agencies from benefiting from the insurance scheme, maintaining the private nature of the lending. |
| **Government Oversight** | Requires Ministerial review and Treasury Board approval for high-risk or large-scale insurance, ensuring accountability. |
| **Time-Bound Coverage** | Insurance is limited to the value in effect at the time of repayment demand, preventing overpayment. |
| **Financial Cap** | A clear ceiling of $10 million ensures the program remains financially sustainable and does not become a long-term liability. |

### **6. Legal and Administrative Framework**

- The regulations are grounded in **federal fiscal authority** (Appropriation Act No. 1, 1980–81, Vote 1a), meaning the government has allocated funds specifically for this purpose.
- The Minister has **discretionary power** to approve insurance, but only within the bounds of the law and financial limits.
- The **Treasury Board** acts as a fiscal gatekeeper, requiring approval for any insurance exceeding $10 million.

### **7. Broader Context and Relevance**

These regulations reflect a **targeted financial intervention** to support a specific business entity (SAFL) in a key sector—**fisheries**—during a period when private investment might otherwise be hesitant due to perceived risk. By offering insurance, the government aims to:

- Encourage private capital flow into the fisheries sector;
- Stabilize the operations of SAFL;
- Support economic development in Newfoundland.

However, the strict limits (especially the $10 million cap and exclusion of public lenders) ensure that the program remains **limited in scope and accountable**, avoiding misuse or overreach.

### **Conclusion**

The *St. Anthony Fisheries Limited Regulations* establish a **controlled, risk-managed insurance mechanism** for private loans extended to a specific Canadian company. The rules are designed to balance **financial support for private investment** with **fiscal responsibility and accountability**. By defining clear eligibility criteria, setting strict caps, and requiring government oversight, the regulations ensure that the insurance program serves its intended purpose without creating undue financial exposure for the federal government.

These regulations are a **classic example of targeted federal financial intervention** in a private sector enterprise, reflecting the interplay between economic policy, risk management, and fiscal discipline in Canadian regulatory practice.
