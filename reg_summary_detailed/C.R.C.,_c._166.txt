**Detailed Summary of the Nova Scotia Egg Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Nova Scotia Egg Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a statutory instrument under the *Natural Products Marketing Act* of Nova Scotia (Loi).

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Nova Scotia* (Loi), which provides the legal framework for the regulation and marketing of natural products, including eggs. This Act authorizes the Commodity Board to carry out marketing functions and manage trade-related policies.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Nova Scotia Egg and Pullet Producers’ Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation). This body is established under the Act and is responsible for overseeing the marketing, pricing, and economic management of eggs produced in Nova Scotia.

- **Egg**: Defined broadly to include:
  - The egg of a hen produced in Nova Scotia; and  
  - The egg product (such as processed or manufactured forms like egg powder, liquid, or other derivatives) that is produced and prepared in Nova Scotia.  
  This definition ensures that both raw and processed egg products derived from Nova Scotian hens are covered under the regulation.

- **Hen**: Refers to any domestic chicken (species *Gallus domesticus*) regardless of breed or class. This ensures inclusivity across all types of hens involved in egg production in the province.

**3. Authority and Powers of the Commodity Board**  
The Commodity Board is granted specific powers related to the marketing of eggs in **interprovincial trade** and **export trade**. These powers are critical for ensuring fair market practices, stabilizing prices, and protecting producers from market volatility.

Specifically, the Board is authorized to:

- **Fix levies or charges**: Determine the amount of fees or taxes to be imposed on individuals or entities engaged in marketing eggs within Nova Scotia.  
- **Impose levies or charges**: Enforce these fees on producers, distributors, or marketers involved in the sale of eggs outside the province or internationally.  
- **Collect levies or charges**: Require payment from those engaged in egg marketing, ensuring financial accountability and revenue generation.

---

**4. Classification of Marketers**  
The Board has the authority to **classify persons engaged in egg marketing into different groups**. This classification allows for differentiated treatment based on factors such as:

- Size of operation  
- Type of marketing activity (e.g., direct sales, wholesale, export)  
- Geographic location  
- Volume of sales  

By grouping marketers, the Board can tailor levies or charges to reflect the economic capacity and market role of each entity, ensuring fairness and proportionality.

---

**5. Determination of Levies and Charges**  
The Board may **fix different levies or charges for members of different groups**. This means that:

- A small-scale farmer selling eggs locally may pay a lower fee than a large-scale processor or exporter.  
- The fees are not uniform and are instead based on the group classification, allowing for equitable distribution of costs across the egg industry.

---

**6. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The revenues collected from levies and charges are not restricted in their use. The Commodity Board may use these funds for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves**: Building financial reserves to cushion against future market downturns or supply shocks.  
- **Payment of expenses and losses**: Covering operational costs, losses incurred from the sale or disposal of eggs (e.g., due to poor market conditions or spoilage), and administrative expenses.  
- **Equalization and adjustment of earnings among producers**:  
  - The Board may use the funds to **equalize or adjust** the financial returns among egg producers.  
  - This ensures that producers who may have experienced lower sales or market returns (due to market fluctuations, poor demand, or external factors) are compensated.  
  - Adjustments can be made over **specific periods or timeframes** as the Board determines appropriate.

This mechanism supports economic stability and fairness within the egg-producing community, especially during times of market volatility.

---

**7. Repealed Provision**  
A previous section of the Order (Sor/80-90) has been **repealed**. This indicates that earlier provisions on similar matters have been replaced or superseded, likely to reflect updated policy or administrative needs. The current version represents a revised and streamlined approach to egg marketing regulation.

---

**Overall Purpose and Significance**  
The *Nova Scotia Egg Order* serves as a critical tool for the Nova Scotia Egg and Pullet Producers’ Marketing Board to:

- Regulate and stabilize the interprovincial and export markets for eggs.  
- Ensure fair and equitable financial outcomes for producers.  
- Generate revenue to support industry resilience through reserves and loss compensation.  
- Promote sustainable marketing practices by classifying and charging based on market activity and scale.

It reflects a balance between market-based pricing and producer protection, ensuring that Nova Scotia’s egg industry remains competitive, financially viable, and responsive to market dynamics.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation empowers the Commodity Board to implement a structured, fair, and responsive system for collecting fees from egg marketers. These fees are used not only to fund operational costs but also to support producer equity and economic stability—key elements in maintaining a healthy and resilient agricultural sector in Nova Scotia.
