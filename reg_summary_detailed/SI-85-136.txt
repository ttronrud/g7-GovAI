**Detailed Summary of the IRSTD System Remission Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *IRSTD System Remission Order* is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act*, specifically pursuant to **Section 17**, by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board**. The order was enacted to promote national defense and technological advancement by providing **customs duty remission** on certain goods imported for the development of the **Infra-Red Search and Target Designation (IRSTD) System**.

This regulation is designed to support Canada’s defense capabilities through the procurement and development of advanced infrared technology used in military aircraft for detecting and designating targets.

### **Official Citation and Title**

- **Citation:** S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4  
- **Title:** *IRSTD System Remission Order*  
- **Purpose:** To remit (i.e., waive or forgive) customs duties on eligible goods imported during a specified period for the production of the IRSTD System.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

1. **"Goods"**  
   This term encompasses a broad range of materials and items directly related to the development, operation, and maintenance of the IRSTD System. Specifically, goods include:
   - **Materials, components, and parts** used in the production of an IRSTD System that form or will form part of the system.
   - **Materials (excluding fuel or plant equipment)** consumed directly in the production of the system or its components.
   - **Equipment and parts thereof** used for:
     - Testing, maintaining, or operating the IRSTD System or its parts.
     - Training personnel to perform such tasks.
   - **Manuals and revisions** of manuals, including technical and other data used to:
     - Aid in testing, maintenance, or operation of the system.
     - Train personnel in those functions.
   - **Procurement-related items** and **installation and checkout kits** for the IRSTD System.

   > *Note:* The definition emphasizes that only goods directly tied to the system’s development, testing, maintenance, or training are eligible.

2. **"IRSTD System"**  
   Refers to an **Engineering Development Model (EDM)** or any part thereof, developed under the **Infra-Red Search and Target Designation Project**.  
   - The project was formally approved by the **Treasury Board** through:
     - **Minute TB 789702**, dated **October 6, 1983**.
     - Amended by **Minute TB 794850**, dated **August 1, 1984**.
   - The IRSTD System is a military-grade technology used to detect and designate targets using infrared sensors, typically mounted on fighter aircraft.

3. **"Production"**  
   Broadly defined to include:
   - Development, design, manufacture, testing, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification, and conversion of components or systems related to the IRSTD System.

### **Main Provision: Duty Remission**

- **Remission of Customs Duties:**  
  The Order grants a **full remission** of customs duties that would otherwise be payable under the *Customs Tariff* for goods imported during the period:

  > **April 1, 1984 – March 31, 1992**

  This means that importers of eligible goods during this timeframe are **not required to pay customs duties**, even if such duties would normally apply under standard tariff schedules.

- **Scope of Remission:**  
  Applies specifically to goods used in the **production** of the IRSTD System, as defined above.

---

### **Conditions for the Remission**

The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to two key conditions:

1. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   - Any importer must **submit a claim for remission to the Minister of National Revenue within three years of the date of importation** of the goods.  
   - Failure to meet this deadline results in the **loss of the remission benefit**.

2. **Cooperation and Reporting Obligations**  
   - Importers are required to **provide any reports or information** that the Minister of National Revenue may reasonably request for the **administration and oversight** of this Order.  
   - This ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with the purpose of the remission — namely, supporting a critical national defense project.

---

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council issued the Order **"considering that it is in the public interest to do so"**, indicating that:
- The development of the IRSTD System is vital to **national security** and **military readiness**.
- The technology enhances Canada’s ability to detect and engage targets in modern combat scenarios, particularly in low-visibility environments (e.g., night operations or adverse weather).
- The remission helps reduce financial barriers to acquiring specialized, high-value components, enabling timely and cost-effective development of the system.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- The Order is authorized under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to make regulations for the purpose of remitting or modifying customs duties when it is in the public interest.
- The recommendation from the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board** underscores the alignment of the remission with both fiscal policy and strategic defense priorities.

### **Key Implications and Considerations**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Duration** | Remission applies only from **April 1, 1984, to March 31, 1992** — a 8-year period. |
| **Eligibility** | Only goods directly related to IRSTD System production are eligible. |
| **Compliance Requirement** | Importers must act promptly (within 3 years) to claim remission and provide required reporting. |
| **Oversight** | The Minister of National Revenue retains authority to verify compliance and ensure the remission is used appropriately. |
| **Historical Context** | This order reflects Canada’s investment in defense technology during the late 20th century, particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s. |

### **Conclusion**

The *IRSTD System Remission Order* is a targeted, time-limited regulatory measure that enables Canada to advance its defense capabilities by reducing the cost of importing specialized materials and equipment for the development of an advanced infrared targeting system. By waiving customs duties on eligible goods during a defined period, the government supports national security objectives while maintaining fiscal and administrative accountability through clear claim and reporting requirements.

This Order exemplifies how public interest considerations — particularly in defense and strategic technology — can justify temporary exemptions from standard trade regulations under federal authority. It remains a significant historical example of government intervention in the customs regime to support national defense innovation.

*Note: This regulation is no longer in force as the IRSTD Project has since concluded, and the relevant technologies have been integrated into other defense systems. However, it remains a notable case study in the use of customs duty remission for strategic defense projects.*
