## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Concentration Limits for Certain Products Regulations**

### 📌 **Legal Basis and Context**

This regulation was made under **section 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, and specifically pursuant to **sections 286.1d and 326** of the Act. It was issued by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, following a formal consultation process.

#### Key Procedural Steps:
- On **July 6, 2019**, the Minister of the Environment published a **proposed regulation** in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, inviting public comment.
- A period was provided for stakeholders to:
  - File **comments** on the proposed rules, or
  - File a **notice of objection** requesting a **board of review** and providing reasons.
- The **National Advisory Committee** was given an opportunity to provide expert advice under **section 6c** of CEPA 1999.
- The Governor in Council concluded that the proposed regulation:
  - Does **not overlap** with existing environmental or health regulations under other Acts;
  - Provides **sufficient protection** to human health and the environment;
  - Is consistent with the legislative intent of CEPA 1999.

➡️ Therefore, the regulation was formally **adopted and enacted**.

## 📚 **Core Definitions**

The regulation defines key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **VOC (Volatile Organic Compound)** | A compound that participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions and is **not excluded** under item 65 of Schedule 1 to CEPA 1999. |
| **Fragrance** | A substance or mixture with a combined vapour pressure ≤ 0.267 kPa at 20°C, intended solely to impart scent or mask odour. |
| **Adhesive** | Excludes products used on humans/animals or those with adhesive on an inert substrate. |
| **High Vapour Pressure VOC** (in antiperspirants/deodorants) | VOC with vapour pressure >10.67 kPa at 20°C. |
| **Low Vapour Pressure VOC** | VOC with vapour pressure <0.013 kPa at 20°C, boiling point >216°C, or containing >12 carbon atoms per molecule. |
| **Medium Vapour Pressure VOC** (in antiperspirants/deodorants) | VOC with vapour pressure >0.267 kPa but ≤10.67 kPa at 20°C. |
| **Reformulated Product** | A product in a category listed in Schedule 1 or 2 that has been reformulated to reduce VOC concentration below the maximum allowed level. |

> All VOC concentrations are expressed as a **percentage by weight (% w/w)** of the product’s **net weight**.

## 🎯 **Scope of Application**

### ✅ Applies To:
- Any product containing VOCs that falls into a product category listed in:
  - **Column 1 of Schedule 1** (e.g., personal care, cleaning products)
  - **Column 1 of Schedule 2** (e.g., aerosols, charcoal lighters)

### ❌ Does NOT Apply To:
- Products designed solely for **manufacturing or processing** activities.
- Products used **exclusively in laboratories** (analysis, research, standards).
- Products regulated under the **Pest Control Products Act**.
- Products **manufactured or imported only for export**.
- **Adhesives** with container size ≤30 mL.
- Products already regulated under:
  - *VOC Concentration Limits for Architectural Coatings Regulations*
  - *VOC Concentration Limits for Automotive Refinishing Products Regulations*
- Products used **in or on a new car at the time of manufacture**.
- Products **in transit** through Canada (from outside to outside Canada).

## ⚠️ Prohibitions on Manufacturing and Importing

### General Prohibition (Section 1):
> A person **must not manufacture or import** a product belonging to a category in Schedule 1 or 2 if:
> - Its VOC concentration exceeds the **maximum allowed level** in column 3 of the relevant table, **unless**:
>   1. The product is **to be diluted before use** (as per instructions on container or documentation), resulting in a VOC concentration ≤ the maximum limit; **OR**
>   2. A **permit** has been issued under **section 9, 16, or 19** of CEPA 1999.

### Emission-Based Prohibition (Section 2):
> A person must not manufacture or import a product in Schedule 2 (e.g., aerosols, lighters) with **VOC emission potential** exceeding the maximum allowed level **unless**:
> - A **permit** under **section 19** has been issued.

> ⚠️ **Exception**: The dilution exemption **does not apply** to **multi-purpose solvents or paint thinners** (items 48 and 52 in Schedule 1).

---

## 📅 Effective Date of Prohibitions

- For **disinfectants** (item 31 in Schedule 1):  
  → Effective on **January 1 of the year after the 3rd anniversary** of the regulation’s registration.
- For **all other products**:  
  → Effective on **January 1 of the year after the 2nd anniversary** of registration.

> This phased implementation allows industry time to adjust.

## 📏 Determining VOC Concentration

The VOC concentration is calculated using a formula:

$$
\text{VOC Concentration (\% w/w)} = \frac{W_S}{W_{EX}} \times 100
$$

Where:
- **W_S** = Total weight (in grams) of substances that **volatize** during testing.
- **W_EX** = Weight of substances **excluded** from the calculation (based on type and category).

### Exclusions by Product Type:
| Product Type | Excluded Components |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Antiperspirant/Deodorant** | VOCs ≤0.267 kPa (or >10C atoms), colourants/fragrances ≤2% of net weight, ethanol |
| **Personal Fragrance (item 11)** | Low-vapour pressure VOCs, fragrances |
| **Pressurized Gas Duster (item 53)** | Low-vapour pressure VOCs |
| **Other products** | Low-vapour pressure VOCs, fragrances ≤2% of net weight |

> For **aerosol products**, propellant and non-propellant fractions are calculated **separately** and then summed.

> For **antiperspirants/deodorants**, VOCs are split into **medium** and **high vapour pressure** categories for separate calculation.

## 🚀 VOC Emission Potential (Schedule 2 Products)

When determining **emission potential** (e.g., for aerosols or lighters), the following are **excluded**:
- Low-vapour pressure VOCs
- In **charcoal lighter products (item 1 of Schedule 2)**: fragrances ≤2% of net weight

## 🔄 Compliance Unit Trading System (CUTS)

To support compliance, a **compliance unit trading system** is introduced, allowing companies to:
1. **Generate compliance units** (1 unit per kg of reformulated product).
2. **Transfer unused units** to other companies.
3. **Use units** to offset excess VOCs in products that exceed the maximum allowed concentration.

### How Units Are Generated:
- A company must submit a **notice by October 1** of the first year of participation.
- The notice includes:
  - Company and representative details
  - Product name, category, and subcategory
  - Pre-reformulation VOC concentration, reformulation date, post-reformulation concentration
  - Expected annual production (excluding exports)

> **Formula for Units Generated**:
$$
\text{Compliance Units} = \sum \left( \frac{(C_{\text{max}} - C_{\text{actual}})}{C_{\text{max}}} \times Q \right)
$$
Where:
- $C_{\text{max}}$ = Maximum allowed VOC concentration (from Schedule 1)
- $C_{\text{actual}}$ = Actual VOC concentration after reformulation
- $Q$ = Quantity of product (kg) manufactured/imported in a year (excluding exports)

> For the **first year**, the base period starts from **the date of notice submission or reformulation**, whichever is later.

### Validity of Compliance Units:
- Valid for **2 years**, starting on **January 1 of the year after generation**.

> The Minister must issue **written confirmation** of unit availability within **60 days** of receiving a report under section 14.
