**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title of Regulation:**  
Order Respecting the Remission of Interest Payments Owing to the Government of Canada on Loans Made to the Republic of Cameroon, the Republic of Madagascar and the Republic of Zambia

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of key federal ministers) to remit (i.e., forgive or cancel) accrued interest payments owed by the Government of Canada to certain foreign governments, provided that such remission is in the **public interest**.

**Key Parties Involved:**  
- **Government of Canada** – The creditor party; the interest payments were originally due to the Canadian government.  
- **Republic of Cameroon, the Republic of Madagascar, and the Republic of Zambia** – The recipient countries whose interest obligations are being remitted.  
- **Ministers Involved:**  
  - Minister of Finance  
  - Minister of Foreign Affairs  
  - Treasury Board  
  These ministers jointly recommended the remission, indicating a coordinated assessment of economic, diplomatic, and fiscal considerations.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
To **cancel or remit** (forgive) the accrued interest payments that the Government of Canada had previously incurred on loans made to the three African nations—Cameroon, Madagascar, and Zambia—through the **Canada Account**.

**What is the Canada Account?**  
The Canada Account is a special fund established by the Government of Canada to provide development assistance and loans to other countries. These loans are typically made under multilateral or bilateral development frameworks and are intended to support economic development, infrastructure, and social programs in developing nations. Interest on such loans is generally due, but the government may choose to remit interest under specific circumstances.

**Scope of the Remission:**  
- The remission applies **only** to **accrued interest** (not principal amounts).  
- The amount of interest remitted is specified in **column 2 of the Schedule** attached to the Order.  
- The amount is **not repayable** by the respective countries; it is effectively forgiven.  
- The remitted amounts are **specific to each country** and are listed in **column 1** of the Schedule (the country) and **column 2** (the amount of interest forgiven).

**Public Interest Justification:**  
The Governor General in Council has determined that the remission of these interest payments is in the **public interest**. This likely includes considerations such as:  
- Strengthening diplomatic and economic relations with developing nations.  
- Supporting development and stability in fragile or post-conflict countries.  
- Promoting international cooperation and multilateral development goals.  
- Avoiding undue financial burden on developing nations that may be struggling with debt servicing.  
- Aligning with Canada’s foreign policy objectives of poverty reduction, sustainable development, and global equity.

**Legal Effect:**  
- The remission is **final and binding**.  
- The Government of Canada is relieved of the obligation to collect or repay the specified interest amounts.  
- The interest is **not treated as a debt** and is not recoverable under any future financial arrangements.  
- The Order is published in the *Canada Gazette* (as referenced in S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)), making it a formal and legally enforceable instrument.

**Historical Context:**  
This regulation was enacted in **1991** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)), during a period when Canada was actively engaged in international development lending. The forgiveness of interest on loans to African nations reflects a broader trend of **developmental debt relief** and **humanitarian diplomacy**, especially in the post-colonial era.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a deliberate policy decision by the Government of Canada to **forgive accrued interest** on development loans made to Cameroon, Madagascar, and Zambia. It is grounded in legal authority, inter-ministerial consensus, and a stated public interest justification. The move underscores Canada’s commitment to fostering development, strengthening global partnerships, and promoting equitable international financial relations—particularly with nations in sub-Saharan Africa.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The remission of interest is not a general policy but a targeted, country-specific action under the Financial Administration Act, designed to support development and diplomatic objectives, while maintaining fiscal responsibility and transparency.
