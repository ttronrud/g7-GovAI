### **Detailed Summary of the Aklavik Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

These regulations are established under **section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports in Canada. The proposed regulations were first published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette Part I* on **November 14 and 21, 1992**, and later in two issues of local newspapers — *News of the North* (January 25 and February 1, 1993) and *L’Aquilon* (January 29 and February 5, 1993). This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, local communities, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the proposed rules.

Based on this public consultation, the regulations are now formally enacted as the **Aklavik Airport Zoning Regulations**, effective from the date of publication.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **protect the safety and operational efficiency of Aklavik Airport** by establishing strict height restrictions on structures, buildings, and natural growth near the airport. These restrictions are designed to prevent interference with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases — particularly by ensuring unobstructed visibility and flight paths.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical spatial and technical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Aklavik Airport**, located in the vicinity of Aklavik, Northwest Territories.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed reference point on the airport’s runway centerline, located **457 meters from the threshold of runway 30**, on the centerline of runway 12–30.  
  - **Elevation**: 6.7 meters above sea level.

- **Approach Surfaces**: Imaginary inclined planes extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (runway 12–30).  
  - Each approach surface has a **1:30 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 30 meters horizontal distance).  
  - They rise to an imaginary horizontal line located **2,500 meters horizontally from the runway end**, which is **83.3 meters above the elevation at the runway end**.  
  - The outer ends of this horizontal line are **295 meters from the runway centerline**.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary plane at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP** (i.e., 6.7 m + 45 m = 51.7 m above sea level).  
  - However, if this elevation would place the outer surface **less than 9 meters above ground level**, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe enforcement.

- **Strip**: The main runway and adjacent landing area for runway 12–30.  
  - **Width**: 90 meters (45 meters on each side of the centerline).  
  - **Length**: 1,034 meters.

- **Transitional Surfaces**: Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal distance) from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces**, extending upward until they intersect with the outer surface.

> These surfaces collectively form a "height envelope" that defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or object near the airport.

#### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all land** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Aklavik Airport, including public road allowances. The exact boundaries of this zone are defined in **Part VI of the schedule** and are based on the **Aklavik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2982**, dated March 23, 1992.

- The **outer boundary** of the regulated area is a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

This means that any land within a 4-kilometer radius of the ARP is subject to the height restrictions.

---

#### **5. Height Restrictions – Prohibited Construction**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing ones) on land subject to these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

- The **approach surfaces**,  
- The **outer surface**, or  
- The **transitional surfaces**.

This ensures that no structure — whether man-made or natural — will obstruct aircraft during critical phases of flight.

> *Note:* The height limits are not absolute; they are defined by the geometric planes described above, which vary by direction and distance from the runway.

---

#### **6. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows to a height that exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or lessee of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

- This provision allows for proactive management of natural elements that could pose a hazard to aviation operations.

---

#### **7. Regulatory Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**, who has the authority to issue orders requiring removal of overgrown vegetation or other non-compliant structures.
- Compliance is mandatory for all landowners and developers within the designated zone.
- The rules are tied to a formal **zoning plan** (E.2982), which provides a visual and technical basis for the spatial boundaries and height constraints.

---

#### **8. Significance and Implications**

- **Safety Focus**: The regulations prioritize aviation safety by minimizing the risk of wind shear, visibility issues, and collision during approach and departure.
- **Environmental Balance**: While imposing strict limits, the rules also recognize the importance of natural growth and allow for management through monitoring and intervention.
- **Local Impact**: The 4-kilometer radius and specific height contours may significantly affect land use planning in the Aklavik area, especially for residential development, forestry, or infrastructure projects.
- **Legal Precedent**: This regulation sets a precedent for how Canadian airports are managed under the Aeronautics Act, emphasizing transparency through public notice and stakeholder engagement.

#### **9. Key Takeaways**

| Element | Summary |
|-------|--------|
| **Legal Authority** | Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act |
| **Applicability** | All land within 4,000 meters of the ARP |

### **Conclusion**

The **Aklavik Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, science-based framework to ensure safe aviation operations at Aklavik Airport. By defining precise geometric height boundaries and clearly outlining the responsibilities of landowners, the regulations balance the need for safe flight operations with practical land use considerations. The inclusion of public consultation, clear definitions, and provisions for natural growth management reflects a thoughtful and legally sound approach to airport zoning in Canada’s remote northern regions.

These regulations remain a key reference for aviation safety planning in the Northwest Territories and serve as a model for similar airport zoning initiatives across Canada.
