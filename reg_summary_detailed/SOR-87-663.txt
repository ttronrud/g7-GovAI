### **Levy Rates (Administration Levy)**

A producer must pay a general administration levy based on how the wood is measured. The levy rate varies depending on the unit of measurement used. The rates are as follows:

| **Apparent Cubic Metres (ACM)** | $0.35 per ACM |
| **Solid Cubic Metres (SCM)** | $0.53 per SCM |
| **Cord of 128 ACM (4 ft × 4 ft × 8 ft)** | $1.27 per cord |
| **Cord of 160 ACM (5 ft × 4 ft × 8 ft)** | $1.59 per cord |
| **Cord of 192 ACM (6 ft × 4 ft × 8 ft)** | $1.90 per cord |
| **Cord of 224 ACM (7 ft × 4 ft × 8 ft)** | $2.22 per cord |
| **Cord of 256 ACM (8 ft × 4 ft × 8 ft)** | $2.54 per cord |
| **Cubic Feet** | $1.50 per 100 cubic feet |
| **Board Measure** | $2.54 per 1,000 board feet |
| **Short Tons (US)** | $0.50 per short ton |

### **Payment Requirements**

1. **General Payment Deadline**:
   - Any producer who sells wood **interprovincially or abroad** must pay the applicable levy to the Syndicate.
   - Payment must be made **within 30 days** after the marketing of the wood.
   - The payment must be made to the **Syndicate’s headquarters in Saint-Eustache, Quebec**.

2. **Payment by the Syndicate (if acting as agent)**:
   - If the Syndicate **markets the wood on behalf of a producer**, it may **deduct the levy directly** from any payment made to the producer (e.g., from a sale or commission).
   - This ensures that the levy is collected even if the producer does not directly receive the proceeds.

3. **Third-Party Marketing (if levy not paid or deducted)**:
   - If a producer fails to pay the levy and the Syndicate has **not deducted it** from a payment made by a third party (e.g., a buyer or exporter), then:
     - Any person who markets that producer’s wood **must deduct the levy from the payment** made to the producer.
     - Within **30 days** of the marketing event, the third party must:
       - Pay the full levy amount to the Syndicate.
       - Provide the Syndicate with a **detailed accounting** of the payment made to the producer and the amount of levy deducted.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- Generate **revenue** for the Syndicate to cover administrative, logistical, and promotional costs related to the **marketing of wood** in interprovincial and export markets.
- Ensure that producers contribute fairly to the **infrastructure and services** provided by the Syndicate, such as:
  - Market access and export facilitation
  - Packaging and grading
  - Transportation and logistics
  - Promotion and trade representation

By linking the levy to the **unit of sale**, the regulation ensures that the cost is proportional to the volume and form of the wood being marketed.

---

### **Key Features and Implications**

- **Flexibility**: The multiple units of measurement allow for compliance with traditional forestry and lumber industry practices (e.g., cords, board feet, tons).
- **Enforcement Mechanism**: The rule that third parties must deduct and remit the levy ensures **non-compliance is not tolerated**, even if the producer fails to pay directly.
- **Transparency**: The requirement for accounting ensures accountability and prevents fraud or evasion.
- **Proportionality**: The rates are designed to reflect the **cost of marketing** and are not excessive relative to the volume or value of the product.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- The Order is authorized under **Section 4 of the Quebec Wood Order, 1983**, which empowers the Syndicate to establish levies on wood producers for interprovincial and export trade.
- It operates under the authority of **Order in Council P.C. 1983-2885**, which created the foundational framework for wood producer levies in Quebec.

### **Conclusion**

The *Labelle Area Wood Producers’ Levy (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order* is a practical, enforceable, and fair mechanism designed to:
- Support the marketing of local wood products beyond Quebec,
- Ensure equitable financial contribution from producers,
- Strengthen the economic viability of the regional forestry sector through coordinated trade efforts.

It reflects a balance between administrative necessity and industry flexibility, with clear rules for payment, enforcement, and accountability. This Order remains a key instrument in the governance of wood trade in the Labelle region of Quebec.
