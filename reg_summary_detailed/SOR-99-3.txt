### 📚 **Key Definitions**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA), the primary legislation governing public service pension benefits. |
| **New Employer** | A person or organization that, through a formal agreement with Her Majesty in right of Canada, assumes the functions previously carried out by a portion of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. This includes any entity acting on behalf of or for the new employer. |

---

### 🚧 **Applicability of the Regulations**
- **Applies to**: A public servant who:
  - Ceases to be employed in the public service due to a transfer agreement between the Government of Canada and a new employer.
  - Becomes employed by that new employer.
- **Exclusions**:
  - **Does NOT apply** to a public servant who later returns to employment with the new employer (i.e., re-employment).
  - **Sections 4 to 9** (which likely cover general superannuation rights or service credit) do **not apply** if the employee has exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the PSSA (likely a transfer option or retirement option).
  - **Sections 12 to 13.01 of the PSSA** (which govern death benefits and survivor benefits) only apply **on and after the date the person ceases employment with the public service**.

---

### 📅 **Key Transitional Provisions**

#### 1. **Return of Contributions (Section 12 & 12.1)**
- **Eligibility**: A person who would have been entitled to a return of contributions under:
  - Subsection 12(3) of the PSSA (return of contributions upon leaving public service), or
  - Subsection 12.1(4) (for certain categories of employees, e.g., those with limited service)
- **Right to Request**: Can request a return of contributions **within one year** of ceasing public service and becoming employed by the new employer.
- **Timing**: The one-year period begins on the **date the person ceases to be employed by the new employer**.

> ⚠️ *Note: This provision ensures that employees who would have otherwise been entitled to a refund of contributions under the PSSA can claim it during a defined window after their transition.*

---

#### 2. **Survivor and Child Benefits**
- **Beneficiaries**: The **survivor** and **children** of a public servant who dies while employed by the new employer are entitled to benefits **as if the individual had remained in the public service**.
- **Available Benefits**:
  - The **death benefit** under:
    - Subsection 12(8) or 12.1(8) of the PSSA (for pension or lump-sum death benefits).
  - The **allowances** under:
    - Subsection 13(3) or 13.001(3) of the PSSA (e.g., dependent allowances).
- **Note**: This provision ensures continuity of family benefits even after a transfer to a new employer.

> 🚫 *Repealed provision*: A prior section (repealed by SOR/2016-203, s. 63) that may have provided similar benefits was removed — the current version replaces it with the above.

---

#### 3. **Child Allowance (for new dependents)**
- **Eligibility**: A child who:
  - Is born to, adopted by, or becomes a stepchild of the employee **during the period** that begins on the day the employee ceases public service and ends on the day they cease employment with the new employer.
- **Benefit**: The child is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the PSSA** (which covers dependents’ benefits).
- **Purpose**: Ensures that children formed during the transition period are not excluded from public service family benefits.

---

#### 4. **Pensionable Service and Age Calculation**
- **Pensionable Service**:
  - Includes **service with the new employer** from the day the person ceases public service until the day they cease employment with the new employer.
  - This service is counted toward pension entitlements under sections 12 to 13.01 of the PSSA.
- **Age for Benefit Calculations**:
  - The age used for determining pension eligibility (e.g., retirement age, pension accrual) is the **age on the day the person ceases to be employed in the public service** — not their age when they join the new employer.

> ✅ This ensures consistency in benefit calculations, treating the transition period as a continuation of public service for pension purposes.

---

### ⏱️ **Effective Date**
- These regulations **come into force on January 1, 1999**.

## 🎯 **Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Ensure Fair Transition** | Public servants transferring from DCI to a new employer are not disadvantaged in terms of pension, survivor, or contribution rights. |
| **Maintain Continuity of Benefits** | Death benefits and child allowances continue to apply during and after the transition. |
| **Provide Clarity on Service Credits** | Service with the new employer is recognized as pensionable service, and age is based on the date of public service exit. |
| **Enable Return of Contributions** | Employees who would have been entitled to a refund under the PSSA can claim it within one year of transition. |
| **Protect Families** | Children born or adopted during the transition period are eligible for dependant allowances. |

---

## 📝 **Important Notes and Exceptions**
- **No Application to Re-employment**: If a person returns to work with the new employer, these regulations do not apply.
- **Exclusion of Sections 4–9**: If an employee has exercised a transfer or retirement option under subsection 3(2), they are not subject to these transitional rules.
- **Repealed Provision**: A previous benefit for children was removed (SOR/2016-203, s. 63), so current rules rely on the updated child allowance under Part I of the PSSA.

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

This regulation establishes a **clear and equitable framework** for public servants who transition from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration to a new employer under a government agreement. It ensures that:

- Pension rights, survivor benefits, and child allowances are preserved,
- Service with the new employer is recognized as pensionable,
- Employees have a defined window to request a return of contributions,
- And families are protected during the transition.

It reflects a balance between administrative efficiency (divestiture of DCI functions) and fairness to employees and their dependents under public service superannuation rules.
