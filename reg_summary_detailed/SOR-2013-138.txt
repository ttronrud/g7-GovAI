**Legal Authority:** Section 134a of the *National Energy Board Act*  
**Approved by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources  
**Effective Date:** Upon coming into force of section 98 of the *Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act*; or, if registered later, on the date of registration

## 📚 1. **Purpose of the Regulations**
These regulations establish a framework for imposing **administrative monetary penalties (AMPs)** on individuals and entities that breach provisions of the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* (Act) or its associated regulations. The goal is to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements related to energy development, safety, environmental protection, and operational standards.

---

## 📂 2. **Definitions and Key Terms**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 98; R.S., c. N-7).
- **"Violation"** is defined broadly and includes:
  - Contravention of specific provisions listed in **Column 1 of Schedule 1**.
  - Breach of any **order or decision** issued under the Act.
  - Failure to comply with any **condition** of a certificate, licence, permit, authorization, leave, or exemption granted under the Act.

> ⚠️ **Discrepancy Resolution**: If there is a conflict between the short-form description in Schedule 1 and the actual provision, the **provision itself takes precedence**.

## ⚖️ 3. **Classification of Violations**

Violations are categorized into two types based on severity and nature:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Type A Violation** | More serious or high-impact breaches (e.g., safety hazards, environmental damage, major non-compliance). |
| **Type B Violation** | Less serious or procedural breaches (e.g., minor omissions, administrative errors). |

> ✅ **Specific Rule**:  
> - Contravention of an **order or decision** under the Act, or  
> - Failure to comply with a **condition** of a certificate, licence, etc.,  
> → is **automatically classified as a Type B violation**.

This classification determines the **penalty amount** under Schedule 2.

---

## 💰 4. **Penalty Structure (Schedule 2)**

The penalty amount depends on:

1. **Type of violation** (Type A or Type B)  
2. **Total gravity value** (calculated based on specific factors)  
3. **Who committed the violation** (individual vs. person other than an individual)

### 🔍 How Total Gravity Value is Determined:
- The total gravity value is calculated by assessing each criterion listed in **Column 1 of the gravity table**.
- Each criterion is assigned a **gravity value** from **Column 2** of the table, depending on the **circumstances** of the violation.
- These values are **added together** to determine the total gravity value.

> Example: A violation involving a safety hazard with repeated non-compliance may receive higher gravity values than a one-time minor error.

> 🔎 *Note*: The gravity values are not fixed—they are applied **in accordance with the facts and circumstances** of each case.

---

## 📝 5. **Service of Regulatory Documents**

The regulations specify how documents required under the Act (e.g., notices, compliance forms, notices of violation) must be served to ensure proper delivery and legal validity.

### For **Individuals**:
The document must be served by one of the following methods:
- Left with the individual personally.
- Left with an **adult member of the same household** at the individual’s **last known address or usual place of residence**.
- Sent via **registered mail, courier, fax, or other electronic means** to the individual’s address.

> ✅ **Service Date**:
> - If left with an adult: **On the day it is left**.
> - If sent by registered mail or courier: **On the 10th day after receipt** (as per postal/courier receipt).
> - If sent by fax or electronic means (non-fax): **On the day of transmission**.

### For **Persons Other Than Individuals** (e.g., corporations, companies):
The document must be served by:
- Left at the **head office or place of business** with an officer or individual who appears to **manage or control** the business.
- Sent by **registered mail, courier, or fax** to the head office or place of business.
- Sent by **electronic means (non-fax)** to **any individual** who is part of the organization (e.g., a named employee or representative).

> ✅ **Service Date**:
> - If left with a manager: **On the day it is left**.
> - If sent by registered mail/courier: **On the 10th day after receipt**.
> - If sent electronically (non-fax): **On the day of transmission**.

> ❗ **Note**: The service of a document is **not complete** until it is properly delivered and the service date is recorded.

## 📎 7. **Key Provisions in Practice**

| Feature | Practical Implication |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Type B Violations** | Common in administrative or procedural breaches; penalties are generally lower than Type A. |
| **Gravity Value Assessment** | Regulators assess each breach holistically—factors like frequency, impact, intent, and prior history matter. |
| **Penalty Determination** | Penalties are not arbitrary—they are tied to a structured, fact-based gravity scoring system. |
| **Service Requirements** | Clear procedural rules ensure fair and accessible delivery of regulatory notices, especially to individuals. |
