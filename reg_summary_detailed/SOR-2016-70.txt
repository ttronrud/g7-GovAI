**Detailed Summary of the Joint Notice Specifying the Prohibition Period for Certain Activities on Georges Bank**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

This Joint Notice is issued under **subsection 141(1)a** of the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act* (the "Act"). It is a formal administrative action jointly authorized by the **Federal Minister** (representing the Government of Canada) and the **Provincial Minister** (representing the Government of Nova Scotia). This cooperation reflects the shared jurisdiction and responsibility between federal and provincial authorities in managing offshore petroleum resources in the Georges Bank area.

The notice is grounded in the legal framework established by the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord*, which was signed to manage the development and protection of offshore petroleum resources in the shared jurisdiction of Canada and Nova Scotia.

---

**Purpose of the Notice:**

The primary objective of this Joint Notice is to **prohibit specific petroleum-related activities** in a designated portion of the offshore area known as **Georges Bank** for a defined period. These prohibitions are intended to:

- Protect the marine environment and ecological integrity of Georges Bank, a sensitive and ecologically rich region;
- Allow for scientific assessment and environmental monitoring of the area;
- Provide time for further consultation, review, and potential development planning under a more sustainable and environmentally sound framework;
- Ensure compliance with the environmental and economic principles established in the Accord.

---

**Scope of Prohibited Activities:**

The following activities are explicitly prohibited during the specified period:

1. **Exploration and drilling** for petroleum;
2. **Production, conservation, and processing** of petroleum;
3. **Transportation of petroleum** produced in the area.

These activities are restricted in the **specific portion of the offshore area described in Schedule IV** to the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*.

Schedule IV identifies the geographic boundaries of the offshore zone in question, which is centered on Georges Bank — a region known for its rich marine biodiversity and important fisheries.

---

**Duration of the Prohibition:**

- The prohibition begins on the **date the Joint Notice comes into force**.
- It ends on **December 31, 2022**.

This creates a **prohibition period of approximately 6 years and 9 months**, from the effective date to the end of 2022.

---

**Effective Date of the Notice:**

- The Joint Notice is **scheduled to come into force on April 15, 2016**.
- However, if the notice is **registered (i.e., officially published and recognized) after April 15, 2016**, then it will take effect on the **day of registration**.

This provision ensures that the notice only becomes enforceable upon formal legal registration, which may account for administrative delays or procedural requirements.

---

**Legal Basis for Prohibition (Subsection 141(3)1):**

The notice is issued pursuant to **subsection 141(3)1** of the Act, which empowers the Ministers to impose temporary prohibitions on petroleum activities in designated offshore areas when deemed necessary for environmental protection, public interest, or for the purposes of the Accord.

This subsection provides the legal authority to suspend development activities, even in the absence of immediate environmental harm, to allow for further study, public consultation, or regulatory review.

---

**Key Provisions and Interpretation:**

- The prohibition applies **only to the specific offshore area defined in Schedule IV** — not to the entire Canadian or Nova Scotian offshore zone.
- The activities prohibited are **not limited to oil and gas extraction** but also include **transportation of any petroleum** produced in the area, which may include pipelines, tankers, or other conveyance systems.
- The prohibition is **temporary and time-bound**, ending on December 31, 2022, after which activities may be resumed under new conditions or with updated environmental assessments.
- The notice is **not a permanent ban**; it is a regulatory measure designed to provide a structured transition period for future decision-making.

**Significance and Context:**

Georges Bank is a biologically and ecologically significant area, home to a wide range of marine species and a vital source of commercial fishing. The 2016 Joint Notice reflects growing environmental concerns and the need for balanced development policies that respect both economic interests and ecological sustainability.

This prohibition was part of a broader policy shift toward **environmental stewardship** and **intergovernmental cooperation** in managing shared offshore resources. It also demonstrated the federal-provincial partnership in addressing environmental risks associated with offshore petroleum development.

---

**Conclusion:**

The Joint Notice Specifying the Prohibition Period for Certain Activities on Georges Bank is a legally binding administrative instrument that:

- Prohibits exploration, production, conservation, processing, and transportation of petroleum in a defined offshore area;
- Is effective from April 15, 2016 (or the date of registration if later);
- Is in effect until December 31, 2022;
- Is grounded in the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act;
- Serves to protect the environment, promote scientific assessment, and support sustainable resource management.

This notice represents a critical step in the regulatory governance of offshore petroleum activities, emphasizing environmental protection and intergovernmental collaboration in Canada’s maritime zones.
