**Detailed Summary of the Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations (S.C. 1999, c. 33)**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

The **Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations** were established under **section 67 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999** (as amended), specifically in response to **subsection 332(1)** of the Act. On **December 11, 1999**, the Minister of the Environment published a proposed version of these regulations in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, providing the public with an opportunity to:

- Submit comments or
- File a **notice of objection** requesting a **board of review** to assess the proposed regulations, including stating the reasons for the objection.

This process ensured transparency and public participation in environmental regulation development.

The regulations were adopted after the **Ministers of the Environment and Health** concluded that the **natural occurrence, properties, and characteristics of minerals and metals in the environment** had been adequately considered. Based on this assessment, the Governor in Council, acting on their recommendation, formally enacted the regulations.

---

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **any substance**, **except living organisms** as defined in **Part 6 of CEPA, 1999**. This means the rules govern **chemical substances** (e.g., pollutants, industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals) that may enter the environment, but do not apply to biological entities such as plants, animals, or microorganisms.

---

### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and scientific consistency, the regulations define four core terms:

1. **Bioaccumulation Factor (BAF)**  
   - *Definition*: The ratio of the concentration of a substance in an organism to its concentration in water, based on **uptake from both the surrounding medium and food**.  
   - *Purpose*: Measures how much a substance builds up in an organism over time through both direct exposure and dietary intake.

2. **Bioconcentration Factor (BCF)**  
   - *Definition*: The ratio of the concentration of a substance in an organism to its concentration in water, based **only on uptake from the surrounding medium** (not food).  
   - *Purpose*: Assesses direct uptake from water or air into organisms, excluding dietary sources.

3. **Half-Life**  
   - *Definition*: The time it takes for the concentration of a substance to decrease by half due to **chemical transformation or degradation** in a specific environmental medium.  
   - *Purpose*: Indicates how long a substance remains in the environment before breaking down.

4. **Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient (Kow)**  
   - *Definition*: The ratio of the concentration of a substance in an octanol phase to its concentration in water in an octanol-water mixture.  
   - *Purpose*: A proxy for a substance’s **lipophilicity (fat solubility)**—a key indicator of its potential to accumulate in fatty tissues of organisms.

### **Criteria for Determining Persistence**

A substance is considered **persistent** if it meets **at least one** of the following conditions:

#### In Air:
- Its **half-life is ≥ 2 days**, or  
- It undergoes **atmospheric transport** from its source to a **remote area** (indicating long-range environmental movement).

#### In Water:
- Its **half-life is ≥ 182 days** (approximately 6 months).

#### In Sediments:
- Its **half-life is ≥ 365 days** (one year).

#### In Soil:
- Its **half-life is ≥ 182 days** (approximately 6 months).

> **Note**: The persistence criteria are environment-specific, reflecting different degradation rates across media.

### **Criteria for Determining Bioaccumulation**

A substance is considered **bioaccumulative** if it meets **at least one** of the following:

1. **Bioaccumulation Factor (BAF) ≥ 5,000**  
   - This indicates significant accumulation in organisms via both water exposure and diet.

2. **Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) ≥ 5,000**  
   - Applies when the BAF cannot be measured using standard methods (e.g., due to lack of test data), but the BCF (direct uptake) is ≥ 5,000.

3. **Logarithm of Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient (log Kow) ≥ 5**  
   - This is a **default criterion** when neither BAF nor BCF can be determined.  
   - A log Kow ≥ 5 implies high lipophilicity, which strongly suggests the substance will accumulate in fatty tissues of organisms.  
   - *Example*: A substance with a Kow of 10,000 would have a log Kow of 4 (since log₁₀(10,000) = 4), so a value of ≥5 (e.g., Kow = 100,000) qualifies.

> These thresholds are designed to identify substances with a high potential to build up in living organisms, which could lead to adverse health effects or ecological harm.

### **Scientific Methodology Requirements**

The determination of whether a substance is persistent or bioaccumulative must be based on:

- **Generally recognized methods** from:
  - The **Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**  
  - Or **other similar international or scientific bodies** (e.g., EPA, WHO, ISO),  
  - **OR** if no such methods exist, then **scientifically accepted methods within the broader scientific community**, taking into account:
    - The **intrinsic properties** of the substance (e.g., chemical structure, stability),
    - The **ecosystem under consideration** (e.g., aquatic vs. terrestrial),
    - And **environmental conditions** (e.g., temperature, pH, presence of other chemicals).

> This ensures that assessments are both **scientifically rigorous** and **contextually relevant**, avoiding overgeneralization.

---

### **Effective Date**

The regulations came into force on **March 31, 2000**.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve as a foundational tool for **risk assessment and environmental protection** under CEPA. By identifying substances that are:

- **Persistent** (last long in the environment), and  
- **Bioaccumulative** (build up in living organisms),

the regulations help prioritize chemicals for further evaluation, regulation, or restriction under CEPA. This is particularly important for substances that may:

- Enter food chains,
- Accumulate in wildlife or humans,
- Lead to toxicity or ecosystem disruption.

The use of **quantitative thresholds** (e.g., 5,000 for BAF/BCF, log Kow ≥ 5) provides a **standardized, science-based approach** to screening chemicals, enabling consistent and comparable evaluations across different substances and environments.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Chemical screening**: Regulators can use these criteria to screen thousands of substances quickly and efficiently.
- **Precautionary principle**: Supports early intervention before harmful effects are observed.
- **International alignment**: The reliance on OECD guidelines ensures Canada’s standards align with global environmental science practices.
- **Public participation**: The notice-and-comment process strengthens democratic accountability in environmental governance.

### **Conclusion**

The **Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations** are a critical component of Canada’s environmental protection framework. They provide clear, science-based criteria to assess whether a chemical substance poses a risk due to its **longevity in the environment** and its **tendency to accumulate in living organisms**. By setting measurable thresholds and requiring adherence to internationally recognized scientific methods, the regulations enhance the ability of regulators and scientists to identify and manage hazardous substances before they cause widespread environmental or health impacts.

These rules remain relevant today and form the basis for subsequent environmental assessments and regulatory decisions under CEPA, including the designation of **prohibited or restricted substances** under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999**.
