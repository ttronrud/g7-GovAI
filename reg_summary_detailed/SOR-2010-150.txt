## 💰 Prescribed Amounts (for Input Tax Credit and Tax Calculations)

These are critical for determining **net tax liability**, especially for **provincial input tax credits (ITCs)** and **taxable supplies**.

### General Rule:
If a person is required to **add or deduct** a specified provincial input tax credit (as per subsection 236.01(1) of the ETA), then:

- The **total amount reasonably attributable** to:
  - Property or services **acquired in or brought into Ontario** → is a *prescribed amount* for Ontario.
  - Property or services **acquired in or brought into British Columbia** → is a *prescribed amount* for BC.
  - Property or services **acquired in or brought into Prince Edward Island (PEI)** → is a *prescribed amount* for PEI.

> The term "reasonably attributable" means the amount can be logically linked to the use or consumption of the property/service in that province.

## 📐 Prescribed Amounts Under Section 284.01 (Formulas)

Three types of prescribed amounts are defined using formulas:

| Formula | Applies To |
|--------|-----------|
| **Amount = A – B** | Where A = specified amount (paragraph 5(1)(a)), B = specified amount (paragraph 5(2)(a)) |
| **Amount = C – D** | Where C = specified amount (paragraph 5(1)(b)), D = specified amount (paragraph 5(2)(b)) |
| **Amount = E – F** | Where E = specified amount (paragraph 5(1)(c)), F = specified amount (paragraph 5(2)(c)) |

> These formulas are used to calculate differences in tax treatment across provinces and for specific reporting periods.

## 📌 Prescribed Amounts for Builders (Tax Collection and Reporting)

### 1. **When a builder is deemed to have collected tax** (under paragraphs 51(1)(e), etc.):
- The **total amounts of tax collected** in:
  - Ontario
  - British Columbia
  - Prince Edward Island  
→ are each a **prescribed amount** for the return.

> This ensures that even if tax is not directly charged, the builder is still accountable for tax collected under certain conditions.

---

### 2. **For specified housing supplies made in each province**:
- If a builder makes specified housing supplies in **Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, BC, or Newfoundland and Labrador**, the **total consideration** for those supplies in each province is a prescribed amount for the return.

> This allows for province-specific tracking of housing supply value and tax implications.

---

### 3. **For Prince Edward Island (PEI) – Special Rules (Post-Oct 1, 2016)**

If a reporting period includes **October 1, 2016**, the prescribed amounts are:

| Scenario | Prescribed Amount |
|--------|-------------------|
| Supplies where tax under 165(1) became payable **before Oct 1, 2016** | Total consideration |
| Supplies where tax under 165(1) became payable **on or after Oct 1, 2016** and **no tax under 165(2)** applies | Total consideration |
| Supplies where tax under 165(2) applies and became payable **on or after Oct 1, 2016** | Total consideration |

> This reflects a **transition in tax rates and rules** in PEI (from 10% to 9% HST) effective October 1, 2016.
