**1. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2025-88 (February 12, 2025)**  
The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2025-88, which was issued on February 12, 2025.  

- **Purpose of the Repeal:**  
  This action effectively nullifies the prior order, which may have previously designated or assigned specific ministerial responsibilities or staff relations authority to another individual or office. The repeal indicates a change in policy or administrative structure, likely to align with updated government staffing or governance arrangements.  
- **Implication:**  
  Any provisions or directives established under P.C. 2025-88 are no longer in force. This may have resulted from a review of the original order’s relevance, redundancy, or incompatibility with current parliamentary staffing practices or ministerial responsibilities.

**2. Designation of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as Minister**  
Under Statutory Instrument 2025-18, the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is officially designated as a "Minister" for the purposes of the *Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act* (PESRA).  

- **Legal Basis:**  
  This designation is made under section of the *Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act*, specifically in the context of defining who holds ministerial authority in relation to employment and staff relations within Parliament.  
- **Scope of Authority:**  
  The designation grants the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons the status and responsibilities of a Minister under the Act. This includes authority to:  
  - Oversee the employment of parliamentary staff;  
  - Make decisions regarding staff appointments, dismissals, and disciplinary actions;  
  - Ensure compliance with employment standards and staff relations policies;  
  - Exercise the powers conferred by the Act in matters involving staff grievances, workplace relations, and human resources management.  
- **Rationale:**  
  This change likely reflects a strategic move to centralize or clarify accountability for staff relations within Parliament. By formally assigning ministerial status to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, the government strengthens the institutional role of that office in managing the employment of parliamentary personnel.  
- **Significance:**  
  This designation enhances the political and administrative weight of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons in relation to internal staff governance, ensuring that staffing decisions are made under a formal ministerial framework rather than ad hoc or informal arrangements.

**3. Context and Implications**  
- The *Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act* governs the employment of staff working in the Parliament of Canada, including clerks, administrative personnel, and support staff.  
- By designating the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as a Minister under this Act, the government ensures that staffing decisions are aligned with broader government policy and accountability standards.  
- This move may also serve to clarify the chain of responsibility in staff management and improve transparency and governance within Parliament.
