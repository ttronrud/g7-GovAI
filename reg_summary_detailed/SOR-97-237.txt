**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Designating the Province of Quebec for the Purposes of the Definition “Applicable Guidelines” in Subsection 2(1) of the Divorce Act

**Legal Authority:**  
Pursuant to **subsection 2(5)a of the Divorce Act** (Canada), which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice) to designate a province as having established comprehensive guidelines for the determination of child support.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This Order formally designates the **Province of Quebec** as the jurisdiction whose **comprehensive child support guidelines** shall be recognized and applied under the federal **Divorce Act**—specifically, for the definition of “applicable guidelines” in **subsection 2(1)** of the Divorce Act.

This designation means that when a child support determination is being made under the Divorce Act, if the parties are residing in or are connected to Quebec, the **Quebec-specific legal framework** will be used to determine child support amounts, rather than relying on the federal guidelines (such as the general child support schedule in the Divorce Act).

### **Key Provisions and Legal Basis**

1. **Designation of Quebec as the Jurisdiction with Applicable Guidelines**  
   The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, officially designates the **Province of Quebec** as the province whose child support guidelines are recognized under the federal Divorce Act. This is a formal recognition of Quebec’s comprehensive and well-developed system for determining child support.

2. **Definition of “Applicable Guidelines” under Section 2(1) of the Divorce Act**  
   Under subsection 2(1) of the Divorce Act, “applicable guidelines” refer to the rules or legal instruments that govern the calculation of child support in a given jurisdiction. This Order confirms that for purposes of the Divorce Act, **Quebec’s laws and regulations** constitute the “applicable guidelines” in cases involving Quebec residents or where the child support issue arises in Quebec.

3. **Laws and Instruments Constituting the Comprehensive Guidelines**  
   The following four legislative and regulatory instruments are recognized as the comprehensive guidelines for child support in Quebec:

   - **An Act to amend the Civil Code of Québec and the Code of Civil Procedure as regards the determination of child support payments**  
     *(S.Q. 1996, c. 68)*  
     This is a foundational statute that modernized and clarified the legal framework for child support in Quebec, integrating principles of equity, financial responsibility, and the best interests of the child into the legal system.

   - **The Regulation respecting the determination of child support payments**  
     *(Order 484-97 of April 9, 1997)*  
     This regulation provides detailed, practical rules for calculating child support payments. It includes formulas, tables, and guidelines for determining amounts based on income, number of children, and other factors. It is a key operational tool used by courts and legal practitioners in Quebec.

   - **Title Three of Book Two of the Civil Code of Quebec**  
     *(S.Q. 1991, c. 64)*  
     This section of the Civil Code establishes the general legal principles governing child support, including the obligation of parents to support their children, the factors to be considered, and the rights of children to financial support. It provides the foundational legal basis for child support obligations.

   - **Chapter VI.1 of Title IV of Book V of the Code of Civil Procedure**  
     *(R.S.Q., c. C-25)*  
     This procedural regulation outlines the rules for how child support claims are processed in courts, including timelines, enforcement mechanisms, and procedures for modifying or terminating support.

### **Legal Effect and Application**

- The designation applies **specifically to cases involving child support** under the Divorce Act.
- It ensures **consistency and fairness** in child support determinations when parties are in Quebec or when the child or parent resides in Quebec.
- It allows courts and family lawyers to apply Quebec’s **more detailed and nuanced guidelines**, which take into account Quebec’s social, economic, and family values, including the importance of parental responsibility and child welfare.

---

### **Effective Date**

- This Order comes into force on **May 1, 1997**.

---

### **Significance and Context**

- This regulation reflects the federal government’s recognition of **Quebec’s unique and comprehensive child support system**, which was developed through extensive legal and social reform.
- Prior to this Order, the federal Divorce Act applied a uniform child support schedule across Canada, but Quebec’s system—based on a combination of civil law principles and detailed procedural rules—was more tailored to the realities of Quebec families.
- By designating Quebec as having “applicable guidelines,” the federal government acknowledges that Quebec’s system is **comprehensive, consistent, and well-suited** to the needs of child support in that jurisdiction.

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a formal and legally binding recognition that the **laws and regulations of the Province of Quebec** constitute the authoritative and comprehensive guidelines for determining child support under the federal Divorce Act when applicable. It ensures that individuals and courts in Quebec can rely on a robust, well-developed, and equitable framework for child support, promoting fairness and consistency in family law matters.

It is a key step in harmonizing federal and provincial family law systems, allowing for greater flexibility and responsiveness to local circumstances while maintaining national legal coherence.
