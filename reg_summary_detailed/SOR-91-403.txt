**Detailed Summary of the AECL Tandem Accelerator Superconducting Cyclotron Complex Remission Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)). This section empowers the federal government to grant remissions (i.e., exemptions or reductions) of customs duties on specific goods under certain conditions, particularly when such goods are essential for national interests or scientific advancement.

**2. Name and Citation of the Order**  
The Order is officially titled:  
**"AECL Tandem Accelerator Superconducting Cyclotron Complex Remission Order"**  
It may be cited as such in legal and administrative references.

---

**3. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., forgive or waive) customs duties** that would otherwise be payable on specific components used in the construction and operation of a **tandem accelerator superconducting cyclotron complex**. This complex is being developed by **Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)**, a leading Canadian institution in nuclear science and technology.

The remission supports Canada’s strategic investment in **scientific research, nuclear technology development, and national energy and medical applications**, such as isotope production for medical diagnostics and treatment.

---

**4. Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies specifically to:  
- **Components** used in the construction of the tandem accelerator superconducting cyclotron complex.  
- These components must have been **imported into Canada** during a defined period:  
  **January 1, 1988, to December 31, 1991**.  

This time frame reflects the period during which AECL was actively procuring and assembling the necessary equipment for the project.

**5. Conditions for Remission**  
The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to two key conditions:

1. **Import Date Condition**:  
   The components must have been imported into Canada **between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1991**, inclusive.  
   → This ensures the remission is tied to a specific phase of the project’s development and procurement.

2. **Claim Deadline Condition**:  
   A formal **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within five (5) years of the date of importation**.  
   → This establishes a clear administrative deadline to ensure timely processing and accountability.  
   → For example, if a component was imported on December 31, 1991, the claim must be filed by December 31, 1996.

---

**6. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The remission is **subject to Section 3** of the Order (not fully detailed in the provided text), which likely outlines general procedural, administrative, or compliance requirements (e.g., documentation, verification, or audit provisions).  
- The Order reflects a **public interest justification**, typical in scientific and technological development, where the government supports innovation and national capability through duty relief.  
- It demonstrates the Canadian government’s role in **fostering scientific infrastructure** through targeted fiscal policy.

---

**7. Key Takeaways**  
- This is a **targeted, time-limited exemption** from customs duties.  
- It applies only to **specific components** of a defined scientific project.  
- It is **not a blanket exemption** and is strictly limited by import dates and claim deadlines.  
- It underscores the importance of **scientific and technological advancement** in national policy, particularly in the field of nuclear and medical isotope research.

**Conclusion**  
The AECL Tandem Accelerator Superconducting Cyclotron Complex Remission Order is a targeted regulatory measure that facilitates the importation of critical scientific components by waiving customs duties. By linking the remission to a specific timeframe and requiring timely claims, it balances fiscal responsibility with strategic national investment in scientific infrastructure. This Order serves as a model for future government support of high-impact scientific projects through duty remission mechanisms.
