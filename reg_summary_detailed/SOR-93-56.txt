### **Detailed Summary of the Marine Mammals Regulations (S.C. 1991, c. 1, s. 12)**

This regulation, issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, revokes several outdated marine mammal protection regulations and replaces them with a new, comprehensive set of rules effective **February 24, 1993**. These regulations govern the **fishing, handling, transportation, and conservation of marine mammals** in Canada, including belugas, narwhals, seals, bowhead whales, and walruses.

The new regulations were introduced to modernize and streamline the management of marine mammal fisheries, improve scientific consistency, and align with evolving conservation standards and Indigenous rights. Importantly, the regulations reflect a shift from strict protection to a balanced approach that recognizes both **Indigenous subsistence rights** and **conservation needs**.

## **I. Revocation of Previous Regulations**

The following regulations are **revoked** and replaced:

1. **Beluga Protection Regulations (P.C. 1980-1355)**  
2. **Cetacean Protection Regulations (P.C. 1982-1790)**  
3. **Narwhal Protection Regulations (C.R.C., c. 820)**  
4. **Seal Protection Regulations (C.R.C., c. 833)**  
5. **Walrus Protection Regulations (P.C. 1980-1216)**  

These were considered outdated due to changes in scientific understanding, Indigenous rights frameworks, and the need for more precise, enforceable rules.

> **Note**: The regulations were fully **repealed in 2018** (SOR/2018-126, s. 2), meaning this 1993 version is now **historical and superseded** by modern legislation. However, this summary provides a detailed analysis of the *original 1993 version* as requested.
