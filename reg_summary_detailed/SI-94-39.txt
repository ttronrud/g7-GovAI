**Detailed Summary of the Atomic Energy Control Board Cost Recovery Fees Remission Order**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**

The **Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB) Cost Recovery Fees Remission Order** is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and the Treasury Board) to make orders that remit (i.e., refund or reduce) certain fees paid under the *Atomic Energy Control Act*.

**Primary Objective:**  
To ensure that individuals or entities who pay licensing or approval fees under the Atomic Energy Control Act are fairly compensated when their licence or approval is revoked, modified, or when the fee structure changes — particularly when such changes result in a reduction or shift in the fee model.

This Order is considered a public interest measure aimed at promoting fairness and reducing financial burden on licensees in response to changes in their operational status or fee arrangements.

### **2. Citation and Definitions**

- **Order Title:** *Atomic Energy Control Board Cost Recovery Fees Remission Order*  
- **Citation:** S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
- **Key Definitions:**  
  All words and expressions used in this Order have the same meaning as defined in the *AECB Cost Recovery Fees Regulations, 1993*. This ensures consistency with existing fee regulations and avoids ambiguity in interpretation.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

The Order applies specifically to:

- **Annual and bi-annual fees** paid under:
  - The *AECB Cost Recovery Fees Regulations*
  - The *AECB Cost Recovery Fees Regulations, 1993*

These are fees collected from individuals or organizations operating under licenses or approvals issued by the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB).

### **4. Remission (Refund) Provisions**

The Order establishes **three distinct scenarios** under which a portion of the fee paid will be refunded to the licensee. In each case, the refund is calculated using a specific formula based on the duration of the fee period and the remaining time after a change or revocation.

---

#### **Scenario 1: Revocation or Change in Licensed Activity**

**When:**  
A licensee pays a fee for a licence or approval and requests:
- Revocation of the licence or approval, or  
- A change in the licensed or approved activity  

**Condition:**  
The request is **approved** by the AECB or a designated officer under:
- The *Atomic Energy Control Regulations*, or  
- The *Uranium and Thorium Mining Regulations*

**Refund Calculation:**  
The Board shall refund the licensee the portion of the fee equal to:

> **(Fee Amount ÷ Number of Days in the Fee Period) × Number of Days Remaining in the Fee Period**

**Key Elements:**
- The "fee amount" is the total fee paid for the licence or approval.
- The "fee period" is the total number of days for which the fee was originally paid (e.g., 365 days for annual, 182 days for bi-annual).
- The "number of days remaining" is calculated from the **day the Board approves the revocation or change** until the end of the original fee period.

**Example:**  
A licensee pays an annual fee of $10,000 (365 days). The Board approves revocation on day 150.  
Refund = ($10,000 ÷ 365) × (215 days) ≈ $5,890

This ensures that licensees are not penalized for changes in their operations or for no longer needing the licence.

---

#### **Scenario 2: Change from Fixed Fee to Hourly Rate Fee**

**When:**  
A licensee pays an annual or bi-annual fee, and the fee structure is later changed to an **hourly rate fee**.

**Refund Calculation:**  
The Board shall refund the portion of the fee equal to:

> **(Fee Amount ÷ Number of Days in the Fee Period) × Number of Days Remaining in the Fee Period as of the day the change occurs**

**Key Elements:**
- The change to an hourly rate implies that the fixed fee is no longer applicable.
- The refund reflects the unused portion of the fixed fee after the transition to an hourly model.
- The "number of days remaining" is counted from the **date of the change** to the end of the original fee period.

**Example:**  
A licensee pays a bi-annual fee of $8,000 (182 days). On day 90, the fee is changed to an hourly rate.  
Refund = ($8,000 ÷ 182) × (92 days) ≈ $4,055

This prevents licensees from being charged for a full fee when they no longer operate under the fixed-fee arrangement.

---

#### **Scenario 3: Reduction in Fee Amount**

**When:**  
A licensee pays a fee for a licence, and the fee is subsequently **reduced** (e.g., due to policy, operational changes, or regulatory adjustments).

**Refund Calculation:**  
The Board shall refund the portion of the fee equal to:

> **[(Original Fee – Current Fee) ÷ Number of Days in the Fee Period] × Number of Days Remaining in the Fee Period as of the day of the reduction**

**Key Elements:**
- The refund is based on the **difference** between the original fee and the reduced fee.
- The "number of days remaining" is measured from the **date of the fee reduction** to the end of the original fee period.

**Example:**  
A licensee pays a $5,000 annual fee (365 days). On day 120, the fee is reduced to $3,000.  
Refund = [($5,000 – $3,000) ÷ 365] × (245 days) ≈ $1,340

This ensures that licensees are not overcharged when a lower fee is applied after the initial payment.

---

### **5. Key Principles Underlying the Order**

- **Proportionality:** The refund is proportional to the time remaining in the fee period. This ensures fairness and avoids overcharging.
- **Transparency:** The formula is clear and mathematically consistent, enabling predictability for licensees.
- **Fairness:** Licensees are not penalized for operational changes, regulatory shifts, or fee restructuring.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** The Board is empowered to process refunds automatically upon approval of a request or change, reducing administrative burden.

---

### **6. Implications and Benefits**

- **For Licensees:**  
  Provides financial protection against unnecessary or unjustified fee retention.  
  Encourages compliance with regulatory changes without fear of financial loss.

- **For the AECB:**  
  Enhances public trust in the regulatory process.  
  Aligns fee recovery practices with principles of fairness and accountability.

- **For the Public Interest:**  
  Promotes equitable access to licensing and supports responsible regulation of atomic energy activities.

---

### **7. Limitations and Exclusions**

- The Order **does not apply** to fees paid under other regulatory regimes or unrelated to AECB licensing.
- It only applies to **annual or bi-annual fees**; it does not cover one-time or project-based fees.
- The refund is only triggered when a **formal request** is made and **approved** by the Board or a designated officer.

### **Conclusion**

The *Atomic Energy Control Board Cost Recovery Fees Remission Order* is a targeted, equitable, and transparent regulatory mechanism designed to ensure that licensees are not financially penalized when their operations change or when fee structures evolve. By refunding a portion of unused or overcharged fees based on the time remaining in the fee period, the Order reflects a commitment to fairness, accountability, and public interest in the regulation of atomic energy activities in Canada.

This Order serves as a critical component of the AECB’s broader framework for cost recovery, balancing the need for revenue with the need to support responsible and responsive licensing practices.
