**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act*, specifically addresses the inclusion of certain shoreline land within a designated property in the community of Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories.

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Issuing Authority**:
   - The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
   - This reflects a formal government process where administrative recommendations are elevated to a binding legal instrument through executive order.

2. **Legal Basis**:
   - The order is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**. This provision typically allows for the inclusion of specific land parcels—particularly those adjacent to water bodies—within a land grant, especially where such inclusion is necessary to ensure access, protection, or cultural significance, or where the land is subject to special management or Indigenous rights considerations.

3. **Subject Property**:
   - The land in question is **Lot 13, Block 12B**, located in the **community of Tuktoyaktuk**, Northwest Territories.
   - This lot is clearly defined and referenced in official land survey records.

4. **Geographic Boundary Specification**:
   - The regulation specifies that **any portion of the land within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of Lot 13, Block 12B, shall be **included in the grant** of the said lot.
   - The "ordinary high water mark" is a standard geographical benchmark used in land surveys and legal descriptions to define the boundary between land and water, typically representing the highest point reached by water during normal tidal conditions (not during floods or storms).
   - This inclusion ensures that the land parcel extends to the immediate shoreline, which may be critical for:
     - Access to water-based activities (e.g., fishing, transportation),
     - Protection of culturally or ecologically significant areas,
     - Compliance with Indigenous land rights or traditional use,
     - Ensuring land tenure clarity for local communities.

5. **Legal Documentation**:
   - The full description of Lot 13, Block 12B is based on a **plan of survey of record number 71296**, held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**.
   - A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District in Yellowknife**, under reference number **1934**.
   - This ensures that the legal description of the land is officially recorded and accessible for future reference, title searches, and land management purposes.

### Purpose and Implications:

- **Clarification of Land Boundaries**: The regulation formally establishes that the shoreline area within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark is part of the granted land, eliminating ambiguity in property boundaries.
- **Potential Indigenous or Community Relevance**: Given that Tuktoyaktuk is a community with strong Indigenous presence (primarily Dene), this inclusion may reflect recognition of traditional land use, access rights, or cultural significance tied to the shoreline.
- **Legal and Administrative Clarity**: By clearly defining the extent of the land grant, the regulation supports land title stability, facilitates future development or management decisions, and ensures compliance with legal standards under the Territorial Lands Act.

### Conclusion:

This regulation is a legally binding directive that expands the boundaries of Lot 13, Block 12B in Tuktoyaktuk by including all land within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark along its shoreline. It is issued under established legal authority, supported by official survey records, and serves to clarify land tenure, likely with implications for Indigenous rights, environmental protection, or community access. The inclusion of the shoreline area ensures that the land grant is both accurate and meaningful in practical and cultural contexts.
