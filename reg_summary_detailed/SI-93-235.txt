Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Revocation and Designation under the National Research Council Act and Financial Administration Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
This regulation is issued under the authority of:
- **Section 2 of the National Research Council Act**, which defines the term "Minister" as the individual responsible for overseeing the National Research Council of Canada (NRC).
- **Paragraph (c.1)** of Section 2 of the **Financial Administration Act**, which defines the "appropriate Minister" with respect to the NRC — the minister designated to exercise authority under financial administration provisions related to the NRC.

The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, thereby reflecting the formal executive power to make administrative appointments and designations within federal government structures.

---

#### **2. Revocation of Prior Order**
- The regulation **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1993-1468**, dated **June 25, 1993**.
- This prior order had likely established a different ministerial designation or administrative arrangement for the NRC.
- By revoking it, the current regulation removes any prior designation or authority that may have been in place, ensuring that the current designation takes effect and replaces outdated or superseded provisions.

---

#### **3. Designation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology**
The regulation formally:
- **Designates the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** as:
  1. A **member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** — this is a formal recognition of the minister’s role in the federal government’s executive and advisory body, granting them the status necessary to act in official capacity on behalf of the Crown.
  2. The **Minister for the purposes of the National Research Council Act** — meaning that this minister is now the official responsible for all administrative, policy, and operational functions of the NRC under the National Research Council Act.

This designation ensures that the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology has the legal and constitutional authority to:
- Approve NRC policies and programs,
- Make appointments to NRC boards or committees,
- Provide funding or oversight,
- Represent the NRC in official communications and intergovernmental relations.

---

#### **4. Designation as the "Appropriate Minister" under the Financial Administration Act**
The regulation also designates the same minister — the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** — as the **appropriate Minister** with respect to the **National Research Council of Canada** under the **Financial Administration Act**.

This designation grants the minister specific financial and administrative powers, including:
- Authority to approve expenditures and budgets of the NRC,
- Power to issue financial directives or directives related to procurement and financial reporting,
- Responsibility for ensuring compliance with federal financial management and accountability standards.

This is critical because the Financial Administration Act governs how federal departments and agencies manage public funds, and the "appropriate Minister" is responsible for overseeing financial accountability and ensuring proper governance.

---

#### **5. Legal and Practical Significance**
- This regulation centralizes responsibility for the NRC under one ministerial portfolio, ensuring clear accountability and coordination between scientific research policy and government financial oversight.
- It reflects a strategic realignment of government responsibilities, likely in response to evolving priorities in science, technology, and innovation policy.
- The designation as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council affirms the minister’s formal standing in the federal executive, enabling them to act with the full authority of the Crown in matters related to the NRC.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation effectively:
- **Revokes an outdated ministerial designation**,
