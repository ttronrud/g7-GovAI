**Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Homelessness Policy Directorate**

**1. Legal Authority and Source**  
This regulation is issued under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of **section 207** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, as amended (S.C. 2003, c. 22), and further referenced in the *Regulations of the Public Service (R.S., c. P-34)*. This provision enables the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer certain public administration functions, including control, supervision, and associated powers and duties, between federal departments and agencies.

**2. Key Provisions of the Regulation**

**A. Transfer of Control and Supervision**  
- The **control and supervision** of the **Homelessness Policy Directorate**—a specific unit within the **Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)**—is being transferred to the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada**.  
- This transfer applies only to the portion of the federal public administration within DESD known as the Homelessness Policy Directorate.  
- The Office of Infrastructure of Canada is a central coordination body within the federal government responsible for overseeing infrastructure-related policies and programs. This transfer reflects a strategic realignment to integrate homelessness policy into broader infrastructure and urban development planning.

**B. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions**  
- The **powers, duties, and functions** that were previously exercised by the **Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** with respect to the Homelessness Policy Directorate are being transferred to the **Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion**.  
- This includes all responsibilities related to policy development, program implementation, interdepartmental coordination, and oversight of homelessness-related initiatives previously managed under the infrastructure portfolio.

**3. Purpose and Implications**

- **Policy Integration**: The move aims to align homelessness policy more closely with broader infrastructure planning and urban development, recognizing that housing and homelessness are deeply linked to transportation, housing supply, community planning, and urban design.
- **Improved Coordination**: By placing the Homelessness Policy Directorate under the Office of Infrastructure of Canada, there is expected to be better coordination between housing, infrastructure, and community development initiatives.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: The Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion, who is responsible for housing equity and inclusion, now has direct authority over homelessness policy, reinforcing a focus on equity, diversity, and inclusive housing solutions.
- **Interdepartmental Rebalancing**: This transfer reflects a shift in governmental responsibility—moving from a traditional infrastructure-led approach to a more integrated, human-centered approach to addressing homelessness.

---

**4. Scope and Limitations**

- The transfer is **specific and targeted**—only the Homelessness Policy Directorate within DESD is affected.
- It does **not** transfer personnel, funding, or operational resources directly; rather, it changes the administrative and policy oversight structure.
- The transfer is **not retroactive** and applies prospectively to future policy, program, and administrative activities related to homelessness under the Directorate.

---

**5. Governance and Accountability**

- The Office of Infrastructure of Canada will now have **operational control** over the Directorate’s activities, including budgeting, staffing, and program delivery (in coordination with the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion).
- The Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion will assume **policy leadership and accountability** for the outcomes of homelessness-related initiatives.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal government. It reflects a strategic effort to address homelessness through a more integrated, infrastructure-informed, and equity-focused policy framework. By transferring the Homelessness Policy Directorate from the Department of Employment and Social Development to the Office of Infrastructure of Canada and assigning its policy responsibilities to the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion, the government aims to strengthen cross-sector collaboration and ensure that homelessness policy is embedded within broader housing and urban development strategies.
