## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Accessible Canada Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 10)**

### 🔹 **1. Purpose and Legal Authority**
- These regulations implement the **Accessible Canada Act (ACA)** to ensure that all regulated entities in Canada provide accessible services, products, and information to persons with disabilities.
- The regulations are issued under **section 91(1)** and **117(1)** of the ACA, which empower the Governor General in Council to make rules necessary for carrying out the Act’s objectives.
- The goal is to promote **accessibility in public and private services**, including digital platforms, physical spaces, and communication processes.

### 🔹 **2. Key Definitions**
The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Accessible Canada Act*. |
| **Band** | Has the same meaning as in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — refers to a First Nations band, including its council and reserve lands. |
| **Employee** | Any person employed by a regulated entity under paragraphs 7(1)(e) or (f) of the Act. Includes dependent contractors (as defined in the Canada Labour Code). <br> **Excludes**: <br> - Persons in student employment programs designated by the employer; <br> - Students employed only during vacation periods. |
| **Planning and Reporting Cycle** | A 3-year period where: <br> - Year 1: Accessibility plan must be published (under sections 47, 56, 65, or 69); <br> - Years 2 & 3: Progress reports must be published (under sections 49, 58, 67, or 71). |

### 🔹 **3. Calculation of Average Number of Employees**
- **Annual average**:  
  Sum of the number of employees in each month when the count is highest, divided by 12.  
  If the result is equidistant between two whole numbers → **rounded up**.

- **Cycle average**:  
  Sum of the three annual averages (from the 3-year planning and reporting cycle), divided by 3.  
  Again, if equidistant → **rounded up**.

> This ensures that small businesses are not unfairly penalized due to fluctuating headcounts.

### 🔹 **4. Exemptions from Accessibility Requirements**

#### A. **Exemptions for Bands (First Nations)**
- Entities or individuals belonging to a **band** (as defined in the Indian Act) are exempt from sections 47–49, 56–58, 65–67, and 69–71 of the Act — **until 4 years before the fifth anniversary** of the regulations coming into force.
- Exemption applies to:
  - Councils of bands;
  - Entities or persons operating undertakings **not within provincial legislative authority** (e.g., on reserve lands or outside provincial jurisdiction).

> This recognizes the unique governance and cultural context of First Nations communities.

#### B. **Exemptions for Small Regulated Entities (Paragraphs 7(1)(e) or (f))**
- Entities with **fewer than 10 employees** during:
  - The year before their first planning and reporting cycle (adjusted for exemption), **or**
  - The year in which the entity was established  
  → Are exempt from accessibility plan and progress report requirements.

- **Exemption duration**:  
  Applies **until the end of the planning and reporting cycle** in which the entity has fewer than 10 employees on average.

- **When exemption ends**:  
  The exemption **ceases** in any year when the entity has **10 or more employees on average**.

> This allows small businesses time to grow and develop accessibility plans without immediate pressure.

### 🔹 **5. Fixed Day for Accessibility Plan Publication**

The "fixed day" is the deadline by which a regulated entity must publish its first accessibility plan.

> For entities established **after** the regulations come into force:  
> Fixed day = **June 1 of the year following establishment**.

> For entities that **cease to be exempt** and have never published a plan:  
> Fixed day = **Later of**:  
> - June 1 of the second year after regulation entry;  
> - June 1 of the first year in which they have **10+ employees** after ceasing exemption.

> This ensures that even newly formed or growing organizations are not left without a timeline.

### 🔹 **6. Applicable Period for Progress Reports**

- **General rule**:  
  The applicable period is **36 months** beginning from the date the last accessibility plan was published.

  After ceasing exemption and having completed at least one full planning and reporting cycle:  
  → Applicable period is **12 months** after June 1 of the first year in which the entity has **10+ employees** after ceasing exemption.
