**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation constitutes a formal **authorization by the Governor in Council** under the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA) to permit **Air Canada**, a parent Crown corporation, to apply for amendments to its **articles of incorporation**. The amendment proposes a **share split**—specifically, a division of the outstanding common shares of Air Canada on a ratio of **125 common shares for every 1 common share**.

This action is not intended to alter the fundamental nature, objectives, or business restrictions of Air Canada as defined in its original articles of incorporation. Instead, it is a structural adjustment to the share capital structure, aimed at improving shareholder value, enhancing liquidity, and facilitating market transparency.

### **Key Legal and Regulatory Background**

1. **Air Canada as a Parent Crown Corporation**  
   Air Canada is designated as a **parent Crown corporation**, meaning it is owned by the Government of Canada and operates under specific regulatory and governance frameworks. As such, it is subject to the provisions of **Part XII of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, which governs the authority and procedures for corporate amendments involving Crown corporations.

2. **Section 101(4) of the Financial Administration Act**  
   This section establishes that **any application for amendments to the articles of a parent Crown corporation must be authorized by the Governor in Council**.  
   - The Governor in Council (acting on the advice of the President of the Queen’s Privy Council) must approve such applications before they can proceed.  
   - This requirement ensures that changes to the corporate structure of a Crown corporation are subject to high-level government scrutiny and oversight.

3. **No Material Change to Objectives or Restrictions**  
   The proposed amendment is **not intended to alter**:
   - The **objects or purposes** for which Air Canada was incorporated;
   - The **restrictions on business activities** or operations permitted under its original articles.  
   Therefore, the change is considered **non-material** and does not affect the core mandate or operational scope of the corporation.

4. **Section 101(6) of the Financial Administration Act**  
   This provision allows the Governor in Council to determine that a Crown corporation is **otherwise empowered to amend its articles** under the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA), provided that:
   - The corporation is legally capable of making such amendments;  
   - The amendment is consistent with its corporate purpose and governance structure.  
   In this case, the Governor in Council has concluded that Air Canada is **legally and operationally empowered** to proceed with the amendment under section 167 of the CBCA.

### **Nature of the Proposed Amendment**

- **Current Share Capital**:  
  Air Canada currently has **329,009 common shares** issued and outstanding.

- **Proposed Share Split Ratio**:  
  A split of **125 common shares for every 1 common share** (i.e., a 125:1 split).

- **Resulting Share Count**:  
  After the split, the total number of common shares will be:
  $$
  \frac{329,009}{125} = 2,632,072 \text{ shares} \quad \text{(rounded to nearest whole number)}
  $$
  However, the regulation explicitly states the result will be **41,126,125 common shares**—this suggests a possible **error or misstatement in the arithmetic**, or that the split is applied differently (e.g., based on a different base or calculation method).  
  ⚠️ **Note**: The stated result (41,126,125) does not align with a simple 125:1 split of 329,009 shares.  
  - 329,009 ÷ 125 = 2,632.072 → ~2,632,072 shares  
  - 41,126,125 × 125 = 5,140,765,625 → far exceeds original share count.  
  → **This appears to be a factual inconsistency or typographical error in the regulation.**  
  ✅ *For accuracy, the proposed split ratio should be verified with official corporate records or supporting documents.*

  **Assumption**: The intended ratio is likely **125:1**, and the resulting number (41,126,125) may be a mistake. A more plausible outcome would be approximately **2.6 million shares**, not 41 million.

### **Governor in Council’s Authorization**

- The Governor in Council has **formally authorized** Air Canada to submit an application to amend its articles of incorporation.
- This authorization is **conditional** upon:
  - Compliance with the provisions of the *Financial Administration Act*;
  - The absence of any material change to the corporation’s original objectives or business restrictions;
  - Confirmation that the amendment is consistent with the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (specifically section 167).

### **Purpose and Implications**

1. **Shareholder Benefits**  
   - Reduces the par value of shares, potentially increasing liquidity and marketability.  
   - Makes shares more accessible to retail investors by lowering the price per share.

2. **Corporate Governance**  
   - Maintains Air Canada’s status as a Crown corporation without altering its strategic or operational mandate.

3. **Transparency and Market Confidence**  
   - A share split can enhance investor confidence by signaling confidence in the company’s long-term performance and financial health.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**  
   - Ensures all changes to corporate structure are properly authorized and documented under federal corporate governance laws.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation authorizes Air Canada to pursue a **share split on a 125:1 ratio** (or a similar ratio) to divide its existing 329,009 common shares into a larger number of smaller shares. The amendment is **non-material** to the corporation’s original objectives and business restrictions, and is permitted under the *Financial Administration Act* due to Air Canada’s legal standing under the *Canada Business Corporations Act*.

However, there is a **significant discrepancy** in the final share count stated (41,126,125), which does not mathematically align with a 125:1 split of 329,009 shares. This suggests a **possible error in the regulation** and should be reviewed by legal or financial authorities before implementation.

### **Recommendations for Review**

1. **Verify the share split ratio and resulting share count** using official financial records or corporate filings.  
2. **Clarify the basis for the 41,126,125 figure**—it may be a typographical error or misinterpretation.  
3. **Ensure full disclosure** to shareholders and stakeholders regarding the purpose, impact, and legal basis of the proposed amendment.  
4. **Confirm compliance** with all relevant sections of the *Financial Administration Act* and the *Canada Business Corporations Act*.

**Final Summary Statement**:  
The Governor in Council has authorized Air Canada to apply for an amendment to its articles of incorporation to effect a share split (likely 125:1), which would increase the number of outstanding common shares. The amendment does not alter the corporation’s core objectives or business restrictions and is permitted under the Financial Administration Act due to Air Canada’s legal capacity under the Canada Business Corporations Act. However, a mathematical inconsistency in the final share count warrants further verification.
