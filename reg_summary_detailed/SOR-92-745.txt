**Detailed Summary of the Public Property Loan Regulations (SOR/83-181)**

---

### **Overview**

On February 17, 1983, the Government of Canada issued *Personal Property Loan Regulations* (P.C. 1983-506) under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act*. These regulations were subsequently **revoked** and replaced by the **Public Property Loan Regulations**, issued under **SOR/83-181**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on page 841. This new set of regulations governs the **lending of public property that is not real property** (i.e., movable assets such as vehicles, equipment, furniture, or other tangible personal property).

The purpose of these regulations is to establish a clear, consistent, and accountable framework for how public institutions can lend public property, ensuring transparency, financial protection, and proper oversight.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **1. Citation and Scope**
- The regulations are officially cited as the **Public Property Loan Regulations**.
- They apply specifically to the **lending of personal (non-real) property** owned by the federal government.
- **Real property** (such as land or buildings) is explicitly excluded from this scope.

#### **2. Definition of "Lending Authority"**
A "lending authority" refers to one of the following:
- An **appropriate Minister** of the Crown, as defined in **section 2(a), (a.1), or (b)** of the *Financial Administration Act*.  
  This includes ministers responsible for departments or agencies that manage public property (e.g., Minister of Finance, Minister of Transport, etc.), depending on the nature of the property.
- A **departmental corporation** — a federally established corporation operating under a department (e.g., a Crown corporation like the Canadian National Railway or the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation).

> This ensures that only authorized and accountable entities can initiate or approve loans of public property.

#### **3. Requirement for Written Contracts**
Every loan of public property must be made through a **written contract** that includes the following essential elements:
- **Description of consideration**: A clear statement of what the borrower is providing in exchange for the use of the property (e.g., a fee, service, or other value).
- **Indemnity clause**: The borrower must **indemnify Her Majesty (the Crown)** and **save Her Majesty harmless** from all losses, claims, or liabilities arising from the borrower’s use or possession of the public property.
  - This protects the government from potential legal or financial exposure due to misuse, damage, or negligence.
- **Inspection rights**: The lending authority must have the right to **inspect the property at any reasonable time** and assess its **state of repair**.
- **Term of the loan**: The duration of the loan must be clearly stated (e.g., 3 months, 1 year).
- **Security requirement**: If the lending authority requires it, the contract must identify any **security** (such as a guarantee, surety, or collateral) that the borrower is required to provide.

> These contractual provisions ensure accountability, risk mitigation, and transparency in the lending process.

#### **4. Emergency Loan Exception**
In cases where an **emergency exists**, a loan of public property may be made **without a full written contract**, provided that:
- The borrower **signs a written acknowledgment of receipt** of the property.
- The lending authority determines that the emergency justifies immediate action (e.g., urgent repairs, disaster response, or operational necessity).

> This provision allows flexibility in crisis situations but requires documentation to ensure accountability.

#### **5. Follow-up Contract Requirement**
If a loan is made under the emergency exception (subsection 2), the lending authority **must enter into a formal written contract** in the form required by subsection (1) as soon as practicable after the emergency has passed.

> This ensures that emergency loans are not permanent and are eventually brought into compliance with standard lending procedures.

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Accountability and Oversight**:  
   The requirement for written contracts and indemnity clauses ensures that both the government and the borrower understand their responsibilities.

2. **Risk Management**:  
   The indemnity and inspection clauses protect the Crown from financial or legal liability due to misuse or damage.

3. **Transparency and Record-Keeping**:  
   All loans are documented, which supports auditability and compliance with financial administration standards.

4. **Flexibility with Accountability**:  
   Emergency provisions allow urgent action while maintaining a requirement for formal documentation later.

5. **Legal Basis**:  
   The regulations are enacted under **section 61 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Treasury Board) to make rules governing the administration of public funds and property.

### **Practical Implications**

- Government departments or agencies wishing to lend items like office equipment, vehicles, or tools must:
  - Identify the appropriate lending authority (e.g., a minister or departmental corporation).
  - Prepare a formal written contract with all required clauses.
  - Ensure the borrower understands and agrees to indemnify the Crown.
  - Allow the lending authority to inspect the property and monitor its condition.

- In emergencies (e.g., natural disasters, sudden operational needs), a temporary loan can be issued with a receipt, but a full contract must be finalized promptly.

- These regulations apply only to **personal property**, not real estate (e.g., land, buildings), which are governed by separate rules.

### **Conclusion**

The **Public Property Loan Regulations (SOR/83-181)** provide a structured, legally sound, and flexible framework for the temporary use of federal public property. By requiring written contracts, indemnity, inspection rights, and clear terms, the regulations balance operational needs with financial and legal protection. The inclusion of an emergency exception ensures responsiveness without compromising accountability. As a key component of federal financial administration, these regulations help ensure that public property is used responsibly and in the best interests of the Crown and the public.
