### **Detailed Summary of the Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolution on Yemen (R.S., c. U-2)**

---

#### **Background and Purpose**

These regulations were enacted by the Governor in Council of Canada, on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, under **Section 2 of the United Nations Act**, to implement **United Nations Security Council Resolution 2140 (2014)** and subsequent resolutions (notably Resolution 2216 (2015)) concerning the situation in **Yemen**.

The primary objective is to **prevent the proliferation of weapons and military support** to armed groups and individuals involved in conflict in Yemen—particularly those who are not legitimate state actors—and to **prohibit transactions with designated persons** who are linked to such activities.

These measures are designed to align Canada’s domestic legal framework with international obligations under the UN Charter, specifically **Article 41**, which allows the Security Council to take action to maintain international peace and security when necessary.
