### **Detailed Summary of the Kugaaruk Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Procedural Context**

The **Kugaaruk Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under the **Aeronautics Act** (R.S., c. A-2), specifically **paragraphs 5.4(2)(b)a and (c)a**, and are enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**.

- A **notice of proposed regulations** was first published in two successive issues of the *Nunatsiaq News* on **February 10 and 17, 2012**, and a copy was published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 19 and March 26, 2011**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (including local communities, landowners, and aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the proposed rules.
- The regulations were finalized and adopted after this public consultation period.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **To ensure the safe operation of Kugaaruk Airport** by preventing development or land use that could interfere with aircraft takeoffs, landings, or flight paths.
2. **To protect aeronautical communications and signal integrity** by preventing any development or natural growth that could interfere with radio, radar, or other communication systems used by aircraft or airport facilities.

These protections are essential in a remote Arctic environment where aviation is a critical mode of transportation and emergency response.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined within the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Kugaaruk Airport, located in the vicinity of Kugaaruk, Nunavut. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | The geometric center of the runway thresholds at coordinates **7,605,223.935 N, 385,471.969 E** (latitude 68°32′09″ N, longitude 89°48′19″ W). Located 823.55 m from the end of runway 05–23’s strip surface, at an elevation of **10.63 m above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined surface extending from each end of the runway (runway 05 and 23) to a horizontal line 2,500 meters horizontally from the end. It rises at a **1:25 gradient** (1 m vertical per 25 m horizontal). |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface extending outward from the ARP in a circular pattern with a **radius of 4,000 meters**. Maintains a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, but **does not fall below 9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip Surface** | An imaginary rectangular surface associated with the runway (05–23), 60 meters wide (30 m on each side), extending from 60 m southwest of threshold 05 to 60 m northeast of threshold 23 (total length: **1,647.10 m**). Elevation varies between **17.70 m** at the 05 end and **8.32 m** at the 23 end. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined surface rising at a **1:5 gradient** (1 m vertical per 5 m horizontal) from the lateral edges of the strip surface and approach surfaces, extending up to where it intersects the outer surface. |
| **Zoning Plan** | Official plan designated **Plan No. E3302**, prepared by the Department of Public Works and Government Services and dated **December 1, 2008**. Serves as the foundational document for the spatial layout of all surfaces. |

#### **4. Geographic Scope and Applicability**

- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Kugaaruk Airport** within a **circular area of 4,000 meters radius** centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This includes:
  - Land **under water**
  - Public road allowances
- The area is defined in **Part 6 of the schedule** and is illustrated on the zoning plan.

> **Note**: All coordinates are in **UTM (Zone 16, 1983 North American Datum)** and elevations are based on the **Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum (CGVD28)**.

#### **5. Prohibited Activities and Restrictions**

The regulations impose strict limitations on land use and development to ensure aviation safety:

##### **(a) Construction or Development Restrictions**
- **No building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing structures) may be placed, erected, or constructed on any of the regulated lands **if any part of it penetrates**:
  - An **approach surface**
  - The **outer surface**
  - A **transitional surface**

##### **(b) Use or Development Restrictions**
- No person may **use or develop** any land **under the outer surface** in a way that causes **interference with signals or communications** to or from:
  - Aircraft
  - Aeronautical service facilities (e.g., radar, radio towers)

##### **(c) Natural Growth Restrictions**
- No person may **permit natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) to grow in a way that **penetrates**:
  - An approach surface
  - The outer surface
  - A transitional surface

##### **(d) Wildlife Activity Restrictions**
- No person may use or permit the use of land for activities that **attract wildlife**, especially **birds**, which could pose a **hazard to aviation safety** (e.g., bird strikes during takeoff or landing).

> **Exception**: Despite these restrictions, a person **may use land for an open water storage reservoir** (e.g., for emergency or seasonal use) for **a period of 48 hours or less**.

#### **6. Elevation and Surface Calculations**

- **Approach Surfaces**:
  - Rise at **1:25 gradient** from the runway end to a horizontal line 2,500 m out.
  - Outer ends of this line are **280 m from the runway centerline** and **100 m above the end elevation**.
  - Elevation at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centerline of the approach surface.

- **Strip Surface**:
  - 60 m wide, 1,647.10 m long.
  - Elevation varies between 17.70 m (at 05 end) and 8.32 m (at 23 end).
  - The centerline is divided into segments with **constant slope ratios** (as specified in Column 7 of the schedule), and elevation is calculated based on these segments.

- **Transitional Surfaces**:
  - Rise at **1:5 gradient** from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces.
  - Elevation at the lower edge equals the elevation of the nearest point on the centerline of the abutting surface.

- **Outer Surface**:
  - Constant elevation of **45 m above the ARP**.
  - However, **does not fall below 9 m above ground** — a safety buffer to prevent dangerous proximity to terrain.

#### **7. Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force** on the day when the requirements specified in **subsection 5.6(2) of the Aeronautics Act** are met.
- As of the date of publication, the regulations were effective **April 2, 2013**.

---

#### **8. Significance and Implications**

- **Safety First**: The regulations are designed to protect the integrity of flight operations in a remote, high-risk environment where visibility, terrain, and weather conditions are challenging.
- **Environmental and Cultural Sensitivity**: By restricting vegetation and wildlife activity, the rules help preserve the natural landscape while ensuring aviation safety.
- **Clear Boundaries**: The use of precise coordinates and defined surfaces allows for enforceable, measurable boundaries and consistent application across land use decisions.
- **Balanced Flexibility**: The 48-hour exception for open water reservoirs provides practical flexibility for emergency or seasonal needs without compromising safety.

### **Conclusion**

The **Kugaaruk Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive, science-based, and safety-focused framework to manage land use around a critical Arctic airport. By defining precise spatial boundaries (approach, strip, outer, and transitional surfaces), restricting development and natural growth, and protecting aviation communications, the regulations ensure the **safe, reliable, and sustainable operation** of Kugaaruk Airport — a vital lifeline for the Inuit community and regional connectivity in Nunavut.

These regulations exemplify how federal regulatory frameworks can balance environmental protection, community needs, and aviation safety in remote and sensitive Arctic regions.
