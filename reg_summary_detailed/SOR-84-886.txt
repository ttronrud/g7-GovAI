**Detailed Summary of the R.C.M.P. Stoppage of Pay and Allowances Regulations**

**Regulation Title:**  
*The R.C.M.P. Stoppage of Pay and Allowances Regulations*  
(These Regulations may be cited as the *R.C.M.P. Stoppage of Pay and Allowances Regulations*)

---

**Legal Authority and Basis:**  
The regulations are made under the authority granted by **subsection 22(3) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act (R.C.M.P. Act)**. This provision empowers the **Treasury Board** to issue regulations that govern specific administrative procedures within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.), including the management of pay and allowances during suspension from duty.

The regulations are adopted **on the recommendation of the Solicitor General**, indicating that legal and policy review has been conducted to ensure compliance with the law and constitutional principles.

---

**Purpose of the Regulations:**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to establish a clear, consistent, and lawful procedure for the **stoppage of pay and allowances** of R.C.M.P. members who are **suspended from duty** under **section 13.1 of the R.C.M.P. Act**.

Section 13.1 of the R.C.M.P. Act provides the legal basis for suspending a member from duty—typically due to misconduct, failure to perform duties, or other disciplinary reasons. This regulation ensures that such suspensions are accompanied by a defined financial consequence: the suspension of pay and allowances during the period of suspension.

---

**Who Has Authority to Issue the Order?**  
The following officials may issue an order for the stoppage of pay and allowances:

- The **Commissioner** of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  
- A **Deputy Commissioner**  
- An **Assistant Commissioner**

These officials are authorized to act on behalf of the Commissioner and are responsible for enforcing disciplinary measures, including financial sanctions, in accordance with the R.C.M.P. Act and these regulations.

---

**Scope of the Stoppage:**  
The stoppage applies to the **pay and allowances** of a member who is suspended from duty under section 13.1 of the R.C.M.P. Act. This includes:

- Basic salary  
- Allowances (e.g., housing, transportation, subsistence, or other benefit allowances)  
- Any other monetary benefits or entitlements directly tied to active duty

The stoppage is not a penalty in itself but a procedural consequence of suspension, intended to ensure that members who are not actively performing duties do not receive financial benefits during that period.

---

**Key Principles and Implications:**  
1. **Procedural Clarity:** The regulations provide a clear legal framework for when and how pay and allowances are suspended, reducing ambiguity in disciplinary processes.  
2. **Legal Accountability:** The requirement that the Treasury Board act on the Solicitor General’s recommendation ensures that the regulations are consistent with broader legal and administrative standards.  
3. **Disciplinary Consistency:** The stoppage of pay serves as a measure to maintain discipline and accountability within the R.C.M.P., reinforcing the seriousness of suspension.  
4. **Financial Protection for the Crown:** It prevents the R.C.M.P. from incurring financial losses due to the continued payment of benefits to members who are not performing their duties.  
5. **Fairness and Due Process:** While pay is stopped, the regulations must be applied in a manner consistent with the principles of fairness, transparency, and due process as required under Canadian administrative law.

---

**Limitations and Exclusions:**  
- The regulations do not apply to members who are suspended for medical or administrative reasons unless such suspension is also governed by section 13.1.  
- The regulations do not cover the reinstatement of pay or allowances after suspension.  
- The regulations do not override the rights of a member to appeal the suspension or the decision to stop pay, which may be subject to internal review or judicial review under applicable human rights or administrative law provisions.

---

**Enforcement and Oversight:**  
- The regulations are enforceable by the R.C.M.P. administrative structure.  
- The Treasury Board, as the overseeing body, retains ultimate responsibility for the integrity and legality of the regulations.  
- The Solicitor General’s role in recommending the regulations ensures that legal and constitutional considerations are properly addressed.

**Conclusion:**  
The *R.C.M.P. Stoppage of Pay and Allowances Regulations* provide a legally grounded, administratively sound mechanism for suspending the financial benefits of R.C.M.P. members who are suspended from duty under section 13.1 of the R.C.M.P. Act. By clearly defining who can issue such orders and under what circumstances, the regulations promote consistency, accountability, and the rule of law within the R.C.M.P. disciplinary framework. They serve both as a financial deterrent and a procedural safeguard within the organization’s internal governance structure.
