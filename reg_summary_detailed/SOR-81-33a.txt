**Detailed Summary of the Part-time Work Exclusion Approval Order (Effective January 1, 1981)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation, known as the *Part-time Work Exclusion Approval Order*, was enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the **Public Service Commission (PSC)**. Its primary purpose is to **exclude certain part-time employees from the scope of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**, thereby simplifying employment administration and aligning it with practical workforce needs.

The decision was based on two key findings:

1. **Practicality and Best Interests of the Public Service**:  
   It is not practicable — and is not in the best interests of the Public Service — to apply the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act to individuals who are **not ordinarily required to work more than one-third of the normal scheduled daily or weekly hours** of work for employees doing similar jobs. This group includes many part-time staff whose roles are inherently limited in duration or intensity.

2. **Continuity and Transition for Existing Part-time Employees**:  
   The PSC also concluded that it would not be practical or beneficial to extend the full employment protections of the PSEA to part-time workers who:
   - Are **ordinarily required to work more than one-third** of the standard hours (i.e., they are not minimal part-timers),
   - But **do not exceed 15 hours per week**.

This exclusion ensures that these specific part-time workers remain outside the comprehensive employment framework of the PSEA, which otherwise would apply to all public servants, regardless of work hours.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

#### 1. **Revocation of Prior Orders and Regulations**
The Order formally **revokes two previous legal instruments**:
- The **Part-time Employees Exclusion Approval Order, C.R.C., c. 1350**
- The **Part-time Employment Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1351**

These were previously used to exclude certain part-time employees from the PSEA. Their revocation means that these outdated rules are no longer in force.

#### 2. **Establishment of a New Exclusion Framework**
In their place, the Order establishes a **new, targeted exclusion** from the Public Service Employment Act for the following categories of employees:

| Category | Criteria |
|--------|---------|
| **Category A** | Persons who are **not ordinarily required to work more than one-third** of the normal scheduled daily or weekly hours of work established for persons doing similar work. |
| **Category B** | Persons who were previously employed under the old exclusion orders (C.R.C., c. 1350 and c. 1351) and who are: <br> - Ordinarily required to work **more than one-third** of the standard hours, <br> - But **not more than 15 hours per week**. |

> This means that these individuals are **exempt from the full application of the Public Service Employment Act**, including provisions related to:
> - Employment standards (e.g., minimum wage, working conditions)
> - Promotion and advancement rights
> - Job security and notice requirements
> - Collective bargaining rights (to the extent governed by other laws)

#### 3. **Approval by the Public Service Commission**
The exclusion is **approved by the Public Service Commission**, which has determined that:
- Applying the full PSEA to these part-time workers would be **unrealistic or administratively burdensome**.
- The current workforce structure, particularly in roles with limited hours, benefits from **flexibility** and **simplified management**.
- The exclusion **does not undermine fairness or equity** in the public service, as it applies only to those whose work is inherently limited in scope and duration.

### **Effective Date**
The new Order comes into force on **January 1, 1981**. This marks a transition period where:
- All existing part-time employees falling under the defined categories are now governed by the new exclusion.
- Any new part-time appointments after this date will be subject to the updated rules.

---

### **Legal Authority**
The Order is issued under two specific sections of the **Public Service Employment Act**:
- **Section 39**: Allows the Governor in Council to revoke existing orders and make new ones based on recommendations from the Public Service Commission.
- **Subsection 35(1)**: Grants authority to revoke and replace existing regulations with new ones.

### **Citation and Title**
The Order is officially cited as:  
**The Part-time Work Exclusion Approval Order, C.R.C., c. 1350**

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Workforce Flexibility**  
   Enables the Public Service to hire and manage part-time workers efficiently, especially in temporary, seasonal, or specialized roles where full-time commitments are not feasible.

2. **Administrative Efficiency**  
   Avoids the need to apply complex employment standards (e.g., leave, promotion, pay equity) to part-time staff with minimal workloads.

3. **Clarity and Consistency**  
   Replaces ambiguous or outdated rules with a clear, defined exclusion based on objective criteria (e.g., hours worked, comparison to similar roles).

4. **Equity Considerations**  
   While excluding certain workers from the PSEA, the policy maintains a balance by ensuring that only those with very limited workloads are affected — protecting the interests of employees who work substantial hours (e.g., over 15 hours/week).

5. **Precedent for Future Policy**  
   Sets a precedent for future decisions on employment classifications, particularly in managing workforce diversity and flexibility within the public service.

### **Conclusion**

The *Part-time Work Exclusion Approval Order* of 1981 represents a **pragmatic and targeted adjustment** to the Public Service Employment Act. It removes the full application of employment protections from part-time workers who work fewer than one-third of the standard hours or up to 15 hours per week, recognizing that such roles do not require the same level of employment safeguards as full-time positions. By revoking outdated regulations and establishing a new, clearly defined exclusion, the Order enhances operational efficiency while maintaining fairness and administrative feasibility within the public service.

This regulation remains a foundational piece of policy in Canada’s public service employment framework, particularly in understanding how part-time work is managed and governed under federal employment laws.
