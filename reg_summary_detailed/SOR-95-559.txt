**Detailed Summary of the Fort Liard Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The Fort Liard Airport Zoning Regulations are a formal regulatory instrument enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada. Specifically:

- The proposed regulations were **published in two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I** on **August 12 and 19, 1995**, and in two issues of the local newspaper *Deh Cho Drum* on **August 3 and 10, 1995**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, local communities, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on that public consultation and recommendations, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the advice of the Minister of Transport, **formally enacted** the regulations pursuant to **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.

> *Legal Basis*:  
> - Section 5.5 of the Aeronautics Act (provisional publication)  
> - Section 5.4 (final adoption and enforcement of regulations)

### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Title**: *Fort Liard Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1; S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10  
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to **all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of Fort Liard Airport**, including public road allowances.

> The specific area is defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**, which outlines the geographic boundaries of the regulated zone.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used in determining airspace and land use restrictions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Fort Liard Airport, located near Fort Liard, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point on the centerline of runway 02–20, located **457.2 meters from the threshold of runway 02**. It serves as the origin for all measurements. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing surface, including the runway, designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. For this airport, it is associated with **runway 02–20**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the strip (runway ends), designed to ensure safe aircraft approaches. Each has a **1:25 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 25 meters horizontal). They rise to a horizontal line **2,500 meters** from the runway end, **100 meters above the elevation at the runway end**, with outer ends **280 meters** from the centerline. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal), extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces until they intersect with the outer surface. These ensure safe transition from ground to the outer surface. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane located **45 meters above the elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)**, extending to the outer boundary of the regulated zone. However, if this plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to ensure practicality and safety. |
| **Elevation of ARP** | Fixed at **215.2 meters above sea level**. All other elevations in the regulation are referenced from this point. |

### **4. Core Prohibitions – Land Use Restrictions**

**No person may:**

- Erect, construct, or build any **structure, building, or object** (including additions to existing structures) on land subject to these regulations, **if the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This means that any structure (e.g., houses, towers, wind turbines, trees, or poles) must remain **below the elevation limits** defined by these three surfaces.

---

### **5. Exception for Natural Growth**

- **Natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, grass) that grows on regulated land and **exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces** (approach, outer, or transitional) may be subject to intervention.
- If such growth exceeds the limits, the **Minister of Transport may issue a requirement** that the **owner or lessee of the land remove the excess growth**.

> This provision ensures that even natural elements do not compromise aviation safety, especially during approach and landing phases.

---

### **6. Geographical Boundaries of the Regulated Zone**

The entire area subject to these zoning regulations is bounded by a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

- This circle defines the **outer boundary** of the regulated land area.
- The regulations apply **within and adjacent to** this circle, including public roads and private land.

> This creates a **clear spatial boundary** for land use, ensuring that development or structures are not allowed beyond a safe distance from the airport.

---

### **7. Visual and Technical Reference**

All surfaces and boundaries are based on the **Fort Liard Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3047**, dated **March 30, 1995**, which includes:

- The location of the airport reference point  
- The detailed descriptions of approach, transitional, and outer surfaces  
- The dimensions of the strip (60 meters wide, 1,034.4 meters long)  
- The outer boundary (4,000-meter radius)

This plan serves as the **technical blueprint** for the regulation and is referenced throughout the document.

### **8. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure the safety of aircraft operations** during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- To **prevent interference** with flight paths due to obstructions (buildings, trees, terrain features).
- To establish **clear, enforceable limits** for land development near the airport.
- To provide **predictable and transparent zoning rules** for landowners and developers.

These measures are essential for maintaining **aviation safety standards** in a remote northern location like Fort Liard, where air transport is a critical link for connectivity and emergency services.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Require removal of excess natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with the elevation limits.
- The regulations are **binding and enforceable** under Canadian aviation law.
- Violations could result in **fines, removal orders, or other legal actions** by the Department of Transport.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Fort Liard Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, safety-focused framework for land use around Fort Liard Airport. By defining precise elevation limits through approach, transitional, and outer surfaces, and by setting a 4,000-meter radius boundary, the regulations ensure that all structures and natural growth remain within safe limits for aircraft operations.

These regulations reflect a balance between **aviation safety**, **local land use**, and **community development**, particularly in remote and sparsely populated regions of the Northwest Territories.

---

**Key Takeaways**:
- All structures must be below the **approach surfaces**, **outer surface**, or **transitional surfaces**.
- Natural growth exceeding these limits must be **removed by the landowner**.
- The regulated area extends **4,000 meters from the ARP**.
- The rules are based on a **technical zoning plan** approved in 1995.
- Public consultation was conducted prior to final adoption.

This regulation remains a foundational piece of aviation safety policy in northern Canada.
