---

## **Purpose and Strategic Rationale**

This transfer was designed to achieve several key objectives:

1. **Improved Service Delivery**  
   - Placing operational and service delivery functions under HRSD (which oversees human capital and skills development) ensures better alignment with workforce planning and service efficiency.

2. **Enhanced Identity Management**  
   - Moving identity-related functions (e.g., e-passport, security, policy, complex cases) to **DCI** aligns them with the broader goals of citizenship, immigration, and identity verification.

3. **Streamlined Governance and Accountability**  
   - Clearer lines of responsibility between departments reduce overlap and improve oversight.

4. **Operational Efficiency**  
   - Regional HR and IT units being transferred to HRSD allows for more consistent, standardized, and scalable support across Canada.

5. **Modernization of Passport Services**  
   - The inclusion of the **e-Passport project team** and **Enterprise Alignment and Innovation Bureau** under DCI signals a commitment to digital transformation and innovation in identity services.

## **Key Exclusions and Exceptions**

- **Regional HR Units** → Remain with DFAT (transferred to HRSD only in the *regional* capacity, not central).
- **Regional IT Units** → Remain with DFAT (transferred to HRSD only in the *regional* capacity).
- **Official Travel Section** and **Certificate of Identity Section** → Remain with DCI (not transferred to HRSD).
- **Central Operations Division** → Partially transferred; only certain sections retained in DCI.

> These exceptions indicate that certain high-level or specialized functions (e.g., official travel, identity certificates) are retained in DFAT due to their unique policy or diplomatic implications.

## **Implications and Impact**

| Area | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Citizenship and Immigration** | Gains full control over identity and passport services, including policy, security, and e-passport systems. |
| **Human Resources and Skills Development** | Gains direct operational and regional HR/IT oversight, enabling better workforce planning and regional service delivery. |
| **Interdepartmental Coordination** | Requires new coordination mechanisms between DCI and HRSD, especially around data sharing, security, and policy alignment. |
| **Public Service Efficiency** | Expected to reduce duplication, improve response times, and enhance service consistency across Canada. |

---

## **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **major restructuring** of Passport Canada, shifting responsibilities to align with the core mandates of the receiving departments:

- **DCI** takes leadership of **identity, policy, security, and innovation** in passport services.
- **HRSD** takes over **operational delivery, regional HR, and regional IT**, ensuring human capital and technological support are better matched to regional needs.

This realignment was a strategic move to modernize Canada’s identity services, improve service quality, and ensure that passport operations are more responsive, secure, and efficient in a digital age.

> **Final Note**: This transfer is a classic example of a *public service realignment* under the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, enabling the federal government to optimize administrative structures without altering the scope of service or requiring new legislation.
