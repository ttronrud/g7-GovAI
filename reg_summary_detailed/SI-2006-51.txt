**Summary:**

This regulation formally transfers administrative control and supervision of a specific component of the federal public service from the **Privy Council Office (PCO)** to the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)**.

Specifically, the transfer involves the **Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat**, which is a unit within the **Plans and Consultation Group** of the Privy Council Office. The Plans and Consultation Group traditionally handles strategic planning, intergovernmental coordination, and policy development for the federal government.

The Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat had previously operated under the oversight of the Privy Council Office, where it was responsible for advising the federal government on Indigenous affairs, coordinating policy development related to Aboriginal peoples, and supporting the implementation of federal policies in consultation with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities.

**Key Elements of the Transfer:**

1. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**  
   The regulation establishes that, effective April 1, 2006, the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** assumes full responsibility for the management, direction, and oversight of the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat. This includes administrative, operational, and policy-related functions.

2. **Functional Significance:**  
   The transfer reflects a strategic realignment of federal responsibilities to ensure that Indigenous affairs are managed within a department specifically dedicated to Indigenous and northern development. This move strengthens the integration of Indigenous policy within the broader framework of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, which is responsible for programs, services, and governance related to Aboriginal peoples and northern communities.

3. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign responsibilities within the federal public service, including the transfer of units between departments, provided it serves public interest and administrative efficiency.

4. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **April 1, 2006**, marking a formal administrative shift in the structure of federal governance related to Aboriginal affairs.

**Implications and Context:**

- This transfer was part of broader efforts in the early 2000s to centralize and strengthen federal policy development and implementation related to Indigenous peoples.
- It aligns with the growing recognition of the need for specialized, dedicated departments to manage complex and culturally sensitive issues affecting Aboriginal communities.
- The move may have also been intended to improve coordination between policy development and on-the-ground implementation, as the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat now operates under a department with direct responsibility for delivering services and programs to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative restructuring within the Canadian federal government. By transferring the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, the government reinforced the department’s role as the central body responsible for Indigenous policy and programming. The transfer enhances accountability, ensures continuity in Indigenous affairs policy, and supports more effective and culturally appropriate governance of Aboriginal communities. It stands as a key step in the evolution of federal Indigenous policy in Canada during the early 2000s.
