### **Scope of Remission (Tax Relief)**

The regulation grants **remission (i.e., exemption or refund)** of specific duties and taxes on alcoholic beverages sold to visiting forces and their personnel. The remission applies **subject to Section 4**, which likely contains conditions or limitations (e.g., eligibility, compliance, or administrative requirements).

#### 1. **Customs and Excise Duties (pre-2003)**
> *Remission is granted of:*
> - Customs duties and additional duties equal to excise duties imposed under the **Customs Tariff**,  
> - And taxes under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**  
> *in respect of spirits, wine, or imported beer sold to visiting forces or visiting forces personnel.*

> **Note**: This applies to **all alcoholic beverages** (spirits, wine, beer) and covers both **customs duties** and **excise taxes** that would otherwise be payable by a liquor board.

#### 2. **Excise Duties under the Excise Act, 2001 (post-July 1, 2003)**
> *Remission is granted of excise duties imposed under the Excise Act, 2001*  
> - That are paid or payable **on or after July 1, 2003**,  
> - By a **liquor board**  
> - In respect of **spirits or wine** sold to visiting forces or visiting forces personnel.

> This reflects a **modernization** of the policy to align with the 2001 Excise Act, which replaced the older Excise Act.

#### 3. **Excise Duties on Beer (Brewed in Canada)**
> *Remission is granted of:*
> - Excise duties imposed under the *Excise Act* (paid by a brewer licensed under that Act),  
> - And taxes under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**  
> *in respect of beer brewed in Canada and sold to visiting forces or visiting forces personnel.*

> This ensures that Canadian brewers are not required to pay excise duties when supplying beer to visiting forces or personnel.

### **Conditions for Remission**

Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to the following **mandatory conditions**:

#### **Condition 1: Purchase Price and Reimbursement**
- The **purchase price** paid by visiting forces or visiting forces personnel **must not include** any amount for the duties or taxes being remitted.
- **If the purchase price does include** such duties or taxes, then:
  - The amount must be **reimbursed or credited** to the visiting forces or visiting forces personnel.

> This ensures that the financial burden of the duties/taxes is not passed on to the end users (the forces or personnel).

#### **Condition 2: Documentation and Claims Process**
A claim for remission must be submitted to the appropriate minister and supported by **documentary evidence**. The claim must be made by either:
- A **liquor board**, or
- A **brewer licensed under the Excise Act**

The required documentation includes:

##### For **visiting forces**:
- A **written statement**, signed by:
  - The **unit commander** of the visiting force, or
  - A person **authorized by the commander**,  
  stating that:
  - The alcoholic beverages are for the **sole use of the visiting forces**, or  
  - For **resale to visiting forces personnel**.

##### For **visiting forces personnel**:
- A **written statement**, signed by the **member of the visiting force**, stating that:
  - The alcoholic beverage is for **personal consumption**,  
  - And will **not be resold, given as a gift, or otherwise distributed**.

> This ensures transparency and prevents misuse or unauthorized resale of the beverages.
