**Detailed Summary of the National Farm Products Marketing Council (NFPMC) General Rules of Procedure (1982)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

The *Rules of Procedure of the National Farm Products Marketing Council* were enacted under **Section 10 of the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act (S.C. 1970–71–72, c. 65)**. These rules were developed to establish a structured, transparent, and efficient system for conducting public hearings before the Council.

The primary objectives guiding the creation of these rules are:

1. **Ensure high-quality decision-making** by ensuring hearings are focused, well-informed, and of sufficient depth.
2. **Promote transparency and public awareness** by enabling signatories to national marketing plans (under Federal-Provincial Agreements) to understand and respond effectively to Council concerns.
3. **Facilitate public participation** through accessible, informal, yet formalized processes that allow meaningful public input.
4. **Enhance the ability of interveners** (interested parties) to participate meaningfully and with adequate information.
5. **Minimize delays** in the regulatory process by establishing clear timelines and procedural mechanisms.

These rules apply to all proceedings before the Council that are initiated under **Section 8 of the Act**—i.e., hearings conducted in response to applications or complaints.

- Any party (applicant or intervenor) may request an **expedited hearing**.
- The Council may grant such an order if it deems it appropriate.
- Upon issuance of an expedited order:
  - Oral evidence may **not** be presented unless the Council specifically allows it.

- If a party fails to file a reply within the required time, the hearing may proceed **without notice** to that party.

- If the parties cannot agree, the Council will **settle the issues** either:

> This ensures that hearings are not conducted on vague or undefined factual disputes.

#### **13. Legal Questions and Pre-Hearing Decisions**

  - Make **written submissions** on matters such as:
    - Clarifying or simplifying issues.
    - Amending applications or submissions.
    - Deciding on the admissibility of facts or documents.
    - Determining procedures for evidence.
    - Arranging mutual exchange of documents and exhibits.

#### **15. Document Inspection and Production**
- Any party may, at any time before the hearing, give written notice to another party to:
  - Inspect a document referenced in their application, reply, intervention, or response to an interrogatory.
  - Make copies of the document.
- If the party fails to comply with the notice within **10 days**, they may **not introduce the document as evidence** unless the Council permits it.

> This promotes transparency and ensures all parties have access to relevant information.

#### **16. Enforcement of Procedures**
- Unless otherwise specified, **production of documents and attendance of witnesses** are enforced in the same manner as in the **Federal Court of Canada**.
