**Detailed Summary of the *Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador Additional Fiscal Equalization Offset Payments Regulations***  
*(S.C. 2005, c. 30, s. 85; as amended and interpreted under SOR/2010-174)*

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **Section 33 of the *Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador Additional Fiscal Equalization Offset Payments Act*** (the "Act").  

The purpose of these regulations is to **establish the rules and procedures** governing the calculation, determination, and payment of **additional fiscal equalization offset payments** to the provinces of **Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador**.

These payments are designed to provide financial support to these provinces during specific fiscal years, particularly to help offset the impact of higher per capita net debt, which may affect their ability to manage public finances equitably within the Canadian fiscal equalization framework.

---

### **2. Scope and Applicability**

- The regulations apply to **additional fiscal equalization offset payments** that may be made to **Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Labrador** under the Act.
- The period covered is from **April 1, 2009, to March 31, 2020**, inclusive.
- The regulations do **not apply** to Yukon, the Northwest Territories, or Nunavut — these are excluded from the definition of "province" in this context.

> **Note**: The term "provincial and territorial general government sub-sector" refers to the official classification used by **Statistics Canada** in its Financial Management System (FMS), which categorizes government finances for fiscal reporting and analysis.

> **Important Note**: The definition of "provincial general government sub-sector" was **repealed** by *SOR/2010-174, s. 1*, meaning it is no longer in force. The current definition uses the broader "provincial and territorial general government sub-sector."

### **3. Key Definition: Per Capita Net Debt (for Paragraph 12(1)(b) of the Act)**

For the purpose of determining eligibility and the amount of an additional fiscal equalization offset payment, the regulations define **"per capita net debt"** as of **March 31, 2012**, using the following formula:

$$
\text{Per Capita Net Debt} = \frac{(A + B + C - D)}{E}
$$

Where:

- **A** = Total liabilities (as of March 31, 2012) in the **"liabilities"** category of the provincial and territorial general government sub-sector, as reported by Statistics Canada.
- **B** = Total liabilities (as of March 31, 2012) in the **"other liabilities"** category, as reported by Statistics Canada.
- **C** = Total liabilities to pension plans (as of March 31, 2012), as reported by Statistics Canada.
- **D** = Total financial assets (as of March 31, 2012) in the same sub-sector, as reported by Statistics Canada.
- **E** = The **population of the province on July 1, 2011**, as the **last estimate published by Statistics Canada** prior to calculating the value of A.

> This formula computes the **net debt per person** in the province by subtracting financial assets from total liabilities and dividing by population. It is used to assess the relative financial burden of each province.

This per capita net debt metric is central to the Act’s mechanism for determining whether an additional offset payment should be made and how large it should be.

### **4. Payment Timelines**

#### **For all fiscal years except April 1, 2012:**
- The Minister must **pay the additional fiscal equalization offset payment** to Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Labrador **within 30 days** of determining the amount under the Act.

#### **For the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2012 (special rule):**
- The payment must be made within **30 days of the later of two events**:
  1. The day on which the Minister determines the amount of the payment (based on the formula above); and  
  2. The day on which:
     - For **Nova Scotia**: Statistics Canada determines the values of A, B, C, and D (the liability and asset categories) under subsection 2.1(1) of the Act; or  
     - For **Newfoundland and Labrador**: **All provinces have released their Public Accounts** for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012.

> This delay in payment for 2012 reflects the need for **data availability and inter-provincial transparency** in the financial reporting process. It ensures that the calculation is based on finalized, reliable data.

---

### **5. Enforcement and Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Statutes of Canada* (i.e., when officially published and registered in the Canada Gazette).

---

### **6. Key Implications and Purpose**

These regulations serve several important functions:

1. **Financial Accountability**: They ensure that fiscal equalization payments are based on transparent, standardized, and data-driven metrics — specifically, per capita net debt derived from official Statistics Canada financial data.

2. **Equity in Fiscal Support**: By linking payments to the level of per capita net debt, the system aims to support provinces facing greater financial strain due to structural debt or pension obligations.

3. **Administrative Clarity**: The rules provide clear timelines and definitions for the Minister of Finance, enabling consistent and predictable administration of payments over a 10-year period (2009–2020).

4. **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The reliance on Statistics Canada data ensures objectivity and comparability across provinces and over time.

5. **Inter-Provincial Fairness**: The requirement that all provinces release their Public Accounts in 2012 ensures that the calculation for Newfoundland and Labrador is not biased or incomplete.

### **Conclusion**

These regulations establish a **transparent, data-based, and time-bound framework** for determining and disbursing additional fiscal equalization offset payments to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. By anchoring the payments in per capita net debt and aligning payment timing with the availability of official financial data, the regulations promote fairness, accountability, and consistency in Canada’s fiscal equalization system. They represent a targeted effort to support financially strained provinces during a period of economic and demographic transition, particularly in the context of aging populations and public pension obligations.

> **Note**: The regulations are specific to the period 2009–2020 and are not intended to create ongoing or future obligations beyond that timeframe. They reflect a one-time policy initiative to address fiscal imbalances during a defined period.
