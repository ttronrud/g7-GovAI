**Detailed Summary of the Electrolux Remission Order (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, known as the *Electrolux Remission Order*, was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under subsection 23(2)a of the *Financial Administration Act*. The purpose of the Order is to **remit (i.e., refund) certain anti-dumping duties** that were previously collected on specific appliances imported by Electrolux Canada Corp. during a defined period.

The remission applies only to a specific portion of the duties — the amount that exceeds the legally determined "margin of dumping" as re-calculated by the Commissioner of Customs and Revenue in 2003. This adjustment reflects a reassessment of dumping margins, which may have been overly punitive or based on outdated data.

   - Excludes dryers with:  
     - Front-mounted controls  
     - Removable tops  
     - Chassis designed to be stacked directly on top of washers  
   - Must be **imported by Electrolux** (as defined below).

2. **Eligible Refrigerators**  
   - Top-mounted electric refrigerators only.  
   - Size must be strictly between:  
     - Greater than 14.5 cubic feet (410.59 litres)  
     - Less than 18.5 cubic feet (524 litres)  
   - Must be **imported by Electrolux**.

3. **Imported by Electrolux**  
   - Goods must have been imported by **Electrolux Canada Corp.** (formerly WCI Canada Inc.).  
   - Origin or export must be from or to the **United States**.  
   - Must bear a trademark owned by:  
     - Electrolux Home Products, Inc.

### **Scope of Remission**

- **Product Types**:  
  - Eligible refrigerators (top-mounted, within size range)  
  - Eligible dryers (excluding those with front controls, removable tops, or stackable chassis)

- **Time Period**:  
  - Applies to importations made between **April 3, 2000**, and **October 31, 2001**.

- **Nature of Remission**:  
  - The remitted amount is **the excess** of the anti-dumping duties paid over the **revised margin of dumping**.  
  - The revised margin is based on the methodology used in the **re-determinations made by the Commissioner of Customs and Revenue on December 5, 2003**, under paragraph 59(1)(e) of the *Special Import Measures Act*.

> In essence, if the duties originally collected were higher than what the government later determined was the legitimate "dumping margin" (i.e., the difference between the export price and the domestic price), the difference is refunded.

### **Conditions for Claiming Remission**

To qualify for remission, a claimant must meet **two conditions**:

1. **Timeliness Requirement**:  
   - The claim must be submitted to the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** **within two years** of the date this Order is made.  
   - Since the Order was issued in 1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 24), the deadline for claims would have been **by 1993** (assuming the Order came into force in 1991).  
   - *Note: This creates a historical limitation — claims must have been filed well before 1993, which may explain why this Order is largely a retrospective correction.*

2. **Documentation Requirement**:  
   - The claim must be accompanied by **all necessary documentation** to verify:  
     - The **eligibility** of the product (i.e., it meets the definition of eligible dryer or refrigerator)  
     - The **specific amount of anti-dumping duties** that were originally paid  
     - The **product's origin, size, and trademark ownership** as required under the definition of "imported by Electrolux"

---

### **Legal Basis**

- The Order is authorized under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to make remissions of duties when it is considered **unjust** to collect them.  
- The Minister of Finance recommended the Order, indicating that the original anti-dumping duties were deemed excessive or unjust in light of updated assessments.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary goal of this remission is to:

- Correct a **potential over-collection** of anti-dumping duties based on outdated or inflated dumping margins.  
- Provide **fairness and economic relief** to Canadian importers (specifically Electrolux Canada Corp.) who paid duties that were later found to exceed what was legally justified.  
- Reflect updated market and cost analyses from 2003, which may have shown that the goods were not dumped at a significant margin as previously believed.

---

### **Implications**

- This is a **retrospective adjustment**, meaning it applies to past importations and does not affect future imports.  
- It serves as a **corrective measure** in the broader framework of anti-dumping policy, where margins are periodically reviewed and adjusted.  
- It reinforces the principle that anti-dumping duties should be based on **current, accurate, and transparent assessments** rather than initial, potentially flawed determinations.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Electrolux Remission Order* is a targeted, legally grounded correction to anti-dumping duties imposed on certain refrigerators and dryers imported from the U.S. by Electrolux Canada Corp. between 2000 and 2001. It refunds the excess duties paid beyond the margin of dumping as re-determined in 2003, under strict eligibility and procedural conditions. The Order ensures that Canadian importers are not unfairly burdened by outdated or inflated duties and reflects a commitment to fairness and accuracy in trade policy enforcement.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Given the issuance date (1991) and the 2003 re-determination, this Order likely serves as a long-term policy correction and may have limited practical impact on new imports. Its main significance lies in historical fairness and administrative accuracy.
