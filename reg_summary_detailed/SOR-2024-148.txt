**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act Fees Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

The *Canadian Navigable Waters Act Fees Regulations* are a set of administrative rules made under **subsection 28(1)a** of the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* (CNA), which grants the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) the authority to establish fees for certain activities related to the use and development of navigable waters in Canada.

These regulations were introduced through **Statutory Instrument S.C. 2019, c. 28, sections 61(1) to (3)** and are aligned with the broader legislative framework found in:
- *Regulation S.R.C., c. N-22* (the Canadian Navigable Waters Act),
- *S.C. 2012, c. 31, s. 316* (which provides for fee structures),
- And *S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 46*, which authorizes the fee provisions.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish a transparent, standardized fee structure** for applicants seeking approval to undertake various types of works or exemptions in navigable waters, ensuring that the costs of environmental assessment, regulatory review, and administrative oversight are fairly and consistently recovered.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Application Fee Structure**
An owner or applicant who submits a formal application under:
- **Subsection 5(1)** of the CNA (for construction, placement, alteration, or rebuilding of a work), or  
- **Paragraph 10(1)(a)** of the CNA (for certain types of works involving navigable waters)

**must pay a fee** to the Minister of Transport. The fee is determined based on two key factors:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|----------|------------------|
| **Column 1 – Application Period** | The time period during which the application is submitted (e.g., early, mid, late stage). This may reflect a tiered fee structure to encourage timely submissions or discourage delays. |
| **Column 2–4 – Category of Work** | The specific type of work being proposed. The fee varies depending on the nature and complexity of the project. |

> The table in the regulation lists 25 different categories of works, each with its own fee category. Examples include:
> - Jetty
> - Pier
> - Wharf
> - Artificial reef
> - Fishway
> - Berm
> - Groyne
> - Riprap
> - Counting fence
> - Aquatic sports jump
> - Water ski course
> - Scaffolding
> - Debris boom
> - Ice boom
> - Log boom
> - Protective barrier
> - Safety boom
> - Floating breakwater
> - Floating building
> - Heliport or landing pad
> - Observation tower
> - Oil production platform
> - Hydroelectric station
> - Tidal turbine
> - Wind turbine
> - Deep water terminal
> - Ferry terminal
> - Underwater corridor
> - Water diversion
> - Fish weir
> - Submerged weir

> **Note:** While the full fee table is referenced in the regulation, the actual dollar amounts are not included in the provided text. However, the structure indicates that fees are categorized by work type and application period.

#### **2. Multiple Works – Cumulative Fees**
If an application involves **more than one type of work**, the applicant must pay the **sum of the fees** corresponding to each individual work. For example, if an application includes both a pier and a floating breakwater, the total fee will be the sum of the fees for each.

This ensures that the cost reflects the total regulatory burden associated with multiple projects.

#### **3. Exemption Application Fee**
A separate fee applies when an applicant submits a request for an **exemption** under **subsection 24(1)** of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act.

- **Fee: $66,000**  
- This must be paid **at the time of submission** of the exemption application.

> This provision reflects the significant regulatory scrutiny often involved in exemptions—especially those that may alter or interfere with navigable waters, fish habitats, or environmental protections.

---

### **Application and Enforcement**

- The fees are **paid directly to the Minister of Transport**.
- The fee is **not a permit fee**, but rather a **regulatory cost recovery mechanism** designed to fund the administrative and environmental review processes.
- Fees are intended to:
  - Cover the cost of processing applications,
  - Support environmental assessments,
  - Ensure equitable funding across projects of different scales and complexities.

---

### **Amendments and Effective Date**

- These regulations are **subject to amendment** (as noted in the "[Amendments]" section).
- They **come into force on the day they are published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.

This means that the fees are immediately enforceable upon official publication, providing legal certainty for applicants and regulators alike.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

The fee structure serves several key policy objectives:

1. **Cost Recovery**: Ensures that the government recovers administrative and environmental review costs from those who benefit from development in navigable waters.
2. **Transparency**: Provides clear, publicly accessible fee categories based on work type and timing.
3. **Equity**: Prevents undue burden on small operators while ensuring larger, more complex projects contribute proportionally.
4. **Environmental Protection**: Supports the regulatory oversight necessary to protect aquatic ecosystems, fish migration, and navigation safety—especially for works like fishways, weirs, and artificial reefs.
5. **Predictability**: Offers applicants a clear understanding of financial obligations before initiating a project.

### **Implications for Applicants**

Applicants must:
- Identify the **exact type of work** proposed.
- Determine the **application submission period** (which may affect the fee).
- Calculate the **total fee** (including any additional fees for multiple works or exemptions).
- Pay the full amount **before** the application is processed.

Failure to pay the required fee may result in:
- Application rejection,
- Delays in processing,
- Loss of eligibility for approval.

### **Conclusion**

The *Canadian Navigable Waters Act Fees Regulations* establish a **comprehensive, tiered fee system** for activities that impact navigable waters in Canada. By linking fees to the **type of work** and **timing of application**, the regulations promote transparency, accountability, and equitable cost distribution. The inclusion of a **separate $66,000 exemption fee** underscores the importance of environmental and navigational safeguards when altering or exempting from regulatory requirements.

These regulations are a critical component of the federal government’s approach to balancing **economic development** with **environmental protection** in Canada’s waterways.
