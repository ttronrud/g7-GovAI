## **Overview**

This regulation establishes specific requirements for **banks and authorized foreign banks** operating in Canadian provinces regarding the **designation and public disclosure of offices** for the **service of enforcement notices** under the *Bank Act*.

The regulation applies to both **domestic banks** and **authorized foreign banks** conducting business in a province. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the effective service of enforcement notices—such as those issued under support orders or support provisions—by ensuring that the relevant financial institution has a clearly identified and publicly accessible office in each province.

Once a bank or authorized foreign bank designates an office, it must publicly disclose the **name and address** of that office in the following two ways:

1. **In the Canada Gazette, Part I**  
   - A formal, official publication in the federal government’s official journal.

2. **In Newspapers in General Circulation in the Province**  
   - Published **at least once per week for four consecutive weeks** in one or more newspapers widely circulated in the province.

> 📌 *This ensures that the public, including individuals subject to enforcement actions, can locate the designated office.*

#### **Requirement for Changes**
If a bank or foreign bank:
- Changes the designated office in a province, or  
- Changes the name or address of a designated office,

It must **publish a description of the change** in the **same manner** as required for initial designation.

#### **Deadline for Change Disclosure**
