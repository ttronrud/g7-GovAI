**Detailed Summary of the Investors’ Indemnity Regulations**

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulations are formally titled the **Investors’ Indemnity Regulations** and may be cited as such. These rules establish the procedures, eligibility criteria, and administrative framework for claims against the **Investors’ Indemnity Account**, a fund designed to protect investors who suffer financial losses due to failures in the issuance, redemption, or delivery of securities.

---

### **2. Scope of Eligible Claims**
The regulations define specific types of claims that may be submitted to the Minister of Finance for payment from the Investors’ Indemnity Account. These include losses arising in the following situations:

#### **(a) Failure to Receive a Security or Repayment After Payment**
- A person (referred to as a "subscriber") who has paid all or part of the purchase price of a security but has **not received the security** or **repayment** of the amount paid.

#### **(b) Claims by Persons Who Paid on Account to the Receiver General or Authorized Agent**
- A person who made a payment on account of a security to:
  - The **Receiver General**, or
  - A person **duly authorized** to accept subscriptions on behalf of Her Majesty (i.e., the Crown),
- And who has **not received** the security or a **satisfactory accounting or repayment** of the amount paid.

#### **(c) Claims for Securities Forwarded to the Bank of Canada or Public Officer for Redemption**
- A person whose securities were **forwarded by mail** to the **Bank of Canada** or a department or public officer for redemption, but who has **not received payment** from the person entitled to receive it.

#### **(d) Claims by Redemption Agents (excluding Bank of Canada)**
- A **redemption agent** (other than the Bank of Canada) who incurs a loss in redeeming:
  - **Canada Savings Bonds**, or
  - **War Saving Stamps**,
- Where the loss **does not result from the fault or negligence** of the agent or any person under their supervision or control.

#### **(e) Failure to Receive Issued Securities in Exchange**
- A loss arising from a failure to receive:
  - **Principal, accrued interest, or premium** in respect of a security issued in exchange for another security.

> *Note: The regulation explicitly excludes claims arising from fault or negligence of the agent or employee, ensuring the indemnity is not used to compensate for mismanagement or misconduct.*

---

### **3. Submission of Claims**
- All claims must be submitted to the **Minister of Finance**.
- Each claim must be accompanied by a **detailed statement of relevant facts**, including:
  - Nature of the transaction,
  - Amount paid,
  - Date of payment,
  - Identity of the person to whom payment was made,
  - Evidence of failure to receive the security or repayment.

---

### **4. Investigation Requirement**
- **No payment** will be made until the claim has been **investigated** by:
  - An officer of the **Department of Finance**, or
  - Another person designated by the Minister of Finance.
- The investigation must include a **report** detailing findings and supporting evidence.

---

### **5. Payment Decision and Limitations**
- After reviewing:
  - The claim statement,
  - The facts presented,
  - The investigation report,
- The Minister of Finance may decide to make a payment.
- The **amount of payment** is determined by the Minister and must be paid to:
  - The claimant,
  - The claimant’s **legal representatives**, or
  - Any other person designated by the Minister.
- **Maximum payment limit**:
  - **No payment exceeding $5,000** may be made.
  - Any payment **above $5,000** requires **prior approval from the Treasury Board**.

> *This cap ensures fiscal responsibility and prevents unlimited liability from the indemnity fund.*

---

### **6. Special Requirement for Certain Claims**
For claims involving:
- A subscriber who paid money to a person authorized to receive subscriptions, or
- A subscriber whose employer retained funds to purchase a security on their behalf,

**No payment** will be made from the Investors’ Indemnity Account **unless**:
- The subscriber or their legal representative **executes an assignment** in favour of **Her Majesty** (the Crown) of:
  - All claims related to the amount paid or retained,
  - And any rights or interests in the security involved.

> *This provision ensures that the Crown (as the ultimate owner of the securities) is properly protected and that the indemnity fund is not used to compensate individuals who retain rights to the security or funds. It serves as a condition to prevent potential conflicts of interest or claims against the government.*

---

### **7. Annual Reporting Requirement**
- The Department of Finance must submit an **annual statement** to the **Treasury Board** within **60 days after the end of each fiscal year**.
- The statement must include:
  - A summary of **all payments** made from the Investors’ Indemnity Account,
  - A record of **recoveries credited** to the Account (e.g., from insurance, reissuance, or other sources).

> *This ensures transparency, accountability, and oversight of the fund’s operations and financial health.*
