### **Overview**
The *Firearms Records Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under the *Firearms Act* (the "Act") to define what records must be maintained, how long they must be retained, who is responsible for maintaining them, and under what circumstances they may be amended or destroyed. These regulations were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, and came into force on **December 1, 1998**.

The regulations were laid before both Houses of Parliament on **November 27, 1996**, which satisfies the statutory requirement under section 118 of the Firearms Act that proposed regulations be publicly disclosed at least 30 sitting days before implementation.

- **Paragraph 83(1)(f)** – Requires the Registrar to maintain certain records related to firearm licences, authorizations, and applications.
- **Paragraph 87(1)(d)** – Requires chief firearms officers (CFOs) to maintain records related to shooting clubs, recognizance conditions, and certifications.
- **Section 84** – Governs the retention period of records in the Canadian Firearms Registry.
- **Paragraphs 87(1)(c)** and **117(m), (s), (w)** – Address retention of prohibition orders and other sensitive records.

### **4. Record Retention Periods**

#### **General Rule (Section 84 and Paragraph 87(1)(d))**
- **All records** kept in the Canadian Firearms Registry or by a chief firearms officer shall **not be destroyed** until **10 years after the date of the last administrative action** taken regarding the record (e.g., a licence issued, revoked, or a condition changed).

> This ensures that records remain accessible for investigations, audits, or legal proceedings for a minimum of a decade.

#### **Special Retention Rules (Despite Section 5 – Personal Information Retention)**

| Record Type | Retention Period | Exception |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Record confirming an individual has met section 7 requirements** (including date and place of course/test) | **Until the death of the individual** | Not subject to 10-year rule. |
| **Certifications issued under paragraph 7(4)(a)** | **Until the death of the individual** | Not subject to 10-year rule. |
| **Prohibition orders under section 147.1 of the National Defence Act** | **Until the death of the individual** | Not subject to 10-year rule. **Exception**: If the individual meets the requirements of subsection 7(3) of the Act (e.g., completes training and is cleared), the record may be destroyed. |

> These provisions ensure that critical personal and legal information related to firearm eligibility and prohibitions is preserved indefinitely, unless formally released or cleared.

> **Note**: Section 5 of the Act normally governs the destruction of personal records after a set period. This regulation **overrides** that rule for specific sensitive records involving eligibility, training, and prohibitions.

### **5. Record Amendments**

#### **Canadian Firearms Registry (Registrar's Records)**
- Records in the CFR may be **amended only by the Registrar**.

### **6. Request to Amend Personal Records**

An individual may request to correct personal information in a record if it is inaccurate or outdated. The process is as follows:

| Record Type | Where to Submit Application |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Record in the Canadian Firearms Registry** | To the **Registrar** |
| **Record under section 87 of the Act (provincial records)** | To the **chief firearms officer** in the province where the record was originally created |

> This provision gives individuals access to their own records and the right to have factual errors corrected, promoting data accuracy and privacy.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force on December 1, 1998**.

---

## **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve several key purposes:

1. **Transparency and Accountability**: Establishes clear, standardized record-keeping practices across federal and provincial levels.
2. **Public Safety**: Ensures that records of prohibited weapons, restrictions, and training are preserved to prevent misuse and illegal firearm possession.
3. **Legal Compliance**: Provides a legal framework for enforcement, investigations, and judicial review.
4. **Individual Rights**: Includes mechanisms for individuals to request corrections to their personal records, balancing public interest with privacy.
5. **Inter-agency Coordination**: Requires communication between the Registrar and chief firearms officers to maintain consistency and prevent discrepancies.

---

## **Key Implications**

- **Long-term retention** of certain records (especially those related to training, prohibitions, and eligibility) means that individuals may have their records accessible for decades, even after they are no longer active in the firearms system.
- **Provincial autonomy** is respected through the CFO’s role in maintaining local records, while the federal Registrar maintains the central registry.
- **Privacy protections** are balanced with public safety through the specific exceptions to destruction (e.g., after death or upon meeting certain requirements).
- The regulations support **inter-agency cooperation** between federal and provincial authorities in enforcing firearm laws.

## **Conclusion**

The *Firearms Records Regulations* are a foundational piece of administrative law within Canada’s firearms framework. They establish a comprehensive, legally binding system for collecting, storing, and managing records related to firearm licensing, training, prohibitions, and possession. By setting clear retention periods, defining record content, and empowering individuals to correct inaccuracies, the regulations enhance both public safety and individual rights within the legal and regulatory framework of the *Firearms Act*.

These rules remain relevant today, as they continue to underpin the integrity of Canada’s firearms licensing and enforcement systems.
