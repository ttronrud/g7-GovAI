### **Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation establishes a framework for the payment of **ex-gratia (voluntary, non-monetary) compensation of $20,000** to individuals or entities who are entitled to receive such payments on behalf of a deceased person who:
- Was a **Chinese Head Tax payer** (i.e., a person who paid the Chinese Head Tax in the early 20th century), or  
- Was in a **conjugal relationship** (such as marriage or common-law) with a Chinese Head Tax payer who died.

The purpose is to provide financial redress to eligible beneficiaries who were not able to claim compensation under the original ex-gratia payment orders due to lack of awareness, procedural barriers, or other historical and systemic challenges.

### **Key Definitions and Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Who is the "Minister"?**
- The term *Minister* refers to the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** of Canada.

#### 2. **Eligibility Criteria for Payment**
A person or entity is eligible for a $20,000 ex-gratia payment if:
- The deceased person **met the criteria** under either of the following:
  - **Section 2 of the Order Respecting Ex-Gratia Payments to Chinese Head Tax Payers** (SI/2006-109):  
    This applies to individuals who were **Chinese Head Tax payers** and died after the tax was introduced (1858–1923). Eligibility is based on historical criteria such as being a Chinese individual who paid the head tax to immigrate to Canada.
  
  - **Section 2 of the Order Respecting Ex-Gratia Payments to Persons Who Were in Conjugal Relationships with Now Deceased Chinese Head Tax Payers or to Designated Beneficiaries** (SI/2006-137):  
    This applies to individuals who were **in a conjugal relationship** (e.g., married or in a common-law relationship) with a deceased Chinese Head Tax payer. It also includes designated beneficiaries of such relationships.

> **Note:** The payment is available **only to those who did not previously apply** for compensation under the original orders.

#### 3. **Application Requirements**
- An application for the ex-gratia payment must have been submitted to the Minister **on or before March 31, 2008**, in the form approved by the Minister and supported by **any evidence** the Minister considers necessary (e.g., proof of relationship, death certificate, immigration records, etc.).

- **Exception for Late Applications (March 31, 2008 to March 31, 2009):**  
  If an application was submitted **after March 31, 2008 but on or before March 31, 2009**, it may still be accepted **if the Minister is satisfied** that the applicant had **no control over the delay** — for example, due to illness, lack of documentation, or other circumstances beyond their control.

> This provision recognizes that historical barriers and lack of awareness may have prevented timely applications.

#### 4. **Nature of the Payment**
- Each payment is a **one-time lump sum of $20,000**.
- The payment is **not a legal settlement** or admission of liability.
- It is **not a refund** or compensation for damages, but rather a **voluntary, charitable gesture** by the Government of Canada.

#### 5. **No Admission of Liability**
- The payment **shall not be construed as an admission of liability** on the part of the Crown.  
- This is important legally — it means the government is not acknowledging wrongdoing or liability in a legal sense, but rather offering a gesture of goodwill and historical recognition.

---

### **Key Historical Context**
- The **Chinese Head Tax** was imposed in 1858 and continued until 1923, when it was replaced by a per capita fee. It was a discriminatory policy that targeted Chinese immigrants and their families.
- The original ex-gratia payment programs (established in the 2000s) aimed to provide compensation to eligible survivors and relatives.
- This regulation specifically targets **those who missed the original application windows**, either due to lack of awareness, poor record-keeping, or systemic barriers.

---

### **Significance and Impact**
- Provides **historical justice** to individuals and families affected by discriminatory immigration policies.
- Recognizes the **human cost** of past government policies.
- Offers a **practical and accessible pathway** for eligible individuals to receive financial support, even if they were unable to apply earlier.
- Reinforces Canada’s commitment to **reconciliation and redress** for Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups affected by systemic discrimination.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**
- The payment is **not available to all descendants** or relatives — only those who meet the specific criteria defined in the original legislation.
- The **application must be submitted within a specific time frame** (March 31, 2008, or extended to March 31, 2009).
- The **payment is not retroactive** beyond the specified dates.
- No payment is made to applicants who do not meet the eligibility criteria or who fail to provide sufficient documentation.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a **targeted, compassionate, and historically grounded** measure designed to address the legacy of the Chinese Head Tax. It enables eligible beneficiaries — particularly those who were not able to apply in earlier periods — to receive a one-time, non-liability-based payment of $20,000. It reflects Canada’s ongoing efforts to acknowledge past injustices and provide meaningful redress to affected individuals and communities.

It is a significant step in the broader framework of **truth and reconciliation**, particularly in relation to the treatment of Chinese immigrants in Canada’s early immigration history.
