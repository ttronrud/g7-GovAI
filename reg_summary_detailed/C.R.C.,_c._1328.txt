**Detailed Summary of the Rideau Canal Lease Regulations**

**Regulation Title:**  
*The Rideau Canal Lease Regulations*

**Citation:**  
This Regulation may be cited as *The Rideau Canal Lease Regulations*.

---

**Purpose and Scope:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to authorize the leasing of specific lands situated along the Rideau Canal in the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, Ontario, to two corporate entities. The lease is intended to facilitate development or use of the land for commercial or related purposes, while preserving the historical and environmental significance of the Rideau Canal area.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Authority of the Minister:**  
   The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND) is empowered to issue a lease under this regulation. This authority is exercised despite a statutory restriction found in subsection 4(2) of the *Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canal Land Regulations* (commonly referred to as the I.A. and N.D. Canal Land Regulations). This means that even though the general rules of those regulations typically restrict leasing of canal lands, this specific regulation overrides that restriction in order to enable the proposed lease.

2. **Lessees:**  
   The lease is granted to two corporate entities:
   - **Galeries Canada Holdings Limited**
   - **Olympia & York Developments Limited**  
   Both are bodies corporate duly incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario. This indicates that the lessees are legally recognized and operating within Ontario’s corporate framework.

3. **Land Description:**  
   The lands being leased are located on the Rideau Canal and are situated within the **Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton**, Ontario.  
   The total area of the leased land is approximately **61,600 square feet**.  
   The exact boundaries of the land are clearly defined and marked on **Plan No. 42482**, dated **November 8, 1974**. This plan is officially on file with the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND), ensuring that the parcel is formally documented and accessible for verification.

4. **Term of Lease:**  
   The lease is granted for a fixed term of **42 years**. This long-term duration suggests a significant investment or development commitment from the lessees, and implies that the land will be used for a sustained period, likely for commercial, retail, or mixed-use development.

5. **Legal Basis and Exception:**  
   The regulation explicitly states that it operates *notwithstanding* subsection 4(2) of the I.A. and N.D. Canal Land Regulations. This is a critical legal provision because it allows the Minister to proceed with the lease despite the general rule that such lands are not typically subject to private lease agreements. This exception underscores the importance of the proposed development and the Minister’s discretion in exceptional circumstances—possibly due to economic, historical, or strategic reasons.

**Implications and Context:**

- **Historical Significance:** The Rideau Canal is a historic waterway, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (as part of the Rideau Canal System), and is a key cultural and recreational asset in Ottawa. Any development on its lands must balance public interest with private development needs.

- **Public Interest and Oversight:** Given the heritage value of the canal, the leasing of land by a government department to private entities requires careful oversight. The fact that the lease is authorized by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development suggests that the decision may be tied to broader Indigenous land management, heritage preservation, or regional development strategies.

- **Development Potential:** The land, at approximately 61,600 square feet, is likely intended for commercial or retail use—possibly related to the nearby Galeries Canada (a retail and shopping complex) and Olympia & York (a known developer in Ottawa). The lease may support the expansion or modernization of commercial infrastructure in the area.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Rideau Canal Lease Regulations* authorize the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to lease approximately 61,600 square feet of land along the Rideau Canal for a 42-year term to Galeries Canada Holdings Limited and Olympia & York Developments Limited. This action overrides a general prohibition on leasing such lands under the I.A. and N.D. Canal Land Regulations, indicating a deliberate policy decision to promote development in a historically significant area. The lease is based on a formal land plan (Plan No. 42482), ensuring legal clarity and accountability. The regulation reflects a balance between enabling private investment and preserving the cultural and environmental integrity of the Rideau Canal.
