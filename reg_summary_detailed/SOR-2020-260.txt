## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Administrative Monetary Penalties (Canada Labour Code) Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The authority stems from the **Canada Labour Code (R.S., c. L-2)** and is further referenced in **S.C. 2017, c. 20, s. 377**.
- The regulations implement a system of **administrative monetary penalties (AMPs)** to enforce compliance with the Canada Labour Code.

---

## 🎯 **Core Purpose**
To establish a clear, transparent, and proportionate system for:
- Identifying violations of the Canada Labour Code;
- Classifying them into types (A–E);
- Assigning appropriate financial penalties based on the nature and severity of the violation;
- Taking into account a person’s or department’s history of non-compliance;
- Ensuring fair and accessible enforcement mechanisms, including early payment options and service procedures.

## 🔍 **What Constitutes a Violation?**

The following are designated as violations that can be proceeded with under **Part IV of the Canada Labour Code**:

| Type of Violation | Specific Provisions |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 1. Contravention of any provision in **Part II** of the Act (e.g., working conditions, wages, hours) or any regulation made under it — if specified in **column 1 of Part 1 or 2 of Schedule 1**. |
| 2. Contravention of any provision in **Part III** of the Act (e.g., safety, health, and workplace standards) or any regulation made under it — if specified in **column 1 of Part 1 or 2 of Schedule 2**. |
| 3. Contravention of a **direction issued under Part II** — if specified in **column 1 of Part 3 of Schedule 1**. |
| 4. Contravention of an **order made under Part II** — if specified in **column 1 of Part 4 of Schedule 1**. |
| 5. Contravention of an **order made under Part III** — if specified in **column 1 of Part 3 of Schedule 2**. |
| 6. **Failure to comply with conditions of a permit issued under Section 176** — if specified in **column 1 of Part 4 of Schedule 2**. |

> ⚠️ *Note:* These violations are not automatically enforceable; they must be formally identified in a **Notice of Violation** issued by the Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD).

## 🏷️ **Classification of Violations: Types A to E**

Each violation is classified as **Type A, B, C, D, or E**, based on the **gravity** of the violation, as defined in **column 2 of the relevant schedule**.

- **Classification Logic**:
  - The **gravity increases alphabetically** (e.g., "A" is less serious than "E").
  - This classification determines both the **baseline penalty amount** and the **penalty multiplier** for repeat offenders.

> Example: A violation related to unsafe working conditions may be classified as Type E (most serious), while a minor wage calculation error may be Type A.

---

## 💰 **Penalty Calculation: Baseline + History of Non-Compliance**

The total penalty is calculated as:

> **Total Penalty = Baseline Penalty + History of Non-Compliance Amount**

### 1. **Baseline Penalty Amount**
- Determined by **column 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 3**.
- Based on two factors:
  - **Category of the violator** (e.g., individual, small business, large business, government department)
  - **Type of violation** (e.g., Type A, B, C, D, or E)

> Example: A small business violating a wage provision (Type B) may face a baseline penalty of $1,000.

### 2. **History of Non-Compliance Amount**
- Applies **only if** the violator has a history of non-compliance in the **five years before** the notice of violation is issued.
- The amount is **twice the baseline penalty**.

> 📌 *History of non-compliance triggers a penalty doubling.*

## 📅 **What Constitutes a "History of Non-Compliance"?**

A person or department is considered to have a history of non-compliance if **any of the following apply** within the five years prior to the issuance of the notice:

| Condition | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| 1. Was issued a **notice of violation** for a violation of the **same type** or **greater gravity** and was ultimately found to have committed the violation — under **section 289 or 290** of the Act. | The violation must relate to the **same Part** of the Code (e.g., Part II or III). |
| 2. Was **found guilty of an offence** under the Act. | Includes criminal findings related to labour law breaches. |
| 3. Was subject to an **order under section 153** of the Act. | Such orders may include safety or health-related directives. |

> 🔍 **Key Limitation**:  
> - The violation must relate to the **same Part** of the Act (e.g., Part II or III).  
> - Violations from different parts (e.g., Part II vs. Part III) do not count toward this history.

> ⚖️ *Example*: A business that previously violated wage rules (Part II) is not considered to have a history of non-compliance for a safety violation (Part III), even if both occurred recently.

- A **person or department** named in a notice of violation for a **Type A, B, or C violation** may:

| Method | Deemed Date |
|-------|-------------|

This section clarifies how to determine an employee’s **regular rate of wages** when calculating penalties or benefits (e.g., vacation pay, overtime).

### General Rule:
> Regular rate = Total wages earned / Total hours worked (excluding overtime)

### Specific Rules:

| Scenario | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
