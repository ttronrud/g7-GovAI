### **Detailed Summary of the Ships’ Stores Regulations (Canada, 1995)**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

The **Ships’ Stores Regulations** were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under two key provisions of Canadian law:

- **Subsection 95(1)** of the *Customs Tariff*  
- **Subsection 59(3.2)** of the *Excise Tax Act*

These regulations were enacted to **define and regulate the types of goods that may be carried on board ships and international aircraft** as "ships’ stores" for the purposes of customs and excise compliance. The primary objective is to **facilitate legitimate operational needs** of maritime and aeronautical conveyances while **preventing the unauthorized importation or smuggling of alcohol, tobacco, and other controlled goods**.

The regulations came into force on the date that **Section 55 of the *Act to amend the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff* (Chapter 41 of the Statutes of Canada, 1995)** came into effect — **January 1, 1996**.
