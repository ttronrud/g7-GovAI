**Detailed Summary of the Advertising Material Remission Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Advertising Material Remission Order* and may be cited as such. It is a statutory instrument under Canadian excise tax law, designed to provide tax relief (remission) for specific types of imported advertising materials.

---

**2. Definition of "Advertising Material"**  
The term *advertising material* is specifically defined as:  
- Catalogues  
- Price lists  
- Trade notices  

These are documents used to promote goods or services for sale or rental, and are subject to the remission provisions outlined in the Order.

---

**3. Scope of Tax Remission**  
Under this Order, **a full remission (exemption)** is granted for all taxes payable or previously paid under:  
- **Division III of Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act* (which generally governs excise taxes on certain goods and services), and  
- **Any other part of the Excise Tax Act** that applies to advertising material.  

This remission applies **only to advertising material imported into Canada on or after January 1, 1991**.

---

**4. Eligible Goods and Services**  
The remission applies to advertising material that promotes the following:  
- Goods offered for sale or rental  
- Transport services  
- Commercial insurance services  

This means that if an importer brings into Canada a catalogue, price list, or trade notice that promotes any of these three categories, the tax on that material is waived.

---

**5. Conditions for Remission**  
For the remission to apply, the advertising material must meet **all of the following conditions**:

#### a) Document Structure Requirements  
The importation must satisfy **one of the following**:
- **One document only** (i.e., a single catalogue or price list), or  
- **More than one document**, but **no more than one copy of any single document** (e.g., multiple price lists from different suppliers, but not multiple copies of the same one), or  
- **Irrespective of the number of documents or copies**, the **total gross weight** of the shipment does **not exceed 1 kilogram (2.205 pounds)**.

> This ensures that the remission is not extended to large volumes or bulk shipments of advertising material, which could otherwise lead to unintended tax exemptions for significant quantities.

#### b) Origin and Source Disclosure Requirement  
The advertising material must:  
- **Clearly indicate the name of the foreign supplier** of the goods or services being advertised, and  
- **Not indicate any Canadian source of supply** for those goods or services.

> This requirement ensures that the advertising material is genuinely promoting foreign-origin products or services and not misleadingly suggesting a Canadian origin. It prevents misuse of the remission to promote Canadian goods or services under false pretenses.

**6. Key Implications and Purpose**  
- **Objective**: To reduce the tax burden on legitimate foreign advertising materials used to promote internationally sourced goods and services, particularly in sectors like transport and insurance.  
- **Fairness**: Ensures that foreign suppliers are not unfairly burdened by excise taxes when they use standard promotional materials to market their services in Canada.  
- **Prevention of Abuse**: The strict conditions (e.g., weight limits, source disclosure) prevent misuse of the remission, such as using large volumes of advertising to circumvent taxes or misrepresenting the origin of goods/services.  
- **Clarity and Enforcement**: The clear definitions and conditions provide a transparent framework for importers, customs officials, and tax authorities to apply and enforce the remission appropriately.

---

**7. Limitations and Exclusions**  
- The remission **does not apply** to advertising material that:  
  - Exceeds 1 kg in gross weight (even if only one document),  
  - Includes multiple copies of the same document,  
  - Indicates a Canadian source of supply (e.g., a price list stating "produced in Toronto"), or  
  - Promotes goods or services outside the three specified categories (goods for sale/rental, transport, or commercial insurance).  
- The remission is **not available retroactively**—only for imports on or after January 1, 1991.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Advertising Material Remission Order* provides a targeted, conditional exemption from excise taxes on imported advertising materials related to specific goods and services. It promotes fair trade practices by ensuring that foreign suppliers are not taxed on standard promotional materials that clearly identify their foreign origin and do not exceed defined weight and duplication limits. The regulation balances tax policy with practical trade needs while including safeguards to prevent fraud or abuse.  

This Order is a key component of Canada’s excise tax framework, supporting international commerce while maintaining fiscal integrity.
