### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
The regulation is issued under **Section 8 of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2017, c. 33, s. 219)**. This section empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to make orders to repeal or amend provisions related to the implementation of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), particularly those that relate to the administrative structure or responsibilities of government officials in enforcing or overseeing the agreement.

**2. Repeal of Prior Order in Council**  
The regulation **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2023-776**, issued on **July 26, 2023**.  
- This prior order had likely established or maintained certain administrative or procedural rules related to the implementation of the CFTA, possibly including the designation of a minister or the establishment of a committee or process for handling trade-related matters.  
- By repealing this order, the government is effectively removing its previous provisions, signaling a change in administrative approach or policy direction regarding CFTA implementation.

**3. Designation of the Minister of Transport**  
The regulation **designates the Minister of Transport as the Minister for the purposes of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act**.  
- This means that, going forward, the **Minister of Transport** will be the official responsible for overseeing and fulfilling the duties related to the implementation of the CFTA as defined under the Act.  
- The designation is made **on the basis that the Minister of Transport is a member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal requirement under the Act for such ministerial appointments in trade-related roles.

**4. Purpose and Implications**  
- The designation of the Minister of Transport reflects a strategic decision to assign trade implementation responsibilities to a ministry with expertise in transportation policy, infrastructure, and cross-border logistics—key components of international trade.  
- It may also streamline coordination between federal departments, as the transportation sector plays a critical role in trade flows (e.g., border crossings, customs, freight, and supply chains).  
- The repeal of Order P.C. 2023-776 suggests that the previous administrative structure was either outdated, inconsistent, or no longer necessary, and that a new, more efficient structure is now in place.

**5. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
- This regulation is a formal, legally binding instrument issued under the authority of the Crown in Council.  
- It ensures clarity and accountability in the implementation of the CFTA by clearly assigning responsibility to a specific minister.  
- The designation under Section 8 of the Act is not merely symbolic—it confers specific authority and responsibility for the coordination, monitoring, and reporting related to CFTA implementation.

**6. Effective Date and Scope**  
While not explicitly stated in your excerpt, such orders typically take effect immediately upon publication in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (or in the official journal). The scope is limited to the provisions of the CFTA Implementation Act and does not extend to other trade agreements or legislation.

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a **structural and administrative update** to the implementation of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. By repealing an earlier order and designating the **Minister of Transport** as the responsible minister, the government is streamlining oversight, aligning responsibilities with relevant sectoral expertise, and ensuring compliance with the statutory framework under the CFTA Implementation Act. This move underscores a shift toward more targeted and efficient governance of trade implementation, particularly in areas involving transportation and cross-border trade infrastructure.
