**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea) Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulatory instrument is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically **subsection 58(4) and 58(5)** of the Act (S.C. 2002, c. 29). SARA is a federal law in Canada designed to prevent species from becoming extinct and to promote their recovery by identifying, protecting, and managing critical habitat.

- **Section 58(1)** of SARA establishes that the critical habitat of a listed species must be identified and protected to ensure the survival and recovery of that species.
- **Section 58(4)** authorizes the Minister of the Environment to make an Order designating the critical habitat of a listed species.
- **Section 58(5)** provides that any portion of the critical habitat located in a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of the Act must be excluded from the Order. Subsection 58(2)(b) refers to areas that are "within the jurisdiction of a provincial or territorial government" or "within a place that is not under federal jurisdiction," and thus, such areas are not subject to federal regulation under SARA.

**2. Species at Stake: The Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea)**

- The Cerulean Warbler is a migratory bird species classified as **Endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA.
- This classification reflects the species’ declining population, limited range, and significant threats to its survival, including habitat loss and fragmentation.
- The species relies on specific forested habitats—particularly mature, moist deciduous forests with dense understory vegetation—for breeding and foraging.

---

**3. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**

- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Cerulean Warbler was developed and published as part of the *Species at Risk Public Registry*, which is the official, publicly accessible database of species at risk in Canada.
- This strategy includes a detailed **identification of critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery.
- The critical habitat identified in the strategy is **located on federal lands within Gatineau Park**, a protected area in the province of Quebec.

**4. Key Legal and Jurisdictional Consideration**

- **Subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA defines a category of places where federal critical habitat designations are **not applicable** because they fall under the jurisdiction of provincial or territorial authorities.
- However, **the portion of the Cerulean Warbler’s critical habitat located within Gatineau Park is on federal lands**, meaning it is **within the federal jurisdiction** and thus **not subject to exclusion under subsection 58(2)(b)**.
- Therefore, the federal government has the legal authority under **section 58(5)** to designate this portion of the critical habitat in an Order.

> **Important Note**: The Order is not made to exclude any part of the critical habitat; rather, it **specifically designates** the portion located on federal lands within Gatineau Park, **because it falls within federal jurisdiction** and is not subject to exclusion under subsection 58(2)(b).

**5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- The **Critical Habitat of the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea) Order** formally designates the specific areas within Gatineau Park that are essential for the survival and recovery of the Cerulean Warbler.
- This designation:
  - Provides legal protection to these areas from actions that could destroy or significantly degrade the habitat.
  - Ensures that federal agencies must consult with the Minister of the Environment before undertaking projects (e.g., development, infrastructure, logging) that may affect the designated critical habitat.
  - Supports the broader recovery goals outlined in the species’ recovery strategy.
- The Order **does not apply to areas outside federal jurisdiction**—such as parts of Gatineau Park managed by the provincial government—because those areas fall under provincial jurisdiction and are excluded under section 58(2)(b).

---

**6. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette, the official journal of federal laws.
- Once registered, it becomes enforceable under SARA and is binding on all federal departments, agencies, and undertakings.
- Enforcement is carried out through the Minister of the Environment, who may initiate regulatory actions or consultations when potential threats to the designated critical habitat arise.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**

- This Order is a key step in the recovery of the Cerulean Warbler by ensuring that the most vital habitats are legally protected.
- It reflects a commitment by the federal government to fulfill its obligations under SARA to conserve and manage critical habitat for endangered species.
- It also underscores the importance of **cooperative conservation**—the federal government working in tandem with provincial authorities and conservation partners to protect biodiversity across jurisdictional boundaries.

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea) Order* issued on **May 5, 2022**, in Gatineau, Quebec, legally designates and protects a portion of the species’ critical habitat located on **federal lands within Gatineau Park**. This designation is grounded in the species’ endangered status, the recovery strategy, and the legal framework of the *Species at Risk Act*. The Order is valid because the habitat is within federal jurisdiction and thus not subject to exclusion under section 58(2)(b). It serves as a vital tool in safeguarding the Cerulean Warbler’s future and advancing Canada’s biodiversity conservation goals.
