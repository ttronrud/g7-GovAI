**Detailed Summary of the Camp Ipperwash Indian Settlement Remission Order, 2003**

---

### **Overview**

The *Camp Ipperwash Indian Settlement Remission Order, 2003* is a regulatory instrument issued under the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)** by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**. This Order provides a formal remission (i.e., a reduction or cancellation) of certain taxes and related charges for individuals and bands whose income or taxable supplies were tied to the **Camp Ipperwash Indian Settlement** in Ontario.

The primary purpose of the Order is to **correct a fiscal inequity** that arose because the Camp Ipperwash area was treated as an "Indian Settlement" rather than a "reserve" for tax purposes during specific periods — particularly from 1985 onward — despite the fact that reserves are typically designated as distinct, legally protected lands under the *Indian Act*.

This remission recognizes that, under normal circumstances, lands designated as reserves are exempt from certain taxation obligations, and thus, the residents of the settlement should not have been subject to income or goods and services tax (GST) in the same way as non-reserve landowners.

### **Legal Authority**

- The Order is made under **subsection 23(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to make remissions of taxes when it is in the **public interest**.
- It is based on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, indicating that the decision reflects a policy judgment grounded in fairness, equity, and administrative justice.

### **Scope and Application**

- The Order applies **to the Indian Settlement** until the lands are formally set apart as a **reserve** by an order of the Governor in Council.
- Once such a reserve designation is made, this Order ceases to apply.

## **Two Main Provisions of Remission**

---

### **1. Remission of Income Tax (Section 6 – Income Tax Remission)**

#### **Who is eligible?**
- Any **Indian** or **band** whose income is situated on the Camp Ipperwash Indian Settlement.

#### **When does it apply?**
- For each **taxation year or fiscal period beginning on or after calendar year 1985**.

#### **What is remitted?**
- The amount by which the **actual taxes, interest, and penalties** paid or payable exceed:
  - The amount that **would have been payable** if the Indian Settlement had been a **reserve** throughout that year.

> In simpler terms: If a resident or band had to pay income tax because the land was not considered a reserve, the Order refunds the difference — i.e., the overpayment due to the non-reserve status.

#### **Conditions for Remission (for Indians):**
- The tax **must not have already been**:
  - Rebated, credited, refunded, or remitted under:
    - Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* (GST-related)
    - The *Financial Administration Act*
- A **written claim** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the tax was paid.

#### **Conditions for Remission (for Bands):**
- Same condition regarding prior remittance or refund.
- **For tax paid between January 1, 1991, and the date the Order comes into force**:  
  → Claim must be filed within **two years after the Order comes into force**.
- **For tax paid on or after the Order’s effective date**:  
  → Claim must be filed within **two years after the tax was paid**.

> This distinction reflects the timing of when the settlement was formally recognized or when the band began to operate under different tax conditions.

### **2. Remission of Goods and Services Tax (GST) (Section 6 – GST Remission)**

#### **Who is eligible?**
- An **Indian** or a **band** that received a **taxable supply** (e.g., goods or services) made **on or delivered to the Indian Settlement**.

#### **When does it apply?**
- Supplies made **on or after the date this Order comes into force** (for Indians).
- Supplies made **on or after January 1, 1991** (for bands).

#### **What is remitted?**
- The amount by which the **actual GST paid or payable** exceeds:
  - The GST that **would have been payable** if the Indian Settlement had been a **reserve** at the time of supply.

> Example: If a business sold goods to the settlement in 1992, and the settlement was not a reserve, the business would have had to pay GST. Under this Order, the difference between what was actually paid and what would have been paid if it were a reserve is refunded.

#### **Conditions for GST Remission:**
- The tax must **not have previously been**:
  - Rebated, credited, refunded, or remitted under:
    - Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*
    - The *Financial Administration Act*
- A **written claim** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the tax payment date:
  - For tax paid **on or after the Order’s effective date**.
  - For tax paid **between Jan 1, 1991, and the Order’s effective date**, the claim must be filed within **two years after the Order comes into force**.

### **Geographic Description of the Indian Settlement**

The lands comprising the Camp Ipperwash Indian Settlement are located in the **Township of Bosanquet, County of Lambton, Province of Ontario**, and are specifically described as follows:

#### **Included Lands (Part 1):**
- Part of Lots 1 and 2, all of Lots 3 to 7 inclusive, **Concession A**
- Part of Lots 1 and 2, all of Lots 3 to 8 inclusive, **Concession B**

- Road allowances (road strips or rights-of-way)

> This means that only the specified parcels are eligible for remission — not the entire township or surrounding areas.

### **Significance and Public Interest Rationale**

- The Order addresses a **long-standing inequity**: despite the fact that the Camp Ipperwash area was inhabited and used by the **Camp Ipperwash First Nation**, it was not officially designated as a reserve under the *Indian Act*, thus subjecting residents and businesses to taxation obligations that would not apply if it were a reserve.
- By granting remission, the government acknowledges that:
  - The land was **used as a community settlement**.
  - The **lack of reserve status** led to **unjust tax burdens**.
  - The **public interest** in equity, reconciliation, and fair treatment of Indigenous communities justifies the remission.

This Order is part of a broader trend in Canadian policy to recognize the **historical and legal status** of Indigenous communities and to correct past injustices related to land and taxation.
