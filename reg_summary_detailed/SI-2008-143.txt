## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

### 📌 **1. Legal Context and Authority**

- **Statutory Basis**:  
  The regulation is grounded in **section 83.05(1)b and (9)d of the Criminal Code of Canada (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46)**, as amended by:
  - **S.C. 2005, c. 10, s. 18(3)** (amending the definition of "terrorist entity")
  - **SOR/2002-284** (the original regulation establishing the list)
  - **S.C. 2005, c. 10, subpar. 34(1)(f)(iii)** (providing further criteria for listing)

- **Section 83.05(1)b** establishes the initial framework for creating a list of entities believed to be involved in terrorist activities.
- **Section 83.05(9)d** grants the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** the authority to:
  - Review the existing list of listed entities;
  - Determine whether there are **reasonable grounds to believe** that each entity has:
    - Known or participated in, attempted to carry out, or facilitated a terrorist activity;
    - Or is currently acting on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with such an entity.

- The Minister’s determination must be based on **objective, credible evidence** and must reflect current intelligence and assessments.

### 📌 **2. Key Provisions of the Regulation**

#### ✅ **Review Trigger**
- The review was initiated on **July 23, 2008**, six years after the original list was established.
- The list as of that date was examined in full, including all entities then designated as "listed entities."

#### ✅ **Decision Outcome**
- The Minister concluded that **there remain reasonable grounds to believe** that **each of the listed entities** continues to:
  - Be involved in or facilitate terrorist activities;
  - Or act in association with known terrorist groups.

> Therefore, **the Governor in Council (the federal government)** formally **accepts the Minister’s recommendation** that **all entities listed as of July 23, 2008, remain on the official terrorist entity list**.

This means the status of these groups is **not being removed or updated** — they are **retained indefinitely** under Canadian law for the purposes of counter-terrorism policy and enforcement.
