These goods are eligible for a **preferential customs duty rate** under **paragraph 1(b) of Supplementary Note 1 to Section XI of the List of Tariff Provisions**, provided all the following conditions are met:

---

### **4. Eligibility Conditions (Prerequisites for Preferential Duty)**

To qualify for the reduced or preferential duty rate, the imported woollen fabrics must satisfy **all four conditions**:

#### **(a) Minimum 50% Cost of Production in a Commonwealth Country or Canada**
- At least **50% of the total cost of producing** the goods must have been incurred in:
  - One or more **Commonwealth countries**, or
  - **Canada’s own industry**

> This ensures that the goods have a significant portion of their manufacturing value generated within a member of the Commonwealth or Canada.

#### **(b) Finished in Commonwealth Country at Time of Import**
- The goods must be **finished (i.e., fully manufactured and ready for sale)** in a **Commonwealth country** in the **form in which they are imported into Canada**.
- This means the final product (e.g., woven fabric, finished textile) must not have undergone further processing or alteration after completion in the country of origin.

#### **(c) Proof of Origin Required**
- The importer must provide **valid proof of origin** in accordance with the *Customs Act*.
- This typically involves submitting a **certificate of origin** issued by an authorized body in the country of origin, verifying that the goods meet the origin criteria.

#### **(d) Direct Shipment to Canada (With or Without Transhipment)**
- The goods must be **shipped directly to Canada** from a Commonwealth country.
- This includes **direct shipment** or **transshipment** (i.e., passing through another country en route to Canada), **as long as the final destination is Canada**.

> *Exception for Lesotho, Botswana, and Swaziland (now Eswatini):*
> - Goods originating in **Lesotho, Botswana, or Swaziland** are deemed to be **shipped directly to Canada** if they are transported **directly on a through bill of lading from South Africa to a consignee in Canada**, regardless of whether transshipment occurs.

> *Note: This exception was introduced to address logistical realities in Southern Africa and ensure that goods from small landlocked nations still qualify for preferential treatment.*

---

### **5. Exclusions from Cost of Production (What is NOT Included)**

When calculating the **50% production cost threshold**, the following costs are **excluded**:

| Excluded Cost | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| Outside packing and related transportation expenses (excluding ordinary retail packaging) | These are incidental to shipping, not part of production cost |
| Gross profit of manufacturer/exporter | Profit is not a cost of production |
| Profit or remuneration of traders, brokers, or dealers | These are commercial margins, not production costs |
| Royalties | Payments for intellectual property or design rights are excluded |
| Customs or excise duties on imported materials | These are post-production taxes, not part of manufacturing cost |
| Carriage, insurance, and other charges from production site to port of shipment | These are logistics costs before export, not part of manufacturing cost |
| Any other costs incurred or likely to be incurred after final manufacturing | Costs after completion (e.g., marketing, distribution) are excluded |

> This ensures that only **actual manufacturing and production costs** are considered in determining whether the 50% threshold is met.

---

### **6. Key Provisions and Interpretations**

- **No duty applies** if the goods fail to meet any of the four eligibility conditions.
- The **duty rate** is set under **paragraph 1(b) of Supplementary Note 1 to Section XI** of the List of Tariff Provisions — this is typically a **zero or reduced duty rate** (common in preferential trade schemes).
- The regulation **does not apply** to goods that are:
  - Partially or wholly manufactured in Canada,
  - Or that do not meet the origin criteria.

- The **"through bill of lading"** rule for Lesotho, Botswana, and Swaziland is a **practical exception** to ensure that goods from these small, landlocked nations can still benefit from preferential treatment despite their geographic isolation.
