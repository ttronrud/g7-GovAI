**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Hog Marketing Levies Order (January 26, 1984)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

The **Alberta Hog Marketing Levies Order** is a regulatory instrument issued by the **Alberta Pork Producers’ Marketing Board** (referred to as the "Board") under **Section 4 of the Alberta Hog Order**, which is part of the *Regulations of the Province of Alberta, Chapter 130 (C.R.C., c. 130)*.

This Order is authorized to establish, impose, and collect **levies on hog producers** in Alberta. It operates within the broader framework of agricultural marketing policy designed to support the economic viability and market stability of the pork industry in the province.

### **2. Title and Citation**

- **Official Title**: *Alberta Hog Marketing Levies Order*  
- **Date of Issuance**: January 26, 1984  
- **Citation**: This Order may be cited as the *Alberta Hog Marketing Levies Order*.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

The Order defines key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Marketing of Agricultural Products Act* of Alberta. This Act provides the legal foundation for the regulation and oversight of agricultural product marketing, including the establishment of levies and the role of the Board.

- **Board**: The *Alberta Pork Producers Development Corporation*, established under the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act. The Board is responsible for administering the levy system, collecting funds, and using the revenues to support pork marketing, promotion, and development initiatives.

- **Hog**: Any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.*, commonly known as the domestic pig, produced in Alberta.

- **Producer**: A person who engages in the production of hogs within the Province of Alberta. This includes farmers, ranchers, or any individual or entity involved in raising hogs for commercial purposes.

---

### **4. Levy Structure**

The levy is based on the **live weight** of the hogs sold by producers in **interprovincial or export markets**. The rate differs depending on the hog’s size:

| Live Weight | Levy per Hog |
|------------|--------------|
| **50 kg or more** | **$1.00** |
| **Less than 50 kg** | **$0.25** |

- This tiered structure reflects a principle of **cost recovery and market-based fairness**, where larger hogs (which are typically more valuable and may require more resources to produce) are subject to a higher levy.
- The levy applies **only to hogs sold outside of Alberta** (interprovincial or export trade), meaning it does not apply to sales within the province.

---

### **5. Payment Requirements**

- Every producer must pay the applicable levy to the Board **within 15 days** of the end of the month in which the hogs were sold.
- The payment must be made to the **Board’s office in Edmonton, Alberta**.
- The deadline is strict: **by the 15th day of the following month** after the month of sale.

> Example:  
> If hogs are sold in March 1984, the levy must be paid by **April 15, 1984**.

---

### **6. Purpose of the Levy**

Although not explicitly stated in the text, the purpose of this levy can be inferred from the context and the role of the Board:

- To **generate revenue** for the development and promotion of Alberta pork in the broader market.
- To **support marketing efforts**, including branding, advertising, and participation in national or international markets.
- To **ensure market stability** and fair competition by creating a shared financial mechanism among producers.
- To **offset marketing costs** associated with promoting Alberta pork, especially in interprovincial and export channels where the product competes with other regional or imported pork.

---

### **7. Scope and Limitations**

- **Applicability**: Applies only to producers in Alberta.
- **Exclusions**: Does **not apply** to hogs sold within Alberta (intra-provincial sales).
- **Applicability to Sales**: Only applies to **interprovincial or export sales** — not local or regional sales.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not detailed in the Order, enforcement would typically involve:

- The Board monitoring sales records and levy payments.
- Producers being required to report sales and pay the correct levy.
- Potential penalties or enforcement actions for non-compliance (though such provisions are not included in this specific Order).

---

### **9. Historical Context (1984)**

Issued in 1984, this Order reflects a period when Alberta was actively developing its agricultural marketing infrastructure. The use of producer levies was a common mechanism in Canadian agriculture to fund market development, particularly for perishable and value-added products like meat.

This Order predates modern digital tracking and reporting systems, so compliance likely relied on manual record-keeping and periodic audits by the Board.

### **Conclusion**

The *Alberta Hog Marketing Levies Order* of 1984 is a foundational regulatory measure that establishes a fair, tiered levy system to support the marketing of Alberta’s pork industry in external markets. By charging producers based on hog size and requiring timely payment, it ensures that marketing costs are shared equitably and that revenues are available to promote Alberta pork both domestically and internationally. While the Order is dated and may no longer be in force or in current use (due to changes in policy or legislation), it remains a historically significant example of how agricultural marketing levies are structured and administered in Canada.
