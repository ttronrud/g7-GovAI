**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Text:**
> "The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, pursuant to subparagraph 4(1)(c)(iii) of the *Integrated Circuit Topography Act* (*S.C. 1990, c. 37*), hereby certifies that the countries listed in the schedule hereto are countries that confer protection that is substantially equal to the protection conferred by that Act on nationals of Canada and individuals or legal entities that have in Canada a real and effective establishment for the creation of topographies or the manufacture of integrated circuit products."

**Date of Certification:** May 27, 1993  
**Applicable Act:** *Integrated Circuit Topography Act* (S.C. 1990, c. 37)  
**Legal Basis:** Subparagraph 4(1)(c)(iii) of the Act

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This certification is a formal determination by the Canadian government that certain foreign countries provide a level of legal protection for integrated circuit topographies—specifically, the three-dimensional layout or design of semiconductor circuits—that is **substantially equivalent** to the protection offered under Canada’s *Integrated Circuit Topography Act*.

This provision is critical for international trade and intellectual property rights in the semiconductor industry. It enables Canadian nationals and entities with a real and effective establishment in Canada (such as research facilities, manufacturing plants, or design offices) to claim protection in those foreign countries, and vice versa, under reciprocal treatment principles.

### **Key Legal Provisions Involved**

- **Subparagraph 4(1)(c)(iii)** of the *Integrated Circuit Topography Act* allows the Minister to certify that foreign countries offer protection equivalent to Canada’s protection for topographies.  
- This certification serves as a **reciprocity mechanism**, meaning that if a foreign country grants protection to Canadian designers and manufacturers, Canada will recognize such protection in the same way it protects its own nationals and entities.

### **Countries Certified as Offering Substantially Equivalent Protection**

The following countries are certified as providing protection that is **substantially equal** to that provided under Canadian law:

1. Australia  
2. Austria  
3. Belgium  
4. Denmark  
5. Finland  
6. France  
7. Germany  
8. Greece  
9. Iceland  
10. Ireland  
11. Italy  
12. Japan  
13. Luxembourg  
14. Netherlands  
15. Norway  
16. Portugal  
17. Spain  
18. Sweden  
19. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  
20. United States of America  

*(Note: The list is comprehensive and includes major industrialized nations with established semiconductor industries and strong intellectual property frameworks.)*

### **Scope of Protection Recognized**

The certification specifically applies to:

- **Nationality-based protection**: Protection afforded to nationals of the certified countries.
- **Establishment-based protection**: Protection granted to individuals or legal entities that have a **real and effective establishment** in Canada for:
  - The **creation** of topographies (i.e., design of integrated circuits)
  - The **manufacture** of integrated circuit products

This means that if a foreign national or entity has a physical presence (e.g., a design office or manufacturing facility) in Canada, they are entitled to the same level of protection under Canadian law as Canadian nationals or entities.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **International Reciprocity**:  
   This certification establishes a reciprocal relationship between Canada and the listed countries. It ensures that Canadian designers and manufacturers are not disadvantaged when seeking protection abroad, and that foreign designers and manufacturers are not denied protection in Canada.

2. **Support for Innovation and Trade**:  
   By confirming equivalent protection, the regulation fosters innovation in the semiconductor industry by reducing legal uncertainty and encouraging cross-border collaboration and investment.

3. **Legal Enforcement and Enforcement Mechanisms**:  
   The certification allows Canadian courts and intellectual property offices to enforce topography rights in the listed countries, and vice versa, under the principle of mutual recognition.

4. **Compliance with International Standards**:  
   The certification aligns Canada with international practices in intellectual property protection, particularly those of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and other international agreements related to semiconductor design.

5. **Exclusions and Limitations**:  
   - The certification does **not** imply that all aspects of the law are identical. It only confirms that the **level of protection** is "substantially equal."
   - It does not extend to protection for other types of intellectual property (e.g., patents, trademarks).
   - The certification is **not automatic**—it is subject to periodic review and may be revised if foreign laws change significantly.

---

### **Background and Context**

- The *Integrated Circuit Topography Act* was enacted in 1990 to protect the design of integrated circuits, which are fundamental to modern electronics.
- Before this certification, Canada had to rely on bilateral agreements or national laws to determine whether foreign countries offered equivalent protection.
- The 1993 certification was a significant step in formalizing Canada’s international IP framework, especially in a high-tech sector where design protection is crucial.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a foundational element of Canada’s intellectual property policy in the semiconductor industry. By certifying that key global economies offer protection substantially equivalent to Canada’s, it ensures that Canadian innovators and businesses can operate with confidence in international markets. It also strengthens Canada’s position as a reliable and fair participant in global technology and design rights frameworks.

This certification remains valid unless amended or revoked by the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, and is typically reviewed periodically to reflect changes in international IP laws.
