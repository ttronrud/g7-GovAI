The regulation you have provided is a **Supplemental Instrument (Statutory Instrument)** issued under the authority of the Canadian government, specifically through the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**. It is rooted in the **Agricultural and Rural Development Act (ARDA)** and concerns the **revocation of a prior Order in Council** and the **designation of a new minister** with specific responsibilities under that Act.

Here is a **detailed summary** of the regulation:

---

### **1. Revocation of Prior Order in Council**
- **Prior Order**: Order in Council P.C. 1984-2290, dated June 28, 1984, was previously issued to establish certain administrative or procedural arrangements under the Agricultural and Rural Development Act (ARDA).
- **Action Taken**: This regulation formally **revokes** that earlier Order in Council.
- **Purpose of Revocation**: The revocation indicates a change in administrative structure or policy direction. It may reflect:
  - A shift in government priorities regarding rural development.
  - A reorganization of ministerial responsibilities.
  - The need to correct outdated or obsolete provisions in the regulatory framework.
- **Legal Authority**: The revocation is authorized under **Section 2 of the Agricultural and Rural Development Act (ARDA)**, which grants the Governor General in Council the power to make, amend, or revoke orders related to the Act.

### **2. Designation of a Minister for ARDA Purposes**
- **New Designation**: The **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** is formally designated as the **Minister for the purposes of the Agricultural and Rural Development Act (ARDA)**.
- **Role and Authority**: This designation means that the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology now has the **legal and administrative responsibility** to oversee, implement, and make decisions related to ARDA matters—such as rural development programs, agricultural policy, or rural infrastructure initiatives—within the scope of the Act.
- **Implication**: This reflects a **reallocation of ministerial responsibilities**, likely due to:
  - A reorganization of federal departments.
  - A recognition that rural development and agricultural policy are best managed under a ministry with expertise in science, technology, and industrial development.
  - A strategic move to align rural policy with broader economic and technological development goals.

### **3. Legal and Procedural Context**
- **Issuing Authority**: The Governor General in Council acts on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, which is standard practice in Canada for the issuance of Orders in Council.
- **Legal Basis**: The regulation is grounded in **Section 2 of the Agricultural and Rural Development Act (ARDA)**, which enables the government to designate ministers or alter administrative arrangements under the Act.
- **Publication**: The instrument was published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, page 2988**, on **SI/84-104**, indicating it is a formal, legally binding statutory instrument.

### **4. Significance and Impact**
- **Administrative Clarity**: The regulation removes ambiguity by clearly defining who is responsible for ARDA-related functions.
- **Policy Continuity**: Despite the revocation of an old order, the new designation ensures continuity in rural development policy.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination**: It may enhance coordination between agricultural policy and broader economic or technological development initiatives, particularly given the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology’s background.
- **Historical Context**: This change likely occurred during a period of federal restructuring in the 1980s, when government departments were being reorganized to improve efficiency and policy coherence.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a **formal administrative update** to the governance structure of the Agricultural and Rural Development Act. It:
- **Revokes** an outdated Order in Council (P.C. 1984-2290),
- **Designates** the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology as the responsible minister for ARDA purposes,
- And is enacted under the authority of Section 2 of the ARDA.

It reflects a shift in ministerial oversight to better align rural development policy with broader national goals in science, industry, and economic development.

**Note**: This is a non-substantive, procedural regulation. It does not introduce new policy content or funding but rather reorganizes responsibility and removes obsolete provisions. Its significance lies in administrative clarity and interdepartmental coordination.
