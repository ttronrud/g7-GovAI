### 📌 Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **What is SOR?**
- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of Regulations*.
- In Canada, SOR (Supplemental Orders and Regulations) are official documents that implement or amend laws passed by Parliament. They are published in the *Canada Gazette* and are legally binding.

#### 2. **Repeal Meaning**
- "Repealed" means that a specific section (or subsection) of a regulation has been officially **cancelled or removed** from legal effect.
- This typically occurs when a new regulation is introduced that supersedes the old one, or when a law is amended or replaced.

#### 3. **Key Repealed Provisions**
- **SOR/2017-14, s. 416**:  
  This refers to **Section 416** of the **Statutory Instrument of Regulations issued on April 14, 2017** (SOR/2017-14).  
  - This section was **fully repealed** by a subsequent amendment (likely a new regulation or legislative update).
  - It is listed **repeatedly**, indicating that multiple provisions or related sections were affected or that the repeal was applied broadly across several subparts.

- **SOR/84-508, s. 1 and s. 2**:  
  This refers to **Section 1 and Section 2** of the **Statutory Instrument from 1984 (SOR/84-508)**.  
  - These sections were also **repealed** — likely as part of a broader modernization or consolidation of regulations.
  - SOR/84-508 is an older instrument, suggesting these provisions were outdated or inconsistent with current laws.

#### 4. **Contextual Background (Inferred)**
- The repeal of these sections likely occurred to:
  - **Modernize** outdated rules.
  - **Align** regulations with current legislation or policy goals.
  - **Eliminate redundancy** or overlapping provisions.
  - **Improve clarity and enforcement** in areas such as licensing, compliance, or administrative procedures (depending on the original subject matter).

#### 5. **Legal and Practical Implications**
- Once a section is repealed:
  - It is **no longer enforceable**.
  - Any actions or decisions based on it are **invalid or unenforceable**.
  - Legal or regulatory bodies must now refer to the **current, active version** of the regulation.

#### 6. **Why the Repeated Entries?**
- The repetition (over 100 instances) may indicate:
  - A **data entry or formatting error** (e.g., a copy-paste mistake).
  - A **systematic listing** in a database or legal document where each instance references the same repeal.
  - A **search or index** of all affected sections under a particular repeal notice.
