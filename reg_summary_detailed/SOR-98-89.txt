| **Jan 1, 1998 – Dec 31, 2004** | **100%** | Full remission of customs duties on eligible imports |

| **Jan 1, 2008 – Dec 31, 2008** | **Additional 25%** | *Note: This is a second remission layer, meaning total remission = 50% + 25% = 75%* |
| **Jan 1, 2009 – Dec 31, 2009** | **75%** | Returns to 75% after a brief dip |
| **Jan 1, 2010 – Dec 31, 2010** | **50%** | Reduction to 50% |

---

## **8. Legal Basis**

- Enacted under **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.))**, which allows the Governor in Council (on recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to make remission orders for specific goods.
- This demonstrates a **fiscal policy tool** used to stimulate domestic manufacturing in the women’s apparel sector.

---

## **9. Policy Objectives**

1. **Support Canadian Manufacturing**  
   Reduce costs for manufacturers, making it more viable to produce women’s apparel domestically.

2. **Promote Domestic Design and Retail Integration**  
   Encourage the creation of coordinated apparel sets that appeal to consumers.

3. **Encourage Economic Growth in Specific Sectors**  
   Provide targeted support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the fashion industry.

4. **Ensure Fiscal Responsibility**  
   Limit total remission to a cap based on 1995 import levels to prevent undue financial burden on the government.

---

## **10. Limitations and Considerations**

- **No benefit for non-manufacturers or importers** — Only applies to manufacturers who import inputs for production.
- **Excludes athletic and outerwear items** — Ensures the program remains focused on core women’s fashion.
- **No automatic remission** — Claims must be filed within five years; failure to do so results in forfeiture.
- **Limited to specific years** — The program ended by 2012, with no extension beyond that period.

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Blouses, Shirts and Co-ordinates Remission Order, 1998* is a **targeted, time-limited fiscal incentive** designed to support Canadian manufacturers in the women’s apparel sector. It provides **progressive reductions in customs duties** over a 15-year period, beginning in 1998 and ending in 2012, with full remission initially followed by phased reductions. The program is strictly defined in terms of product type, eligible companies, and claim conditions, ensuring both effectiveness and fiscal accountability.

While the program has expired (as of 2012), it represents a significant example of how Canadian trade policy can be used to **stimulate domestic production** in specific industries through **customs duty remission**.

---

It is limited to specific manufacturers, requires claims within five years of import, and is capped at the total duty remitted in 1995. The policy supports domestic manufacturing and fashion design while maintaining fiscal discipline.
