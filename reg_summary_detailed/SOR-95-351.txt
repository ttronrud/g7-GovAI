The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of specific sections of a regulatory instrument under the *Statutory Instruments (SOR)* series:

- **SOR/2012-69, s. 136** – This indicates that Section 136 of the Statutory Instrument numbered 69 issued in 2012 has been repealed.
- **SOR/2002-275, s. 2** – This indicates that Section 2 of the Statutory Instrument numbered 275 issued in 2002 has also been repealed.

Each of these references appears multiple times (six times for SOR/2012-69, once for SOR/2002-275), which suggests a redundancy or formatting error, possibly due to a copy-paste or data input issue.

### Detailed Summary:

**Summary of the Regulation (as indicated by the repeal notices):**

The regulation in question — originally comprising Section 2 of SOR/2002-275 and Section 136 of SOR/2012-69 — has been **fully repealed**. This means:

1. **SOR/2002-275, s. 2**  
   - This section was a previously enacted regulatory provision, likely related to a specific area of law such as environmental protection, health, safety, or financial regulation (the exact subject depends on the original instrument).
   - It has been formally removed from legal force through the repeal process.

2. **SOR/2012-69, s. 136**  
   - This section was part of a 2012 Statutory Instrument, which may have addressed administrative procedures, licensing, or compliance requirements.
   - It has also been formally revoked, meaning it no longer applies or creates legal obligations.

**Reason for Repeal:**  
The repeal of these sections typically occurs when:
- The original regulation is outdated or no longer relevant.
- A new regulatory framework has been introduced that supersedes it.
- There is a need to simplify or modernize legislation.
- The provision was found to be inconsistent with current laws or public policy.

**Legal Implications:**  
- Any legal action, compliance requirement, or administrative decision based on these repealed sections is no longer valid.
- Entities or individuals relying on these provisions must now refer to current, active regulations.
- The repeal is effective as of the date the Statutory Instrument was published (in this case, SOR/2012-69 was issued in 2012, and the repeal would take effect upon publication).

**Note on Redundancy:**  
The repeated listing of "Repealed, SOR/2012-69, s. 136" appears to be a technical or formatting error. It does not indicate multiple distinct regulations being repealed, but rather a duplication of the same repeal notice.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does not represent an active regulation, but rather a **record of repeals**. The regulation referenced (Sections 2 of SOR/2002-275 and 136 of SOR/2012-69) has been **fully and officially repealed** and is no longer in force. Therefore, there is **no active regulatory content** to summarize — only a historical record of legislative removal.

For further details on the original content of these sections, one would need to consult the archived versions of SOR/2002-275 and SOR/2012-69, which may be accessible through official government databases such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Statutes* portal.
