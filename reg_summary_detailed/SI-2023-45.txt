**Regulatory Summary: Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2022-1104 and Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 3 of the *Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act*** (S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 235). This provision grants the Governor General in Council (the federal government) the power to amend, repeal, or modify orders made under the Act, particularly in relation to administrative or procedural matters.

The Act itself was introduced in 2022 to restrict non-Canadians from purchasing residential property in Canada, with the stated aim of protecting the housing market and ensuring affordability for Canadian citizens and residents.

**2. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2022-1104**  
- The regulation **repeals (officially cancels or withdraws)** *Order in Council P.C. 2022-1104*, issued on October 19, 2022.  
- This prior order likely contained specific administrative provisions or implementation details related to the enforcement of the residential property purchase restriction for non-Canadians.  
- By repealing this order, the government is effectively **removing the previous administrative framework** that may have governed the application, interpretation, or enforcement of the property purchase ban.  
- The repeal suggests a shift in policy or administrative approach—possibly due to legal challenges, changes in policy direction, or the need for a more streamlined or updated implementation mechanism.

---

**3. Designation of the Minister for the Purposes of the Act**  
- The regulation **designates the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** (a federal cabinet-level minister) as the **Minister responsible for administering and enforcing the provisions of the *Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act***.  
- This designation is significant because it assigns **formal administrative responsibility** for the Act to a specific government department.  
- The Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is typically responsible for housing policy, community development, and urban planning—making this designation both practical and aligned with existing policy priorities.  
- This ensures that decisions related to enforcement, compliance, and policy implementation are coordinated through a central, accountable ministerial office.

**4. Implications and Significance**  
- **Policy Clarity**: By repealing the earlier order and designating a specific minister, the government provides greater clarity and accountability in how the law will be administered.  
- **Administrative Efficiency**: It streamlines enforcement by assigning responsibility to a single, experienced minister with relevant portfolio responsibilities.  
- **Potential Policy Shift**: The repeal of P.C. 2022-1104 may signal a move away from rigid or overly prescriptive implementation rules, possibly in favor of more flexible or targeted enforcement.  
- **Legal Continuity**: Despite the repeal of the prior order, the substantive prohibition on non-Canadians purchasing residential property remains in force under the Act itself. The repeal only affects procedural or administrative details, not the core legislative restriction.

**5. Regulatory Citation and Source**  
- **Regulation**: Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under section 3 of the *Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act*, S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 235.  
- **Repealed Order**: P.C. 2022-1104 (October 19, 2022)  
- **Designated Regulation**: SI/2022-53 (a Statutory Instrument, or "Order in Council," issued in 2022)

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a formal administrative update to the implementation of the 2022 residential property purchase restriction for non-Canadians. It removes an earlier, possibly outdated or contested administrative order and assigns the responsibility for enforcement to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. While the core restriction on property purchases remains in place, this change enhances accountability, policy coherence, and administrative efficiency in its application.

*Note: As of the date of this summary, this regulation is not a change to the substantive law (i.e., the ban on non-Canadian purchases remains), but rather a procedural and administrative update to how the law is implemented.*
