**Detailed Summary of the B.C. Place Replacement Turf Remission Order, 1995**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)). This provision allows the government to grant remissions (i.e., waivers or reductions) of customs duties under specific conditions, typically for public or infrastructure-related projects.

The Order is formally titled:  
**"The B.C. Place Replacement Turf Remission Order, 1995."**

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **remit (waive) customs duties** on specific imported goods used to **replace and/or repair the artificial turf and rubber backing** at **B.C. Place**, the major stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia. The remission supports the maintenance and improvement of public infrastructure, specifically the playing field at the venue.

---

**3. Goods Covered by the Remission**  
The remission applies to the following two types of goods under the Customs Tariff:

- **Artificial turf** – specifically under **tariff item No. 5603.00.10**  
- **Cyclized rubber sheets (rubber backing)** – specifically under **tariff item No. 5701.90.10**

These items are imported by or on behalf of the **British Columbia Pavilion Corporation (BCPC)**, a designated entity responsible for managing the B.C. Place facility.

---

**4. Scope and Timing of the Remission**  
The remission applies only to goods imported into Canada during a defined period:  
- **From February 1, 1993, to December 31, 1997**  
This timeframe limits the eligibility of imports to those made within this five-year window, ensuring the remission is tied to a specific project timeline.

---

**5. Conditions for Remission**  
To qualify for the remission, the following conditions must be met:

- **Importation Date Requirement**: The goods must have been imported into Canada between **February 1, 1993, and December 31, 1997**.  
- **Timely Claim Submission**: A formal claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **three years of the date of importation**.  
  - This means that claims must be filed by **no later than three years after the import date** (e.g., if goods were imported in December 1995, the claim must be submitted by December 1998).

---

**6. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The remission is **not a general exemption** but a **specific, targeted relief** for a defined project (B.C. Place field replacement/repair).  
- It operates under the **customs duty framework** of the Canadian Tariff, meaning that duties would otherwise be payable on these goods as per Schedule I of the Customs Tariff.  
- The requirement to file a claim within three years ensures accountability and compliance with customs procedures, preventing indefinite or unmonitored waivers.

**7. Significance and Context**  
This Order reflects a common use of federal regulatory power to support **public infrastructure development** or **renewal of public facilities**. By waiving duties on specialized materials (artificial turf and rubber backing), the government enables cost-effective upgrades to a major civic venue without placing a financial burden on the responsible entity (BCPC). It also underscores the role of the federal government in facilitating public service improvements through targeted fiscal measures.

**8. Citation and Reference**  
The Order may be cited as:  
**B.C. Place Replacement Turf Remission Order, 1995**  
It is part of the broader **Customs Tariff** legislation (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)) and is enforceable under the authority granted by Section 101.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation provides a legally binding, time-limited, and conditionally granted remission of customs duties on specific imported materials used for the renovation of B.C. Place. It is a targeted fiscal intervention designed to support public infrastructure, with clear eligibility criteria and administrative requirements to ensure compliance and accountability. The Order remains in effect only for goods imported within the specified period and claims submitted within the required timeframe.
