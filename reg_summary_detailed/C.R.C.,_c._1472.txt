**Detailed Summary of the *Ship Radio Inspection Fees Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is titled the **Ship Radio Inspection Fees Regulations** and may be cited as such. It establishes the fee structure for radio inspections conducted by Canadian radio inspectors under the authority of the *Canada Shipping Act*.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Canada Shipping Act*, which provides the legal framework for maritime safety, including requirements related to radio installations on ships.
  
- **"Certificate"**: Includes:
  - A *Safety Convention certificate* issued under the *Canada Shipping Act*, or
  - A *radio inspection certificate* issued to a ship that is required to have a radio installation under the Act or regulations made thereunder.

- **"Department"**: Refers to the **Department of Transport**, responsible for overseeing maritime safety and enforcing radio inspection requirements.

> Note: The terms **"life boat radio inspection"**, **"radiotelegraph inspection"**, and **"radiotelephone inspection"** have been **revoked** (cancelled) by *SOR/78-668, section 1*. This means these specific inspection types are no longer governed by these regulations and are obsolete.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to:
- **Canadian ships** (registered in Canada), and  
- **Ships registered outside of Canada**.

This ensures that all vessels—regardless of nationality—subject to Canadian radio safety requirements must comply with the fee structure for radio inspections.

---

### **4. Fee Structure for Radio Inspections**

A fee must be paid for each inspection conducted by a **radio inspector** of the Department and consists of two components:

#### **(a) Reimbursement for Expenses**
The fee includes the amount of every expense that the inspector would normally be reimbursed for under the **Treasury Board Travel Directive**, as amended or revised from time to time.  
This covers costs such as:
- Transportation
- Accommodation
- Meals
- Other travel-related expenses

#### **(b) Compensation for Working Outside Regular Hours**
If any portion of the inspection occurs **outside the inspector’s regular working hours**, an additional amount must be paid equal to the compensation that would normally be payable to the inspector during that time.

This compensation is based on the **Agreement signed on August 26, 1977**, between:
- The **Treasury Board** of Canada and  
- The **International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 2228, Electronics Group (all employees)**.

This agreement sets the hourly wage for inspectors working beyond standard hours. Any subsequent agreement replacing this one will govern compensation in place of the original.

> This ensures that inspectors are fairly compensated for time spent on inspections outside standard working hours, reflecting labor market standards.

---

### **5. Payment Requirements by Ship Type**

#### **(a) Canadian Ships**
- The **owner** of the ship is responsible for paying the fee.
- Payment must be made **upon receipt of an invoice** issued by the Department following the inspection.

> This creates a clear, transparent process where the owner is financially accountable and receives a formal billing record.

#### **(b) Foreign-Registered Ships**
- No certificate (e.g., radio inspection certificate) certifying compliance with Canadian radio requirements can be issued **until** the radio inspector has received **written authorization** from one of the following:
  - The **master of the ship**, or a person authorized by the master, **OR**
  - The **owner or agent of the ship**

> This requirement ensures that foreign-registered vessels do not receive certification without explicit consent from the ship’s responsible party, promoting accountability and financial responsibility.

---

### **6. Exemption Clause**

**Exception**: The fee does **not apply** to ships registered in the **United States** when:
- The ship’s **radiotelephone installation** has been inspected,
- For the purpose of issuing a certificate that is valid for a period enabling the ship to:
  - Proceed to a **Great Lakes port in the United States**, and
  - Undergo a **U.S. government inspection** by a U.S. officer.

This exemption is based on the **Agreement between Canada and the United States for the Promotion of Safety on the Great Lakes by Means of Radio**.

> This provision reflects a **bilateral cooperation agreement** to enhance maritime safety on the Great Lakes. It allows for mutual recognition of inspection results and avoids duplicate or redundant fees for vessels transiting between the two countries, promoting efficiency and safety in shared waters.

- **Financial Accountability**: Ensures that shipowners bear the cost of inspections, promoting compliance and transparency.
- **Fair Compensation**: Protects inspectors’ rights by providing proper reimbursement and compensation for overtime.
- **International Cooperation**: The exemption for Great Lakes vessels reflects a cooperative, safety-focused approach between Canada and the U.S., reducing administrative burden and enhancing operational efficiency.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ship Radio Inspection Fees Regulations* provide a clear, equitable, and practical framework for charging fees for radio inspections of ships. By balancing financial accountability with international cooperation, the regulations support both maritime safety and operational efficiency while ensuring fair treatment of inspectors and responsible shipowners. The inclusion of an exemption for U.S.-registered vessels navigating the Great Lakes demonstrates Canada’s commitment to regional safety collaboration.
