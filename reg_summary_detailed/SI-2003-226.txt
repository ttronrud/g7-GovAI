**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The regulation in question is a formal executive order issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. It is grounded in the authority conferred under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Transfer of Responsibility**:  
   The regulation transfers the **control and supervision** of the **Parks Canada Agency** from the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** to the **Minister of the Environment**.

2. **Effective Date**:  
   The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. This date marks the point at which the new administrative oversight begins, and all responsibilities, management functions, and policy direction of Parks Canada are formally placed under the jurisdiction of the Minister of the Environment.

3. **Legal Authority**:  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign duties and control over public service agencies. This provision allows for the reallocation of responsibilities among federal ministers to better align with policy priorities, organizational efficiency, or sectoral focus.

4. **Nature of the Transfer**:  
   The regulation specifies that it is a transfer of **control and supervision**, not ownership or funding. This means that while the Minister of the Environment assumes responsibility for managing and directing the operations of Parks Canada, the agency itself remains a federal public service entity. The transfer does not alter the agency’s statutory mandate or its role in managing Canada’s national parks and protected areas.

5. **Policy and Strategic Rationale (Implied Context)**:  
   The shift reflects a broader governmental strategy to align environmental and natural resource management under the purview of the Minister of the Environment. Parks Canada’s core mandate—protecting and managing Canada’s natural heritage, including national parks, marine parks, and other protected areas—aligns closely with environmental conservation, climate change, biodiversity, and ecosystem stewardship. Placing it under the Ministry of the Environment strengthens coordination between park management and broader environmental policy objectives.

6. **Impact on Operations**:  
   Following the transfer, the Parks Canada Agency would operate under the strategic direction, policy guidance, and performance accountability of the Minister of the Environment. This may include changes in reporting lines, interdepartmental coordination, and integration with other environmental initiatives such as climate action, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation.

**Conclusion**:  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal government. It reflects a shift in ministerial responsibility to better reflect the environmental and ecological focus of Parks Canada’s mission. By transferring control to the Minister of the Environment, the government ensures that national parks and protected areas are managed within a coherent, integrated environmental policy framework, enhancing policy coherence and interdepartmental collaboration in environmental stewardship.
