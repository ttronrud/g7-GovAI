**Detailed Summary of the *Weather Modification Information Regulations***

---

### **Regulation Title and Citation**  
These regulations are officially titled the **Weather Modification Information Regulations** and may be cited as such. They implement and provide operational detail for the *Weather Modification Information Act* (the "Act").

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Weather Modification Information Act*, which establishes the legal framework governing weather modification activities in Canada. This regulation provides the procedural and informational requirements under that Act.

2. **"Weather Modifier"**  
   Defined as *any person who engages in any weather modification activity*. This includes individuals, organizations, or entities conducting operations such as cloud seeding, fog dispersal, or precipitation enhancement.

---

### **Administrative Authority**

- The **Assistant Deputy Minister of the Atmospheric Environment Service, Department of the Environment**, is designated as the **Administrator** of the Act and these Regulations.
- The Administrator has oversight responsibility for receiving, reviewing, and managing information related to proposed and ongoing weather modification activities.

- Estimate of any **adjacent or off-site areas** that may be affected
- Approximate total cost of the activity
- Approximate total funds to be spent in Canada
- General operational periods (e.g., “only during warm fog days”)

---

#### **G. Operations and Techniques**
- General methods and techniques to be used
- Principles or scientific models/hypotheses underlying the modification (e.g., ice nucleation theory)
- Brief description of specific operational procedures

  - Dispersal rates (per hour, per period)
  - Maximum emission rates
  - Total quantities to be dispersed
  - Expected hours of operation (daily and total)
  - Any known toxic, corrosive, or harmful effects (even minor); if not known, a risk assessment must be provided
