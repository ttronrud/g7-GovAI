### **Detailed Summary of the Exemption List Regulations (S.C. 1998, c. 25)**  
*Under the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act (MVRMA)*

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

These **Exemption List Regulations** were enacted under **subsection 143(1)(c)** of the *Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act (MVRMA)*, following consultation with:
- The **Minister of Resources, Wildlife and Economic Development (NW Territories)**  
- **First Nations** communities

The purpose of the regulations is to **identify specific activities and developments that are exempt from requiring a full environmental assessment or land use permit** under the MVRMA — provided they meet strict, defined criteria.

This exemption applies only to **developments or operations that have negligible environmental impact** on the Mackenzie Valley, particularly in terms of:
- Waste discharge into water bodies  
- Land use changes  
- Disruption to sensitive ecosystems or heritage sites  

Exemptions are **not blanket** — they are narrowly defined and conditional.

| **Hook-up** | Connection to utility lines (gas, water, sewer, electricity, telecom) |
| **International electrical transmission line** | Line transmitting electricity across Canada or to/from outside Canada — *excluded from exemption* |
| **Irrigation structure** | Buried pipeline, pump, reservoir, etc., used for agricultural irrigation |
| **Limited expansion** | Increase of ≤10% in exterior dimensions or production capacity |
| **Modification** | Change to a structure that does not alter its purpose or function |
| **National historic site** | Designated under the *Historic Sites and Monuments Act* |
| **National park / reserve** | Parks/reserves under federal jurisdiction (Canada National Parks Act) |
| **Northwest Territories territorial park** | Defined under *Territorial Parks Act* |
| **Oil and gas pipeline** | Pipeline used for transmission of hydrocarbons |
