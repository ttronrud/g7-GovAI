**Detailed Summary of the United States Surtax Remission Order (Motor Vehicles 2025)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
The *United States Surtax Remission Order (Motor Vehicles 2025)* is made under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)), and is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This legislative instrument provides a statutory mechanism for remitting (i.e., refunding or waiving) certain surtaxes imposed on motor vehicles imported from the United States.

The Order is **effective upon its issuance** (i.e., the day it is made), and is numbered **SI/2025-60**.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant remission of surtaxes** that were paid or are payable under the *United States Surtax Order (Motor Vehicles 2025)* — a prior regulatory instrument that imposed additional taxes on specific motor vehicles imported from the United States. The remission is intended to:
- Support the importation of U.S.-manufactured motor vehicles into Canada;
- Encourage fair and transparent trade practices;
- Facilitate compliance with Canadian customs and trade regulations;
- Promote transparency and information sharing between key federal departments.

---

### **3. Definitions**
The Order includes the following key definitions:

- **Importer**: A person who holds a valid **business number** (a unique identifier assigned by the Canada Revenue Agency) listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule**. This defines eligibility for remission.
  
- **Schedule**: The detailed list of importers and the number of motor vehicles to which remission applies. The schedule has been **approved by the Governor in Council** but is **not published publicly** due to **confidentiality concerns** (e.g., sensitive business or operational information). It remains an unpublished annex to the Order.

---

### **4. Scope of Remission**
Remission is granted to **specific importers** who meet the following criteria:

- The remission applies to a **specific number of motor vehicles** listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**, corresponding to the importer’s business number.
- The remission is **limited to motor vehicles imported**:
  - **On or after April 9, 2025**, and
  - **No later than April 8, 2026**.

This creates a **time-bound window** for importation and eligibility.

---

### **5. Conditions for Remission**
To qualify for remission, the importer must satisfy **all of the following conditions**:

#### **(a) Timely Claim Submission**
- The importer must **submit a claim for remission** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** within **two years of the date of importation**.

> *Note: This two-year window is critical and must be respected to maintain eligibility.*

#### **(b) Information Disclosure Requirements**
The importer is required to provide **full and accurate information** to both:
- The **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, and
- The **Minister of Industry**

Specifically, the importer must provide information regarding:
- The **importing into Canada** and **sale in Canada** of U.S.-manufactured motor vehicles;
- The **manufacture of motor vehicles in Canada** and the **origin of goods used in Canadian manufacturing** (e.g., parts or components sourced from Canada or elsewhere).

This requirement ensures **transparency** in supply chains and supports national policy objectives related to trade, safety, and industrial development.

#### **(c) Manufacturing Continuity (for Canadian Manufacturers)**
If an importer has **reduced or paused manufacturing in Canada** due to **factory retooling**, they must:
- **Restart manufacturing** in accordance with the requirements established by:
  - The **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, and
  - The **Minister of Industry**.

This condition ensures that any temporary suspension of Canadian production does not undermine Canada’s industrial capacity or regulatory oversight.

#### **(d) No Prior Relief Claim**
No other claim for surtax relief (i.e., remission or exemption) has been granted under the **Customs Tariff** for the same motor vehicle.

> This prevents double relief and ensures the integrity of the surtax regime.

---

### **6. Schedule Replacement**
The Order **replaces the previous schedule** (as defined in section 1 of the original *United States Surtax Remission Order (Motor Vehicles 2025)*), with a **new, unpublished schedule** under **section 115b of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 1997, c. 36).

> This replacement is necessary to reflect updated importers, vehicle volumes, or eligibility criteria, and to maintain regulatory accuracy. The **unpublished nature** of the schedule protects sensitive commercial or operational data from public disclosure.

---

### **7. Key Implications and Considerations**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Eligibility** | Only specific importers (with listed business numbers) can claim remission. |
| **Time Limit** | Importation must occur between April 9, 2025, and April 8, 2026. Claims must be submitted within two years of importation. |
| **Transparency** | Importers must provide detailed information to two federal Ministers — emphasizing accountability and supply chain oversight. |
| **Canadian Manufacturing** | Any importer that pauses Canadian production must restart under government-defined conditions — promoting industrial continuity. |
| **Confidentiality** | The schedule is not publicly available, protecting business interests. |
| **No Double Relief** | Prevents overlapping or redundant claims, ensuring fair application of the surtax regime. |

---

### **8. Regulatory Context**
This Order operates within the broader framework of:
- The **Customs Tariff**, which governs duties, taxes, and trade-related obligations;
- The **United States Surtax Order (Motor Vehicles 2025)**, which originally imposed a surtax on certain U.S.-made motor vehicles;
- Federal coordination between **Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (safety, vehicle standards) and **Industry** (manufacturing, supply chain, competitiveness).

It reflects a targeted policy response to balance **trade facilitation**, **national safety standards**, and **industrial policy objectives**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *United States Surtax Remission Order (Motor Vehicles 2025)* is a **targeted, time-limited, and conditionally granted** relief measure designed to:
- Support the importation of U.S.-manufactured motor vehicles into Canada;
- Ensure compliance with safety, manufacturing, and trade regulations;
- Promote transparency and accountability in the supply chain;
- Protect sensitive business information through confidentiality provisions.

Importers must strictly adhere to eligibility criteria, timelines, and reporting obligations to qualify for remission. The Order underscores the federal government’s emphasis on **coordinated regulatory oversight** across departments and the importance of **data transparency** in trade policy.

**Final Note**: This Order is **not a general tax relief** or exemption. It applies only to specific importers and vehicles within a defined time frame and under strict conditions.
