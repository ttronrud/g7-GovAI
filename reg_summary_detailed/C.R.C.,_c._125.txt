### **Detailed Summary of the Yarmouth Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Yarmouth Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish zoning and land-use restrictions specifically designed to ensure the safe operation of aircraft at Yarmouth Airport by controlling the height and development of structures, natural growth, and land use near the airport.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Yarmouth Airport, located in the County of Yarmouth, Province of Nova Scotia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A designated geographic point used as a baseline for elevation measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 106 feet above sea level** for regulatory purposes. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending outward and upward from the ends of runways: <br> - For **Runway 06–24**: 50 feet horizontally to 1 foot vertically (1:50 slope). <br> - For **Runway 15–33**: 40 feet horizontally to 1 foot vertically (1:40 slope). <br> These surfaces begin at the ends of the runway and extend outward to specified distances. They are illustrated on **Plan No. MT-0150 (A, B, C)**, dated November 6, 1967, held in the Department of Transport, Ottawa. |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **150 feet above the elevation of the Airport Reference Point** (i.e., 106 ft + 150 ft = 256 ft above sea level). This surface serves as a key benchmark for permissible structure heights. |
| **Strip** | A designated rectangular area of the airport prepared for takeoff and landing, including runways. Dimensions are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**: <br> - **Runway 06–24**: 1,200 feet wide (600 ft on each side), 6,600 feet long. <br> - **Runway 15–33**: 1,000 feet wide (500 ft on each side), 5,400 feet long. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the outer edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, at a ratio of **7 feet horizontally to 1 foot vertically** (1:7 slope), until it intersects the horizontal surface or another transitional surface. Also shown on **Plan MT-0150 (A, B, C)**. |

#### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to all lands **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Yarmouth Airport**, with outer boundaries precisely described in a detailed legal description (a "metes and bounds" description). The boundary includes:

- Starting at the intersection of the **southwesterly boundary of Wyman Road** and the **westerly boundary of a road leading to Pinkney Point**.
- Proceeding through various lot lines, shoreline boundaries (Yarmouth Sound, Yarmouth Harbor, Milo Lake, Telfry Lake, Chebogue River), and highways.
- Ending at the **intersection of the southeasterly boundary of Grove Road and the southwesterly boundary of Vancouver Street**, and including **Bunker Island**.

> ✅ **Important Note**: The regulations **do not apply** to land that is part of the airport itself at any given time (i.e., active airport land use).

> 📌 All boundaries are referenced to **Plan No. MT-0150 (A, B, C)**, dated November 6, 1967, which is on file with the Department of Transport in Ottawa.

#### **4. Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**

##### **General Prohibition (Section 5)**
No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object **on land subject to these regulations** if the **highest point** of such structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at the location of that point**:

1. **Horizontal Surface** (150 ft above ARP = 256 ft above sea level)  
2. **Approach Surfaces**:
   - For **Runway 06–24**:
     - 600 ft on each side of the centerline at the strip ends.
     - 2,000 ft on each side of the projected centerline at outer ends (200 ft above strip end elevations).
     - Extends **10,000 ft horizontally** from the strip ends.
   - For **Runway 15–33**:
     - 500 ft on each side at strip ends.
     - 1,100 ft on each side at outer ends (200 ft above strip end elevations).
     - Extends **8,000 ft horizontally** from the strip ends.
3. **Transitional Surfaces** (1:7 slope from strip edges to horizontal surface)

> ❌ Violation: Any structure exceeding these surfaces is prohibited.

##### **Exception (Permitted Structures)**
A building, structure, or addition **may exceed the horizontal surface** (i.e., go above 256 ft) **only if**:
- Its highest point is **no more than 30 feet above the land surface** at that location.
- This exception allows for minor structures (e.g., small towers, antennas, or landscaping features) to rise above the horizontal surface, as long as they remain within a 30-foot buffer above ground level.

> ⚠️ This exception is **not a blanket allowance**—it applies only where the structure’s height does not exceed the approach or transitional surfaces, and only if the elevation above ground is ≤30 ft.

---

#### **5. Prohibition of Interference with Aeronautical Operations**

No owner or lessee of land under these regulations may:
- Use or develop land in a way that **interferes with signals or communications** to or from aircraft.
- Interfere with **any aeronautical facilities** (e.g., radar, radio towers, navigation aids, emergency services).

> 🔍 This ensures uninterrupted air traffic control, flight safety, and communication.

---

#### **6. Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows to a height that exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, transitional, or horizontal), the **Minister** may issue a requirement for the **removal of the excess growth**.

> 🌳 This provision protects flight safety by preventing obstructions from trees or other vegetation near runways and approach paths.

---

#### **7. Specific Location Reference (Runway 06–24 Approach Surface Point)**

A specific point is defined for reference purposes:
- Located **600 feet northwesterly** from the centerline of Runway 06–24.
- Measured from a point **3,500 feet southeasterly** along the runway centerline from the **southwesterly end** of the runway.
- This point lies **1,716 feet in a straight line on a bearing S. 17°36′ E** from the intersection of:
  - **Southwesterly boundary of Forest Street**
  - **Southeasterly boundary of McConnell Street**
- There is a **concrete monument** at this point for surveying and enforcement.

> This reference point is critical for precise enforcement and measurement of approach surface boundaries.

#### **8. Runway Strip Dimensions**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **06–24** | 1,200 ft (600 ft on each side) | 6,600 ft |
| **15–33** | 1,000 ft (500 ft on each side) | 5,400 ft |

> These dimensions are based on **Plan MT-0150 (A, B, C)** and define the areas where approach and transitional surfaces begin.

### **Key Regulatory Objectives**

1. **Flight Safety**  
   Prevents obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases by limiting structure heights near runways and approach paths.

2. **Clearance Zones**  
   Establishes defined geometric surfaces (approach, transitional, horizontal) to provide safe visual and physical clearance for aircraft.

3. **Land Use Control**  
   Restricts development near the airport to prevent interference with air traffic operations and communication systems.

4. **Enforceable Boundaries**  
   Uses precise legal descriptions and reference points to ensure clarity and consistency in enforcement.

5. **Flexibility for Minor Developments**  
   Allows limited height above the horizontal surface (up to 30 ft) for small structures or natural features, balancing safety with local development needs.

### **Important Notes and Observations**

- **Revocation of Ministerial Authority**: The term "Minister" appears in the text but is **revoked by SOR/93-401, section 2**, indicating that current enforcement may be handled by a different authority (e.g., local municipality or Department of Transportation).
- **Reliance on Historic Plans**: All spatial definitions depend on **Plan MT-0150 (A, B, C)**, which may require periodic review or updating
