The regulation you provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), specifically in the context of species assessment and recognition under the authority of the federal government of Canada.

**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Reference:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutory Instrument 2002-29)  
**Title:** Order under the *Species at Risk Act* acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessments

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Issuing Authority:**  
   The regulation is issued by *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**. This means that the federal government, through its executive branch, formally recognizes and adopts decisions made by the scientific body responsible for assessing species at risk.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The regulation is grounded in **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**. This subsection requires the Minister of the Environment to receive and consider assessments made by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** regarding species that are at risk of extinction. Upon receipt of these assessments, the Minister is authorized to take further action, including designating species as “endangered,” “threatened,” or “special concern,” or to make other determinations under the Act.

3. **Content of the Regulation:**  
   The regulation acknowledges the **receipt of COSEWIC assessments** for a specific list of species — as detailed in the **annexed schedule**. This schedule identifies species that have been evaluated by COSEWIC and found to be at risk, based on scientific evidence regarding their population trends, habitat, threats, and overall conservation status.

4. **Purpose and Significance:**  
   - This order serves as an official government acknowledgment that the scientific evaluations of species by COSEWIC have been received and are now being considered under the legal framework of SARA.  
   - It is a procedural step that precedes any formal designation or listing of species under the Act.  
   - It ensures transparency and accountability by formally recognizing the role of COSEWIC, an independent scientific body, in the process of identifying species at risk.  
   - It marks the beginning of a formal federal response to species at risk, potentially leading to the development of recovery strategies, protection measures, or regulatory actions.

5. **Implications for Species at Risk:**  
   Once a species is formally assessed and recognized under SARA, the government may:  
   - Develop recovery plans  
   - Implement protective measures (e.g., habitat protection, restrictions on activities harmful to the species)  
   - Require federal or provincial authorities to take action to mitigate threats  
   - Provide funding or support for conservation efforts  

6. **Timeline and Context:**  
   This regulation was made in **2002** (S.C. 2002, c. 29), which reflects a period of increased federal focus on biodiversity conservation and the implementation of SARA. The COSEWIC assessments were conducted prior to this order, and the government’s formal acceptance of them ensures that the scientific findings are integrated into legal and policy frameworks.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a procedural and administrative step in the implementation of the *Species at Risk Act*. It formally recognizes the completion and submission of scientific assessments by COSEWIC for specific species, thereby initiating the federal government’s process of evaluating and responding to the conservation needs of those species. It underscores the partnership between science and policy in Canada’s efforts to protect biodiversity and prevent species extinction. The actual listing or designation of species under SARA may follow this order, depending on further review and decision-making by the Minister of the Environment.
