**Detailed Summary of the Boundary Bay Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1976-77, c. 28, sections 2 and 49)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Boundary Bay Airport Zoning Regulations* were approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. These regulations establish strict zoning and height limitations around **Boundary Bay Airport**, located in the municipality of Delta, British Columbia.

The regulations are designed to ensure **safety and operational efficiency** of the airport by controlling the height of structures, natural growth, and land use near the airport. They apply to all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport that fall within defined boundaries and elevation limits.

---

### **Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined within the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Boundary Bay Airport in Delta, BC |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurement. Located 385 metres northeast from a point 70 metres northwest along the centreline of Runway 12–30. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip. Designed to ensure aircraft have a clear path during landing and takeoff. Slope: 1 vertical metre to 50 horizontal metres (1:50 gradient). |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface extending above and around the airport, designed to protect aircraft from obstacles during all phases of flight. Described in Part IV of the schedule. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the runway designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction (e.g., Runway 12–30). Defined in Part V of the schedule. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces. Ensures a safe buffer zone between the runway and surrounding terrain. |

> **Assigned Elevation**: The airport reference point is set at **1.5 metres above sea level**.

---

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:

1. **All lands within** the designated airport boundaries.
2. **All lands directly under** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits.
3. **Public road allowances** adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport.

This includes both developed and undeveloped land within the defined perimeter.

---

### **Prohibited Activities – Height Restrictions**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** on land subject to these regulations if the **highest point** of that object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

- The **approach surface**
- The **outer surface**
- The **transitional surface**

This restriction applies to all new constructions and modifications to existing structures.

---

### **Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove or trim the excessive growth.

This provision ensures that natural features do not interfere with flight operations, particularly during approach and landing phases.

---

### **Prohibited Land Use – Waste and Bird Attraction**

No owner or occupier may:

- Use any land subject to these regulations for the **disposal or accumulation of waste, materials, or substances** that are:
  - **Edible by birds**, or
  - **Attractive to birds**

This restriction is critical to **prevent bird strikes**, which pose a significant hazard to aircraft safety.

---

### **Geographic Boundaries – Outer Limits of Regulated Land**

The outer limits of the regulated area are defined by a detailed, legally precise **boundary description** (a legal description in survey terms). The boundary is described as a sequence of directions and distances, starting and ending at a point on the westerly boundary of 80th Street.

Key features of the boundary:

- Begins at a point **450 metres north** of the intersection of 80th Street and the southerly boundary of Parcel D (Explanatory Plan 2515).
- Proceeds through several major streets and property lines:
  - 88th Street
  - 96th Street
  - Highway 499
  - District Lots 578, 580, 579, 581, 675, 699
  - 64th Street
  - 28th Avenue
  - Highway 17
  - 60B Street
  - Ladner Trunk Road
  - 48A Avenue
  - 49th Avenue
  - Brodie Road
  - 64th Street again
- Ends at a point **300 metres north** of the southwesterly corner of Parcel D, forming a closed loop.

> The full boundary is **shown in yellow** on **Department of Transport Plan No. B.C. 1266**, sheets 1 to 24, dated January 14, 1980.

### **Approach Surfaces – Description**

The approach surfaces are defined as **inclined planes** extending from each end of the runway strips associated with:

- Runway **07–25**
- Runway **07R–25L**
- Runway **12–30**

**Key Features:**

- Each approach surface has a **1:50 slope** (1 metre rise for every 50 metres of horizontal distance).
- The surface rises **until it intersects with the outer surface**.
- These surfaces are shown in **blue** on the same Department of Transport Plan (B.C. 1266).

> The purpose is to provide a clear, unobstructed zone for aircraft during final approach, preventing collisions with tall structures or terrain.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Flight Safety**: To prevent obstacles (buildings, trees, terrain) from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: To maintain consistent and predictable flight paths and reduce risk of accidents.
3. **Environmental Protection**: To minimize bird-related hazards by restricting food sources and waste accumulation.
4. **Zoning Clarity**: To define clearly which lands are subject to restrictions, ensuring compliance and enforcement.

---

### **Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Issue directions for removal of excessive vegetation.
  - Enforce compliance with height and land use restrictions.
- The regulations are enforceable through administrative action, and violations may result in penalties or legal proceedings.

---

### **Relevance and Context**

These regulations were enacted in **1976–1977**, during a period of increasing air traffic and infrastructure development in British Columbia. Boundary Bay Airport, while smaller than major international airports, serves regional and general aviation needs. The zoning rules reflect a balance between **airport safety**, **community development**, and **environmental stewardship**.

The use of **precise survey descriptions** and **standardized surface definitions** ensures consistency and legal enforceability.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Boundary Bay Airport Zoning Regulations* constitute a comprehensive and technically detailed framework for managing land use and development near a key regional airport. By defining:

- Clear spatial boundaries,
- Height limits based on approach, outer, and transitional surfaces,
- Restrictions on vegetation and waste,
- And specific enforcement mechanisms,

the regulations protect aviation safety and ensure that the airport operates in a secure, predictable, and environmentally responsible manner.

These rules remain in force as a foundational component of aviation safety policy in British Columbia and serve as a model for similar airport zoning regulations elsewhere.
