**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2021-948 and Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities as Minister for the National Housing Strategy Act

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **Section 3 of the National Housing Strategy Act (S.C. 2019, c. 29, s. 313)**. This section empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to amend, repeal, or designate individuals in relation to the administration of the National Housing Strategy Act.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2021-948 (October 26, 2021):**  
   The regulation formally **repeals** (i.e., cancels and removes from effect) the previously issued Order in Council P.C. 2021-948. This order, dated October 26, 2021, had likely established or modified certain administrative or procedural provisions related to the implementation of the National Housing Strategy Act. Its repeal indicates that the government has determined that the prior order is no longer necessary, outdated, or inconsistent with current policy or legislative intent.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities as Minister for the Act:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** as the designated Minister responsible for the purposes of the National Housing Strategy Act. This means that the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is now formally recognized as the principal minister accountable for overseeing and implementing the provisions of the Act.  
   
   - This designation is made under the authority of Section 3 of the National Housing Strategy Act, which allows for the assignment of ministerial responsibility in relation to the Act.
   - The Minister is also recognized as a **member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal designation of senior government office holders and confers certain ceremonial and administrative privileges.

**Purpose and Implications:**

- **Policy Continuity and Clarity:** By repealing the prior order, the government ensures that the current administrative framework for the National Housing Strategy is clear, up-to-date, and aligned with current government priorities.
- **Ministerial Accountability:** Assigning responsibility to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities signals that housing policy and strategy are now under the purview of a minister with expertise in infrastructure and community development, reinforcing the integration of housing within broader regional and urban planning efforts.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** The designation streamlines governance by clearly identifying who is responsible for policy development, implementation, and reporting related to the National Housing Strategy.

**Contextual Background:**

The National Housing Strategy Act was enacted in 2019 to establish a comprehensive, long-term framework for addressing housing affordability, supply, and access across Canada. The Act supports the development of a national strategy to improve housing outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations, and includes mechanisms for coordination among federal departments and agencies.

The repeal of P.C. 2021-948 suggests that the previous administrative arrangements were either superseded by new policy directions or were not effectively serving the strategic goals of the Act. The new designation ensures that the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is now the central point of contact and accountability for housing-related initiatives under the Act.

**Effective Date:**  
While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such regulatory actions typically take effect immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon the date of the Order in Council, unless otherwise specified.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a formal administrative update to the National Housing Strategy Act, removing an outdated directive and assigning clear ministerial responsibility to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. It strengthens the coherence and operational effectiveness of Canada’s national housing policy by aligning governance with current strategic and political priorities.
