### **Key Provisions and Summary:**

1. **Repeal of Prior Orders in Council:**
   - The regulation formally **repeals two previous Orders in Council** that established the structure, jurisdiction, or operational details of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (VRAB):
     - **P.C. 1985-1422**, dated April 25, 1985  
     - **P.C. 1987-1568**, dated July 30, 1987  
   - These Orders were likely foundational in defining the Board’s mandate, administrative framework, or geographical jurisdiction. Their repeal indicates a revision or modernization of the Board’s governance structure, suggesting that the earlier provisions were outdated, inconsistent, or superseded by new legislative intent.

2. **Designation of Head Office:**
   - The regulation **designates Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, as the head office** of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board.
   - This designation establishes Charlottetown as the central administrative and operational hub for the Board, which may include:
     - Housing the Board’s executive offices
     - Serving as the primary location for board meetings, hearings, and administrative functions
     - Acting as the central point for correspondence, record-keeping, and coordination with regional offices or Veterans Affairs Canada

3. **Legal Basis:**
   - The action is taken under **Section 12 of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act**, which grants the Governor General in Council (on ministerial recommendation) the authority to:
     - Amend, modify, or repeal provisions of the Act
     - Establish or reorganize the Board’s structure, including its location and operational framework
   - This provision allows for flexibility in administrative governance, particularly when aligning the Board’s operations with practical needs or geographic considerations.

4. **Effective Date and Implementation:**
   - While not explicitly stated in the text, such statutory instruments typically come into force upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon the date of the statutory citation (S.C. 1995, c. 18). The effective date would generally be the date of publication or the date specified in the instrument.
   - The repeal of the prior Orders in Council means that the provisions of P.C. 1985-1422 and P.C. 1987-1568 are no longer in force, and the new designation takes precedence.

5. **Policy and Practical Implications:**
   - **Centralization of Operations:** By designating Charlottetown as the head office, the government may be aiming to streamline administrative processes, improve access to veterans’ appeal services, or reduce operational costs.
   - **Geographic Representation:** Prince Edward Island, though geographically isolated, has a significant veteran population. Placing the head office there may improve accessibility and responsiveness for veterans in the region.
   - **Administrative Efficiency:** The move reflects a strategic decision to consolidate the Board’s operations under a single, accessible location, potentially enhancing coordination with Veterans Affairs Canada and improving service delivery.

6. **Historical Context:**
   - The 1985 and 1987 Orders likely established the Board’s early structure, possibly with a head office in a different location (e.g., Ottawa or another major city). The 1995 revision reflects a shift in administrative policy, possibly due to:
     - A need for regional representation
     - A desire to decentralize or improve access for regional veterans
     - Changes in the Board’s mandate or scope

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation marks a significant administrative update to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board. It formally removes outdated provisions from prior Orders in Council and establishes **Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, as the official head office** of the Board. This change enhances regional accessibility for veterans in Atlantic Canada and reflects a broader effort to align the Board’s operations with current needs and geographic realities. The action is legally sound, grounded in the authority granted by Section 12 of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act, and serves as a key step in modernizing the Board’s structure and service delivery.
