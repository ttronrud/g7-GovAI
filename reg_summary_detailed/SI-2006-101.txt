**1. Purpose and Context**  
This regulation implements a structural reorganization of the federal public service by transferring a specific office — the *Office of the Senior Advisor Responsible for Diversity and Special Projects* — from the **Privy Council Office (PCO)** to the **Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada (PSHRMA)**. The move reflects a broader effort to align public service functions with more specialized, human resources-focused governance, enhancing accountability and operational efficiency.

The transfer is grounded in the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, specifically **paragraph 2(a)a**, which authorizes the Governor in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign certain administrative and managerial responsibilities between federal departments and agencies, particularly those related to human resources, diversity, and public service management.

**3. Implications of the Transfer**

- **Functional Reassignment:**  
  The Office of the Senior Advisor, which previously operated under the Privy Council Office (a key policy and advisory body to the Prime Minister), is now placed under the authority of the PSHRMA. This agency is responsible for overseeing human resources policy, talent management, and workforce development across the federal public service.

- **Enhanced Focus on Diversity and Inclusion:**  
  The office’s mandate — particularly its responsibilities related to diversity and special projects — is now integrated into a centralized human resources framework. This supports a more strategic, data-driven, and institution-wide approach to promoting equity, inclusion, and workforce innovation.

- **Improved Oversight and Accountability:**  
  By placing diversity and special projects under the PSHRMA, the federal government strengthens accountability for human resources outcomes. The PSHRMA is better positioned to monitor compliance with diversity targets, assess the impact of inclusion initiatives, and ensure consistent implementation across all levels of the public service.

- **Strategic Alignment:**  
  The move aligns with federal government goals to modernize human resources practices and ensure that diversity and equity are embedded in public service operations, rather than being treated as isolated or ad hoc initiatives.

**4. Legal Authority**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)a of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which permits the transfer of functions, duties, or responsibilities between federal agencies and offices when such a transfer serves the public interest and improves administrative efficiency. The Governor in Council acts on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, indicating that the decision reflects high-level political and administrative consensus.

**5. Significance in Federal Public Service Reform**  
This regulation is a notable step in the evolution of the federal public service’s human resources architecture. It marks a shift from a policy-centric, executive-level structure (where the Privy Council Office traditionally holds advisory roles) to a more decentralized, human resources-focused governance model. It supports broader reforms aimed at creating a more inclusive, responsive, and effective public service.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation effectively reassigns the oversight of diversity and special projects within the federal public service from the Privy Council Office to the Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada, effective August 1, 2006. The transfer strengthens the federal government’s capacity to manage workforce diversity strategically, improves accountability, and reflects a commitment to building a more equitable and inclusive public service. It is a key component of ongoing efforts to modernize and professionalize federal human resources management.
