The regulation you have provided is a **statutory transfer of powers, duties, and functions** within the Canadian federal government, specifically involving the **Minister of State (Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance)** and the **Minister of State (Tourism)**, under the authority of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation:

---

### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under:
- **Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**  
  This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the power to transfer powers, duties, and functions between ministers within the federal government, particularly in the context of administrative restructuring or reallocation of responsibilities.

---

### **2. Subject Matter of the Transfer**
The regulation transfers:
- The **powers, duties, and functions** of the **Minister of State (Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance)**  
  Specifically, those powers, duties, and functions that were previously assigned to that minister **under the Canadian Tourism Commission Act**.

---

### **3. Historical Context: Prior Transfer**
The powers, duties, and functions in question were originally transferred from the **Minister of State (Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance)** to the **Minister of State (Tourism)** via:
- **Order in Council P.C. 2021-945**, dated **October 26, 2021**  
  This earlier order established the initial transfer of tourism-related responsibilities from the dual-role minister (who also held finance responsibilities) to the dedicated tourism minister.

> This means that the current regulation is a **subsequent administrative confirmation or reconfirmation** of that transfer — not a new assignment, but a formal legal update reinforcing the reallocation.

---

### **4. Scope of the Transfer**
The transfer applies **only to the powers, duties, and functions** of the Minister of State (Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance) **as they relate to the Canadian Tourism Commission Act**.  
This includes:
- Oversight of the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC)
- Policy development and strategic direction related to tourism promotion
- Budgetary and financial oversight (as previously shared)
- Regulatory or administrative responsibilities under the Act

**Important Note**: The transfer **does not** include the financial responsibilities previously held by the minister as "Associate Minister of Finance" — those responsibilities are not part of the scope of this transfer. The regulation focuses solely on the tourism-related functions under the Canadian Tourism Commission Act.

---

### **5. Legal Basis and Citation**
The regulation is cited under:
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** – This refers to a section of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003*, Chapter 22, which likely provides the enabling authority for ministerial transfers under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
- **R.S., c. P-34** – The *Regulations of the Public Service*, Chapter P-34, which may contain procedural or administrative rules governing ministerial duties and transfers.
- **S.C. 2000, c. 28** – Possibly the original enabling legislation or a foundational statute (e.g., the Public Service Act or related legislation).
- **SI/2021-90** – A Statutory Instrument (SI) issued in 2021, likely the original Order in Council that initiated the transfer of duties (though this may be a reference to a supporting or related instrument).

> These citations reflect the **legal framework and procedural history** of the transfer.

### **6. Purpose and Implications**
The purpose of this regulation is to:
- **Clarify and formalize** the reallocation of tourism responsibilities to the Minister of State (Tourism) after the earlier 2021 transfer.
- Ensure **continuity and accountability** in the governance of tourism policy and promotion.
- Reflect a **restructuring of ministerial portfolios** to improve focus and efficiency — aligning the tourism portfolio with a dedicated minister, removing financial responsibilities that may have been a source of overlap or confusion.

This move supports a more **specialized and effective approach** to tourism policy, allowing the Minister of State (Tourism) to concentrate on tourism strategy, marketing, and development without the added burden of financial oversight.
