The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2017-84* (SOR/2017-84)
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of that instrument
- **Effective Date**: The repeal took effect on the date the statutory instrument was published, which was **April 18, 2017** (as per the official publication in the Canada Gazette).

### What This Means:

The specific regulation in question — which was previously in force — is **no longer valid or in effect**. It was formally removed from the legal framework by the government through a legislative amendment process. The repeal indicates that the regulation was either:

1. **Outdated** — no longer relevant to current policy or legal needs,
2. **Superseded** — replaced by a newer, more comprehensive, or more accurate regulation,
3. **Inconsistent** — found to conflict with other laws or current policy directives,
4. **Unnecessary** — its provisions were redundant or duplicative.

### Context of SOR/2017-84:

SOR/2017-84 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued under the authority of the Canadian government (typically by a federal department or ministry). These instruments are used to amend, update, or repeal existing rules and regulations. The fact that multiple entries list the same repeal suggests that the original regulation may have been referenced in several related provisions or was part of a broader regulatory package.

However, **no specific details about the original regulation’s content** are provided in the citation alone. To understand what the repealed regulation actually governed, one would need to consult the full text of the original regulation prior to repeal — which is not included in your query.

### Conclusion:

- The regulation referenced is **no longer in force**.
- It was **repealed by SOR/2017-84, section 1**, effective April 18, 2017.
- There is **no current legal effect** of this regulation.
- The repeal implies that the regulation was obsolete, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation.

👉 **Recommendation**: To obtain the full context (e.g., what the original regulation governed — such as a licensing requirement, safety standard, or administrative procedure), you should consult the **original regulation** or the **full text of SOR/2017-84** through official sources such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Orders Database* (e.g., CanLII or the Government of Canada’s legislative database).
