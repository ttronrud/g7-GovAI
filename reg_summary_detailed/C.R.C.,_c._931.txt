### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status**:  
The regulation is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed under **SOR/2011-17, section 44**.

**Repeal Date**:  
The repeal took effect on or around May 17, 2011, as that is the date of publication of the statutory order (SOR/2011-17).

**Legal Context**:  
- SOR (Statutory Orders and Regulations) are instruments used by Canadian provinces to implement or amend legislation.  
- In this case, the regulation was likely a provincial regulation (likely under a statute such as the *Regulations respecting the operation of certain vehicles*, *Motor Vehicle Act*, or a related field), and its repeal means that the specific rules it established are no longer applicable or enforceable.

**Reason for Repeal**:  
While the exact reason for repeal is not specified in the provided text, common reasons include:
- Obsolescence (the regulation no longer serves a current purpose),
- Consolidation of rules into a more comprehensive or updated regulation,
- Legislative review or modernization of the regulatory framework,
- Inconsistency with current laws or policies.

**Impact**:  
Any legal obligations, duties, or prohibitions previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**. Entities (e.g., individuals, businesses, government bodies) must refer to current regulations for compliance.

**Note on Repetition**:  
The repeated entries (over 25 times) are likely a formatting or data-entry error and do not indicate multiple regulations or versions. All references point to the **same repealed regulation**.
