**Detailed Summary of the Tang.ɢwan — ḥačxʷiqak — Tsigis Marine Protected Area Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
These regulations are made under **subsection 35(3)a of the Oceans Act**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**. The purpose is to designate and regulate the **Tang.ɢwan — ḥačxʷiqak — Tsigis Marine Protected Area (MPA)** — a marine conservation zone established to protect marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecological integrity, particularly in areas of scientific and cultural significance.

The regulations come into force on the day of registration and are part of Canada’s broader framework for marine conservation under the Oceans Act.

---

### **2. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Marine Protected Area (MPA):**  
  Refers to the specific area of sea designated under **section 2** of these regulations. It includes:
  - The **seabed**
  - The **subsoil to a depth of 1,000 meters**
  - The **water column above the seabed**

This definition ensures comprehensive protection across all layers of the marine environment.

---

### **3. Geographical Boundaries of the MPA**
The MPA is defined by a series of **rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing) and boundary transitions, as follows:

1. **From Point 1 to Point 2:**  
   A rhumb line from point 1 to point 2, where point 2 lies on the **western boundary of the Scott Islands Protected Marine Area** (as defined in Schedule 1 to its Establishment Order).

2. **From Point 2 to Point 3:**  
   A southerly rhumb line following the **western boundary of the Scott Islands MPA** to point 3.

3. **From Point 3 to Point 4:**  
   A southeasterly rhumb line along the boundary of the Scott Islands MPA to point 4.

4. **From Point 4 to Point 6:**  
   A series of rhumb lines connecting point 4 to point 5 and then to point 6.

5. **From Point 6 to Point 7 to the International Boundary:**  
   A rhumb line from point 6 to point 7, intersecting the **international boundary between Canada and the United States**.

6. **From Point 8 to Point 1:**  
   A southwesterly line along the **international boundary** to point 8 — which marks the **seaward limit of Canada’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ)**.

7. **Back to Point 1:**  
   A northwesterly line along the **seaward limit of the EEZ** to a point that intersects a rhumb line from point 1 to point 9, then back to point 1.

> All coordinates are expressed in the **North American Datum 1983 (NAD83), Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS)**, ensuring consistency with national mapping standards.

### **4. Management Zones Within the MPA**
The MPA is divided into three distinct **management zones**, each with different levels of permitted activity:

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Dellwood Zone** | Bounded by rhumb lines from points 10 to 13 and back to 10. Includes seabed, subsoil to 1,000 m, and water column. |
| **Union Zone** | Bounded by rhumb lines from points 14 to 17 and back to 14. Includes seabed, subsoil to 1,000 m, and water column. |
| **General Zone** | The remainder of the MPA not included in the Dellwood or Union Zones. |

> These zones allow for **tiered management**, enabling more flexible use of certain areas while protecting sensitive zones.

---

### **5. Prohibited Activities**
It is **prohibited** to carry out any activity that:
- Disturbs, damages, destroys, or removes any **living marine organism** or **part of its habitat**  
- Is **likely to do so**

This includes activities such as bottom trawling, dredging, or anchoring that could harm benthic ecosystems.

---

### **6. Permitted Activities (with Conditions)**
Despite the general prohibition, the following activities are **allowed**, provided they comply with relevant legislation and regulations:

#### **Fishing Activities:**
- **Non-commercial fishing** authorized under **Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations**, using gear that **does not contact the seabed** (e.g., surface or midwater gear).
- **Commercial or recreational fishing** in the **General Zone**:
  - Using **pelagic hook and line** or **midwater trawls** at a depth **not exceeding 500 meters**.
- **Commercial or recreational fishing** in the **Dellwood or Union Zones**:
  - Using **pelagic hook and line** at a depth **not exceeding 100 meters**.

> These restrictions protect sensitive seabed habitats and hydrothermal vent ecosystems.

#### **Other Permitted Activities:**
- **Laying, maintenance, or repair of cables**
- **Navigation of vessels**
- **Public safety, national defence, national security, law enforcement, or emergency response activities**
- **Activities included in an approved activity plan** submitted to and approved by the Minister

---

### **7. Scientific and Educational Activity Requirements**
Any individual or organization proposing to carry out **scientific research or educational activities** in the MPA must submit a **detailed activity plan** to the Minister. The plan must include:

1. **Contact information** of the applicant and, if applicable, the responsible individual (title, address, phone, email).
2. **Vessel details**:
   - Name, registration, call sign, owner, master, and operator.
3. **Activity description**:
   - Purpose, methods, and data to be collected.
4. **Location**:
   - Geographical coordinates and a map showing the activity’s location within the MPA.
5. **Dates**:
   - Proposed dates and alternative dates.
6. **Equipment**:
   - List of equipment, deployment/retrieval methods, anchoring/mooring procedures.
7. **Sampling**:
   - Types and quantities of samples to be collected.
8. **Substances**:
   - Any substances to be deposited (excluding those authorized under the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001* for navigation).
9. **Environmental impacts**:
   - Description of likely adverse effects and mitigation measures.
10. **Past or anticipated research**:
   - History of prior work in the MPA.
11. **Expected outcomes**:
   - Description of any resulting study, report, or publication and its anticipated completion date.

### **8. Minister’s Approval Criteria**
The Minister may approve the activity plan **only if**:

- It will **increase public awareness** of the MPA.

#### Additional Approval Requirement:
- Approval is **required** to be consistent with:

  - **Customary international law**

---

### **9. Conditions for Denial of Approval**
The Minister **must not approve** an activity plan if:

1. The scientific research or monitoring activity is **likely to adversely affect**:
   - The **Salty Dawg hydrothermal vent** (defined by rhumb lines from points A to D and back to A)
   - The **High Rise hydrothermal vent** (defined by rhumb lines from points E to H and back to E)

2. Any substance deposited during the activity is a **deleterious substance** under **subsection 34(1) of the Fisheries Act**, **unless authorized** under **subsection 36(4)** of that Act.

3. The **cumulative environmental effects** (including past and current activities) are such that the activity is likely to:
   - Destroy habitat of living marine organisms
   - Adversely affect biological, chemical, or oceanographic processes that maintain or enhance biodiversity, habitat structure, or ecosystem function.

> This reflects a precautionary approach to protect highly sensitive deep-sea ecosystems.
