**Detailed Summary of the Complaint Information (Foreign Insurance Companies) Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The *Complaint Information (Foreign Insurance Companies) Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **section 1021a of the Insurance Companies Act (ICA)**. This regulatory instrument was enacted to ensure that Canadian consumers are provided with clear, accessible, and timely information regarding how to file complaints against foreign insurance companies operating in Canada.

The regulation is referenced in **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465** and **S.C. 1991, c. 47**, indicating its legal foundation and historical context within the Canadian insurance regulatory framework.

---

**Purpose and Scope:**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish the prescribed information and procedures** that foreign insurance companies must provide to Canadian consumers in order to facilitate complaints. Specifically, the regulations apply under **subsections 604(4)** and **605(1)** of the *Insurance Companies Act*.

These provisions require that:

- Foreign insurance companies operating in Canada must inform consumers of the **proper channel(s)** through which they can file a complaint.
- The information must be clearly and prominently provided in a manner that ensures consumer accessibility and understanding.

---

**Prescribed Complaint Information:**

The regulation specifies that the **prescribed information** includes the following:

1. **Contact Details of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC)**  
   Consumers may contact the FCAC at:
   - **Office Address**: 427 Laurier Avenue West, 6th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1R 1B9  
   - **Website**: www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca  

This ensures that consumers have a clear, official, and accessible point of contact for resolving disputes with foreign insurance companies.

**Manner of Providing the Information:**

The prescribed manner of providing the complaint information is one of two options:

1. **In a Brochure, Statement of Account, or Written Statement**  
   The information must be included in one of the following:
   - A **brochure** provided to the consumer
   - A **statement of account**
   - A **written statement** that contains other required disclosures under the *Insurance Companies Act*

   These disclosures must include **all information required by law** under the Act in relation to:
   - An arrangement referred to in **subsection 601(4)** of the ICA (which typically covers insurance arrangements involving credit, payment, or borrowing)
   - A **payment, credit, or charge card**
   - The **cost of borrowing**
   - Any other **consumer obligation** imposed by a foreign insurance company under a consumer protection provision

   This ensures that the complaint information is not provided in isolation but is part of a broader, transparent disclosure package that informs consumers about their rights and responsibilities.

2. **In a Separate Document**  
   Alternatively, the complaint information may be provided in a **standalone, separate document**. This option allows for greater clarity and ease of access, particularly if the consumer is seeking to file a complaint independently of other financial disclosures.

**Key Regulatory Implications:**

- **Consumer Protection**: The regulation strengthens consumer rights by ensuring that individuals dealing with foreign insurance companies are aware of how to file complaints and where to direct them.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: By requiring foreign insurers to provide clear complaint procedures, the regulation promotes transparency and holds foreign companies accountable for their conduct in the Canadian market.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: The requirement to include complaint information in required disclosures aligns with broader consumer protection objectives under the *Insurance Companies Act*, particularly in relation to fair treatment, access to redress, and informed decision-making.
- **Enforcement and Oversight**: The FCAC serves as the designated regulatory body for handling consumer complaints against foreign insurers, providing a centralized and authoritative mechanism for dispute resolution.

---

**Repeal Note:**

It is important to note that **this regulation was repealed by SOR/2009-62, section 1**. This means that the current version of the *Complaint Information (Foreign Insurance Companies) Regulations* is **no longer in force** as of the date of the repeal.

The repeal suggests that:
- The regulatory framework for handling complaints from foreign insurance companies has been updated or replaced by more modern or comprehensive legislation.
- The original provisions may have been deemed outdated or superseded by new consumer protection or insurance regulations.

---

**Conclusion:**

While the *Complaint Information (Foreign Insurance Companies) Regulations* were historically significant in establishing a clear pathway for consumer complaints against foreign insurers, they are now **repealed**. The original intent—to ensure Canadian consumers have accessible and accurate information on how to file complaints—has likely been addressed through updated regulations, possibly under the broader *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC)* framework or other consumer protection statutes.

Therefore, although the regulation provides a detailed and well-structured model for consumer complaint procedures, it is **no longer applicable** in current Canadian regulatory practice.

**Recommendation for Users:**

When dealing with foreign insurance companies, consumers should refer to the **current FCAC website (www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca)** for up-to-date complaint procedures, disclosure requirements, and consumer protections, as the repealed regulation no longer governs the matter.
