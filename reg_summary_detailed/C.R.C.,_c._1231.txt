**Detailed Summary of the *Navigable Waters Bridges Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are formally known as the *Navigable Waters Bridges Regulations* and may be cited accordingly. They establish rules governing the construction, operation, and navigation-related aspects of bridges that cross navigable waters in Canada.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Bridge**: Includes not only completed bridges but also bridges that are under construction. This broad definition ensures that regulatory requirements apply throughout the entire lifecycle of a bridge project.
- **Minister**: Refers to the Minister of Transport, who has authority over the implementation and enforcement of these regulations.
- **Movable Span**: Encompasses various types of bridge spans that can be moved to allow passage for vessels. This includes:
  - Lift spans (e.g., vertical lifting)
  - Draw spans (e.g., horizontal movement)
  - Swing spans (e.g., rotating)
  - Jackknife spans (e.g., articulated, folding movements)

These definitions ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in applying the rules to different types of movable structures.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
- These regulations apply to **every bridge over a navigable water** that is constructed **after November 17, 1923**.
- The term *navigable water* refers to waters used for transportation, such as rivers, lakes, and certain canals or harbors where commercial or public navigation occurs.

> **Exception**: The regulations **do not apply** to bridges over:
> - Canals
> - Waters of any public harbor  
> **if** such exclusion conflicts with other regulations made or approved by the Governor in Council (i.e., federal or provincial legislation governing canals or harbors).

This provision allows for flexibility in areas governed by specialized rules, such as those related to inland waterways or port operations.

---

### **4. Lights and Markings for Navigation**
- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Prescribe **lights** and **markings** (e.g., buoys, beacons) to be displayed on bridges or on movable spans.
  - Specify the **times** during which these lights must be exhibited.
- The **owner of the bridge** is legally required to:
  - Install
  - Maintain
  - Operate
  - Ensure visibility of all prescribed lights and navigational aids.

This ensures safe passage for vessels by providing clear visual signals indicating bridge presence, movable span status, or navigable routes.

---

### **5. Integration with Other Acts**
- If a bridge design is required under either:
  - The *Canadian Navigable Waters Act*
  - The *Railway Act*
  to be submitted to the Minister for approval,  
  the submitted **plan and description** must clearly indicate:
  - Any lights or markings prescribed by the Minister under these regulations.

This ensures consistency and compliance across multiple regulatory frameworks.

---

### **6. Approval of Passages for Navigation (Multi-Span Bridges)**
- For bridges consisting of **more than one span**, the Minister may determine which **specific span(s)** allow passage for navigation.
- This allows for flexibility in managing complex bridge systems where only certain spans are navigable due to structural or operational constraints.

> Note: A section of these regulations was **revoked** by *SOR/86-970, section 2*, indicating that some outdated provisions were removed. The current text reflects only the active, relevant parts.

---

### **7. Personnel Requirements for Movable Spans**
- Unless otherwise approved by the Minister, the **owner of a movable span bridge** must:
  - Maintain a **responsible person on duty at all times**.
  - This person must be **trained and qualified** to operate the movable span safely and efficiently.

This ensures that there is always a qualified individual available to manage the movement of the span in response to vessel traffic or emergencies.

---

### **8. Navigation Rules for Vessels with Two Approved Passages**
- When a bridge has **two approved passages** for navigation (e.g., one on the left, one on the right), a vessel must:
  - Use the **passage on its starboard (right) side**.
- This rule follows international maritime conventions (like the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea) to promote safe and predictable vessel behavior.

---

### **9. Special Provisions for More Than Two Passages**
- If a bridge has **more than two passages** approved for navigation, the Minister may issue **special provisions** to govern how vessels navigate through or under the structure.
- These provisions can include:
  - Priority rules
  - Time-based access
  - Specific signaling procedures
  - Traffic management plans

This allows for tailored solutions in complex or high-traffic environments.

---

### **10. Signal to Request Opening of a Movable Span**
- A vessel approaching a movable span bridge must give a **three-long blast** of whistle or horn to request that the span be opened.
- This standardized signal ensures clear communication between vessels and bridge operators.

---

### **11. Response to the Opening Request**
- Upon receiving the three-long blast signal, the **responsible person in charge of the movable span** must:
  - Open the span **immediately**, or
  - As soon as reasonably possible, to allow vessel passage.

This ensures prompt and safe response to vessel requests, minimizing delays and risks.

---

### **12. Exceptions to Span Opening**
- The Minister may **prohibit the opening** of a movable span during specific periods (e.g., maintenance, holidays, or extreme weather).
- During such periods, the responsible person **must not open the span** unless otherwise authorized by the Minister.
- This provides operational flexibility and safety during non-operational times.

---

### **13. Safety Requirement for Vessel Entry**
- A vessel **shall not enter** a passage through or under a movable span **until the span is fully open**.
- **Exception**: A vessel may proceed under a closed span **only if it can safely do so** without risk to crew, vessel, or environment.

This rule prioritizes safety by preventing vessels from entering a potentially hazardous situation due to an unopened span.

---

### **Summary of Key Objectives**
These regulations aim to:
- Ensure **safe navigation** of vessels through or under bridges.
- Provide **clear, standardized procedures** for communication and operation of movable spans.
- Promote **coordination between bridge operators and vessel crews**.
- Maintain **public safety and environmental protection** by preventing collisions and ensuring predictable traffic flow.

---

### **Important Notes**
- These regulations are **historical in nature**, dating back to 1923, and reflect early federal efforts to regulate infrastructure in navigable waters.
- While still referenced in some legal frameworks, many of the original provisions have been updated or superseded by modern transportation and maritime safety laws (e.g., the *Maritime Safety Act*, *Canada Shipping Act*, or *Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations*).
- The revocation of one section (SOR/86-970, s. 2) indicates that the regulations are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect current needs and technological advances.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Navigable Waters Bridges Regulations* form a foundational legal framework for managing the interaction between maritime traffic and movable bridges in Canada. By defining responsibilities, setting operational standards, and establishing clear communication protocols, they enhance safety, efficiency, and predictability in waterway navigation. Although largely historical, they remain relevant in understanding the evolution of bridge and navigation regulation in Canada. Modern applications would likely integrate with updated digital monitoring systems, automated signaling, and real-time traffic management technologies.
