**Detailed Summary of the Review Panel Regulations under the Pest Control Products Act (S.C. 2002, c. 28)**

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Health under **subsection 67(1) of the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA)**, establish the framework for the creation, operation, and conduct of **review panels** when a decision on a pest control product is challenged. The purpose is to ensure that decisions related to the health and environmental risks of pest control products are subject to independent, scientifically grounded review—particularly when there are legitimate concerns about the validity of the scientific evaluations used in those decisions.

The regulations provide detailed procedural, substantive, and ethical guidelines governing the composition, functions, and conduct of review panels, with a strong emphasis on **scientific integrity**, **transparency**, and **conflict of interest management**.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Pest Control Products Act* (PCPA), which governs the regulation of pest control products in Canada. |
| **Objector** | A person who formally objects to a regulatory decision (e.g., approval or refusal of a pest control product) and files a notice of objection under **section 35** of the PCPA. |
| **Participant** | Includes both objectors and individuals who make representations under **subsection 35(7)** of the Act during a review panel hearing. |
| **Terms of Reference** | The specific scope and subject matter of the review panel’s inquiry, determined under **subsection 35(6)** of the Act. |

---

### **Requirements for a Notice of Objection**

For a notice of objection to be valid and trigger a potential review panel, it must include the following elements:

1. **Identity of the Objector**  
   - Full name and address of the individual or corporation.  
   - If a corporation, its corporate name and any alternate registered names used in a province.

2. **Decision in Question**  
   - The specific decision (e.g., approval, refusal, or modification) being challenged.  
   - The date on which the decision was made.

3. **Scientific Basis of Objection**  
   - A clear explanation of why the objector believes the scientific evaluations used in the decision are flawed or insufficient.  
   - This includes concerns about the assessment of **health risks**, **environmental risks**, or the **value** (i.e., efficacy, safety, and benefit-to-risk ratio) of the pest control product.

4. **Supporting Evidence**  
   - Scientific reports, test data, or other evidence that substantiates the objection.  
   - Evidence must be relevant, credible, and directly tied to the scientific basis of the objection.

> *Note:* This requirement ensures that objections are not speculative or based on personal opinion but are grounded in verifiable scientific data.

### **When Is a Review Panel Established?**

The Minister of Health has discretion to determine whether a review panel should be established. The decision is based on two key criteria:

1. **Scientifically Founded Doubt**  
   - The information in the notice of objection must raise **scientifically valid and reasonable doubt** about the validity of the health, environmental, or value assessments that underpinned the regulatory decision.

2. **Need for Expert Scientific Advice**  
   - The Minister must assess whether **expert scientific input** would assist in resolving the matter.  
   - This ensures that the review is only conducted when it is genuinely necessary to evaluate scientific complexity or uncertainty.

> *Implication:* The establishment of a review panel is not automatic. It requires a threshold of scientific merit and a demonstrated need for expert evaluation.

---

### **Qualifications for Review Panel Members**

Each member of the review panel must meet strict criteria to ensure impartiality, expertise, and independence:

1. **Scientific Competence**  
   - Must possess sufficient scientific knowledge to evaluate the health, environmental, and value-related aspects of the pest control product in question.

2. **No Recent Government Employment**  
   - Must not have worked in any of the following within the **one year prior to appointment**:
     - A federal department, division, or branch (Schedule I or I.1 to the *Financial Administration Act*).
     - A corporation (Schedule II).
     - A parent Crown corporation (Schedule III).

   > *Purpose:* Prevents conflicts of interest arising from prior government or corporate ties.

3. **Conflict of Interest Disclosure**  
   - Must provide a **written statement** confirming they have **no actual or potential conflict of interest** related to the decision under review.

4. **Obligation to Disclose Conflicts**  
   - Must sign a written commitment to **immediately disclose** any actual or potential conflict of interest that may arise during their service on the panel.

> *This dual requirement (pre-disclosure and ongoing disclosure) strengthens transparency and accountability.*

### **Structure and Leadership of the Review Panel**

- **Single-Member Panel**: The sole member serves as the **chairperson**.
- **Multi-Member Panel**: The Minister designates one member as the **chairperson**.

#### **Duties of the Chairperson**

- Presides over all review panel hearings.
- Directs and manages the panel’s activities within the **terms of reference**.
- Ensures the hearing proceeds in accordance with procedures established under **subsection 35(6)** of the PCPA.

#### **Alternate Chairperson**

- The Minister may designate **another panel member** to act in place of the chairperson if:

### **Removal of Panel Members**

A member may be removed under the following circumstances:

1. **Request by the Member**  
   - The member may voluntarily request removal.

2. **Failure to Meet Qualification Criteria**  
   - If the member fails to satisfy the requirements outlined in **section 4** (scientific knowledge, employment history, conflict of interest).

3. **Refusal or Inability to Perform Duties**  
   - If the member refuses or is unable to carry out their responsibilities within a reasonable time.

4. **Reasonable Grounds for Impairing Objectivity**  
   - If there are reasonable grounds to believe that the member’s presence undermines the objectivity or integrity of the panel.

5. **New Employment in a Prohibited Entity**  
   - If the member is subsequently employed in a federal department, division, corporation, or parent Crown corporation as defined in the *Financial Administration Act* schedules.

> *Note:* Removal is a safeguard to preserve the impartiality and credibility of the review process.

### **Confidentiality and Security Measures**

To protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of the review process, the following rules apply:

- **Restricted Access to Information**  
  - Only **participants** (objectors or those making representations under section 35(7)) are permitted to attend hearings where **certain information is being discussed**.
  - This information is:
    - Not accessible to the public under **subsection 42(4)** of the PCPA.
    - Not inspectable under **section 43** of the PCPA.

- **Affidavit or Statutory Declaration Requirement**  
  - Each participant must submit a sworn affidavit or statutory declaration (under the *Canada Evidence Act*) stating that they undertake to:
    1. **Not disclose** the confidential information to any third party.
    2. **Not use** the information for any purpose other than participation in the hearing.

> *This protects the confidentiality of scientific data and prevents misuse or public disclosure of potentially sensitive findings.*

### **Conclusion**

The Review Panel Regulations provide a **robust, transparent, and scientifically sound framework** for challenging decisions on pest control products. They empower the Minister to establish independent review panels only when scientifically justified and when expert input is needed. By enforcing strict qualifications, confidentiality rules, and conflict-of-interest safeguards, these regulations enhance public trust in the regulatory process while protecting the integrity of scientific assessments.

These rules represent a critical component of Canada’s regulatory system for ensuring that pest control product approvals are not only legally valid but also scientifically defensible and
