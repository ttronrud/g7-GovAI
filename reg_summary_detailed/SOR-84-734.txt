### **Detailed Summary of the Dryden Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Dryden Airport Zoning Regulations**, officially adopted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**, establish specific zoning and spatial restrictions to ensure the safe operation of aircraft at **Dryden Airport** in the District of Kenora, Ontario. These regulations are designed to prevent obstacles that could interfere with aircraft takeoff, landing, and approach paths by limiting the elevation of structures, natural features, and waste disposal activities near the airport.

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Dryden Airport, located in the District of Kenora, Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a datum for elevation and spatial measurements. Located 80.08 m north of the centerline of Runway 11–29, measured westward 735.13 m from the eastern end of the runway. |
| **Strip** | The primary landing area (runway and adjacent taxiway) designated for aircraft movement in a specific direction. Includes runway and approach zones. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a strip. Designed to ensure clear visibility and safe approach paths for aircraft. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of a strip and its approach surfaces, connecting to the outer surface or another transitional surface. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the airport reference point’s elevation (412.0 m ASL), but capped at 9 meters above ground level in areas where the elevation is less than 9 m. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: 412.0 meters above sea level.

## **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Dryden Airport, including public road allowances, as defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.

This includes:
- Land within the **outer limits** of the airport boundary.
- Areas surrounding runways, taxiways, and approach paths.
- Zones where construction or natural growth could affect flight safety.

---

## **4. Prohibitions on Construction and Obstruction**

### **(a) Height Restrictions**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object.
- Build any addition to an existing structure.

**The highest point of any such object must not exceed**:
1. The **approach surface** of any strip,
2. The **outer surface**, or
3. The **transitional surface**.

> These surfaces are defined geometrically and serve as safety boundaries to prevent obstructions during aircraft approaches and landings.

### **(b) Natural Growth Management**
If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces:
- The **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to remove the excessive growth.

> This provision ensures that even natural features do not pose a hazard to aircraft operations.

### **(c) Waste Disposal Prohibition**
No owner or occupier may:
- Use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - Edible by birds, or
  - Attractive to birds.

> This rule is critical to prevent bird strikes, which are a major aviation hazard.

## **5. Geographical Boundaries and Key Features**

### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located **80.08 m north** of the centerline of Runway 11–29.
- Measured **735.13 m westward** from the eastern end of Runway 11–29.
- Serves as the origin point for all elevation and spatial calculations.

### **B. Outer Boundary of the Airport (Zoning Plan No. 60-090-82-45, Sheets 1–14, July 26, 1983)**

The boundary is a complex, precisely defined polygon described in a series of directional lines and coordinates. Key elements include:
- Begins at the **northwesterly corner of Lot 23, Concession 10, Township of Zealand**.
- Traverses through several concessions and townships:
  - Across Lots 23, 22, 21 (Concessions 10–11)
  - Crosses Pronger Lake (easterly and southerly)
  - Reaches the **northeasterly corner of Lot 15, Concession 11** (boundary between Zealand and Brownridge)
  - Continues south along township boundaries
  - Extends into Township of Brownridge via azimuths (90° and 00°)
  - Follows the **northeastern limit of approach surface (29)** and intersects it at specific coordinates
  - Traverses the **southwesterly limit of approach surface (11)** and connects back to the starting point

> This boundary defines the **legal jurisdiction** of the zoning regulations and establishes where the restrictions apply.

## **6. Approach Surfaces (Runway End Zones)**

Approach surfaces are **inclined planes** designed to ensure aircraft have unobstructed visibility during approach. Each is tailored to the runway and approach direction.

| Runway Approach | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Runway 11 (approach 11)** | Inclined plane with **1:50 slope** (1 m rise per 50 m run) rising to a horizontal line **15,000 m** from the end of the strip. Outer ends are **2,400 m** from the centerline. The horizontal line is **300 m above** the elevation at the runway end. |
| **Runway 29 (approach 29)** | Same as approach 11: **1:50 slope**, 15,000 m distance, 2,400 m lateral offset, **300 m above** runway end elevation. |
| **Runway 05 (approach 05)** | Steeper slope: **1:20** (1 m rise per 20 m run), rising to a horizontal line **2,000 m** from the end. Outer ends are **230 m** from centerline. The horizontal line is **100 m above** runway end elevation. |
| **Runway 23 (approach 23)** | Same as approach 05: **1:20 slope**, 2,000 m distance, 230 m lateral offset, **100 m above** runway end elevation. |

> The steeper slope for Runways 05 and 23 reflects their shorter approach distances and tighter approach corridors.

---

## **7. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 412.0 m + 45 m = **457.0 m ASL**).
- **Exception**: Where the ground elevation is less than 9 meters, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level** to avoid creating artificial elevation thresholds in low-lying areas.
- Acts as a **topographical cap** for all structures and vegetation within the airport zone.

---

## **8. Strips (Runway Areas)**

Defined in **Sheet 6** of the zoning plan (July 26, 1983):

| Runway | Width | Length | Lateral Coverage |
|--------|-------|--------|------------------|
| **11–29** | 300 m | 1,889 m | 150 m on each side of centerline |
| **05–23** | 60 m | 670 m | 30 m on each side of centerline |

> The **11–29 strip** is significantly larger and longer, indicating it is the primary runway for operations.

---

## **9. Transitional Surfaces**

These surfaces extend from the **lateral edges of the strips** and their approach surfaces, rising at specific slopes to connect to the outer surface or adjacent transitional surfaces.

| Runway | Slope | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **11–29** | 1:7 (1 m rise per 7 m run) | Rises from lateral limits of strip and approach surfaces to intersect with outer surface or adjacent transitional surface. |
| **05–23** | 1:5 (1 m rise per 5 m run) | Steeper slope due to shorter approach distance; rises to outer surface or adjacent surface. |

> Transitional surfaces ensure a smooth, safe gradient between the runway edge and the outer boundary, minimizing abrupt changes in terrain or obstruction.
