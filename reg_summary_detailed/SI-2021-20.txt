**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Certain Fees in Respect of the Issuance of Passports (2017 British Columbia Forest Fires) Remission Order"**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**
This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (specifically subsection 23(2.1)a), serves to **remit (i.e., waive or cancel) certain fees** associated with the issuance of Canadian passports for individuals affected by the **2017 British Columbia forest fires**.

The decision was made by **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**, based on recommendations from:
- The **Treasury Board**,
- The **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**, and  
- The **Minister of Foreign Affairs**.

The action was taken in the **public interest**, recognizing the significant disruption caused by the wildfires and the hardship experienced by residents in affected areas.

---

### **2. Legal Basis**
The Order is enacted under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Government of Canada to remit fees when it is in the public interest to do so. It is not a general fee reduction policy but a targeted, emergency measure.

This Order is **not a new law**, but rather a **remission order** that modifies the standard fee structure for passport services under existing regulations.

---

### **3. Scope of the Remission**
The remission applies to **fees paid or payable** under:
- **Paragraphs 7(a) to (c)** and **Item 14** of the *Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations* (SOR/91-24, s. 7(2)); or  
- **Section 4** of the *Consular Services Fees Regulations* (R.S., c. F-11).

These fees typically cover:
- Application fees for passport issuance,
- Renewal fees,
- Replacement fees (e.g., for lost, damaged, or destroyed passports).

The remission specifically applies to **fees related to replacing a passport** that was lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible due to the 2017 British Columbia forest fires.

### **4. Eligibility Criteria (Conditions for Remission)**

To qualify for the remission, an individual must meet **all of the following conditions**:

#### **Condition 1: Affected by the 2017 British Columbia Forest Fires**
- At some point between **July 7, 2017, and September 15, 2017**, the person:
  - Was **in** an area affected by a forest fire originating in British Columbia, **or**
  - Had their **residence** in such an area.

> *Note:* This establishes a direct link between the individual and the disaster, ensuring that only those genuinely impacted by the fires are eligible.

#### **Condition 2: Passport Was Lost, Damaged, Destroyed, or Rendered Inaccessible Due to the Fire**
- The passport in question was **lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible** while it was **valid** as a result of the forest fire referenced in Condition 1.

> *Important:* The damage or loss must be **caused by or directly related** to the fire. This ensures that the remission is not available for general passport replacement, but only when the fire is the cause.

#### **Condition 3: Application for a New Passport Was Made Within a Specific Window**
- The individual (or someone acting on their behalf) submitted a **new passport application** between:
  - **July 7, 2017**, and  
  - **January 6, 2018**.

> *Note:* This timeframe allows for a reasonable period to process applications after the fires and before the next fiscal or administrative review.

- The new passport must have the **same expiry date** as the original passport that was lost or damaged.

> *Purpose:* Ensures consistency in travel documentation and avoids creating a situation where individuals receive a passport with a different expiry date, which could lead to compliance issues.

#### **Condition 4: Declaration and Proof of Connection to the Fire Zone**
- The applicant must have included one of the following with the application:
  - A **declaration** stating that the passport was lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible **due to the forest fire** (as per Condition 1), **and**
  - **Proof** that at the time of the loss, the individual:
    - Was a **resident** of an area affected by the fire, **or**
    - Was **in** that area.

> *Note:* The declaration must be made by the individual or someone acting on their behalf. The proof (e.g., a letter, official notice, or documentation) must verify the person’s presence or residence during the relevant time.

> *This condition ensures accountability and prevents abuse of the remission by individuals who are not genuinely affected by the fire.*

#### **Condition 5: Fees Have Not Already Been Remitted**
- The fees in question **have not previously been remitted** under **Section 11** of the *Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations*.

> *Purpose:* Prevents double remission and ensures that the benefit is only granted once per individual.

### **5. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Targeted Relief** | The remission is not universal; it is strictly limited to those affected by the 2017 BC wildfires. |
| **Time-Sensitive** | The eligibility window (July 7, 2017 – January 6, 2018) ensures that the relief is provided in a timely manner after the disaster. |
| **Proof Required** | Applicants must provide evidence of residence or presence in the affected area to verify eligibility. |
| **No Fee for Replacement** | The fee for replacing the lost/damaged passport is waived — this includes administrative and processing costs. |

### **6. Legal and Administrative Significance**

- This Order demonstrates how the Canadian government can use **emergency powers** under the *Financial Administration Act* to provide **humanitarian relief** during natural disasters.
- It reflects a balance between **financial accountability** (fees are only waived under strict conditions) and **public service responsiveness** (supporting those directly impacted).
- It sets a precedent for future disaster-related fee remissions, potentially guiding similar actions in response to other emergencies (e.g., floods, hurricanes).

### **7. Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, temporary, and compassionate measure** designed to alleviate the financial burden on Canadian citizens who lost or damaged their passports due to the 2017 British Columbia forest fires. By waiving specific fees under strict eligibility criteria, the government ensures that those most affected by the disaster receive timely and equitable support without compromising the integrity of the passport system or the financial administration framework.

It is a practical example of how regulatory policy can respond to real-world events with both legal precision and humanitarian concern.
