**Detailed Summary of the CCRFTA Tariff Preference Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **Overview**

The *CCRFTA Tariff Preference Regulations*, made under the authority of the *Customs Tariff* and pursuant to the *Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement (CCRFTA) Implementation Act*, establish the conditions under which goods originating in Costa Rica may qualify for preferential tariff treatment when imported into Canada. These regulations are designed to implement the provisions of the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement, specifically to ensure that eligible goods from Costa Rica are subject to reduced or zero tariffs upon entry into Canada.

The regulations came into force on the date that **Section 37 of the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Chapter 28 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001)** came into effect. As noted in the footnote, these regulations were in force as of **November 1, 2002** (SI/2002-146).

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Eligibility for Tariff Preference (Paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff)**

Goods are entitled to the benefit of the **Costa Rica Tariff Preference** if they meet **one of the following conditions**:

---

##### **Condition A: Direct Shipment from Costa Rica to Canada**

- The goods must be **shipped directly from Costa Rica to Canada**.
- The shipment must be **without passage through any other country**.
- The shipment must be carried on a **through bill of lading**.

> A *through bill of lading* is a single document issued by a carrier that covers the entire journey from origin (Costa Rica) to destination (Canada), without requiring intermediate documents or transfers.

✅ This condition ensures that goods move directly between the two countries, minimizing the risk of non-compliance or diversion.

---

##### **Condition B: Direct Shipment Without a Through Bill of Lading**

- The goods are shipped from Costa Rica to Canada **without a through bill of lading**.
- In this case, the **importer must provide, upon request by a Canadian customs officer**, **documentary evidence** that:
  - Clearly shows the **shipping route**.
  - Identifies **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to arrival in Canada.

> This provision allows flexibility for shipments that may not use a through bill of lading (e.g., due to logistical or commercial reasons), as long as the importer can prove the goods were shipped directly from Costa Rica and did not pass through a third country.

---

##### **Condition C: Shipment Through a Third Country**

- Goods are shipped from Costa Rica to Canada **via a third country** (i.e., not a direct shipment).
- In this scenario, the importer must provide, upon request by a customs officer:
  1. **Documentary evidence** showing:
     - The **complete shipping route**.
     - All **points of shipment and transhipment** before arrival in Canada.
  2. A **copy of the customs control documents** that demonstrate:
     - The goods **remained under customs control** during their stay in the third country.

> This ensures that the goods did not enter the customs territory of a third country without proper control, which could compromise the integrity of the preferential treatment.

> The requirement that goods remain under customs control in the third country is critical — it prevents goods from being re-exported or diverted to non-preferential markets.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

- To **facilitate trade** between Canada and Costa Rica by reducing tariff barriers for qualifying goods.
- To **ensure compliance** with the CCRFTA by verifying that goods originate in Costa Rica and do not pass through third countries without proper documentation.
- To **prevent fraud or misuse** of preferential tariff treatment by requiring verifiable evidence of the shipping route and customs control.

---

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- Canadian customs officers have the authority to **request documentary evidence** from importers.
- Importers must be prepared to **provide accurate, complete, and verifiable documentation** to support claims of eligibility.
- Failure to provide required documentation may result in the **denial of preferential tariff treatment**, and the goods may be subject to standard tariff rates.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations came into force on the date that **Section 37 of the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** came into effect.
- As of **November 1, 2002**, these regulations were in force (as noted in SI/2002-146).

---

### **Legal Authority**

- Made under **paragraph 16(2)(b) of the Customs Tariff**.
- Based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.
- Implemented through the **Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act**, Chapter 28 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001.

---

### **Significance**

These regulations are a key component of Canada’s implementation of the CCRFTA. They provide a clear, structured framework for determining eligibility for tariff preferences, balancing trade facilitation with the need for transparency and compliance.

By establishing specific requirements for shipping routes and documentation, the regulations help ensure that only goods genuinely originating in Costa Rica and moving directly or through controlled channels benefit from preferential treatment.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *CCRFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* define the conditions under which goods from Costa Rica may be imported into Canada with reduced or zero tariffs. They emphasize **direct shipment**, **clear documentation**, and **customs control** during transit. The regulations are essential for maintaining the integrity of the free trade agreement while promoting fair and transparent trade practices between Canada and Costa Rica.

They remain in force as of November 1, 2002, and continue to serve as a foundational regulatory instrument in Canada’s regional trade policy.
