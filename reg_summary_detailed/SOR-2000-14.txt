---

### **Overview**
The *Military Police Professional Code of Conduct* is a formal set of ethical and professional standards established by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Defence**, under **section 13.1a of the National Defence Act (Act)**. This regulation outlines the expected behavior and conduct of military police personnel in Canada.

The Code was enacted to ensure that military police officers and non-commissioned members uphold the highest standards of integrity, impartiality, legality, and professionalism in the performance of their duties. It is designed to protect the rights of individuals, maintain public trust, and ensure accountability within the military police force.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

#### 1. **Definition of Key Terms**
- **"Act"** refers to the *National Defence Act*.
- The Code’s provisions are **not in derogation** of any powers, jurisdictions, or authorities granted under the Act or other federal laws. This means that the Code supplements, rather than replaces, existing legal authority.

#### 2. **Scope of Application**
- Applies exclusively to **officers and non-commissioned members** of the Canadian Armed Forces who are **appointed as military police** under regulations under **section 156 of the National Defence Act**.
- This includes personnel engaged in duties related to law enforcement, arrest, detention, search, surveillance, and investigation within the military context.

### **Prohibited Conduct (What Members Must Not Do)**

Members of the military police are strictly prohibited from engaging in any of the following behaviors:

| Prohibited Action | Explanation |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Knowingly supervise or carry out unlawful arrests, detentions, searches, or surveillance** | Officers cannot participate in actions that violate the law, even if they appear routine or authorized. "Without good cause" implies that any deviation from lawful procedures must be justified. |
| **Knowingly fail to report unlawful actions** | If a member becomes aware that an arrest, detention, search, or surveillance is unlawful or could reasonably be considered so, they must report it. Failure to do so constitutes a breach. |
| **Use or permit excessive force** | Any use of physical force must be proportionate, necessary, and justified. Excessive force is strictly prohibited. |
| **Discriminatory or discourteous behavior** | Officers must treat all individuals with fairness, respect, and professionalism, regardless of race, gender, religion, status, or other personal characteristics. |
| **Intimidate or retaliate against complainants** | Any person who reports misconduct or raises a complaint about a military police member must be protected from retaliation or threats. |
| **Unlawful discharge of a weapon** | Discharging a firearm without legal authority or in violation of safety and operational rules is strictly forbidden. |
| **Use of weapons in a dangerous or negligent manner** | Even if not intentional, reckless or careless use of weapons (e.g., improper handling, failure to follow safety protocols) is prohibited. |
| **Suppress, misrepresent, or falsify information** | All reports, statements, and records must be truthful and accurate. Falsification or suppression undermines investigations and erodes accountability. |
| **Improper interference with investigations** | Officers must not obstruct, influence, or interfere with the conduct of any official inquiry into misconduct. |
| **Misuse of military police resources or status** | Personnel must not use their position, access to information, or military police resources for personal gain, private benefit, or unauthorized purposes. |
| **Unauthorized disclosure of military police information** | Sensitive information (e.g., operational details, investigations, personnel records) may only be disclosed with proper authorization. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: These prohibitions apply even if the conduct appears minor or unintentional — the requirement is *knowing* or *willful* violation, especially when "without good cause."

### **Presumption of Discrediting Conduct**

A member of the military police is **presumed to have discredited the military police force** if they are convicted of:

1. **An offence under the National Defence Act**, **except**:
   - Offences tried at a **summary trial** where the punishment is:
     - A minor punishment, or
     - A fine of **not more than 25% of their basic monthly pay**.

2. **An indictable offence** or an **offence punishable on summary conviction** under any other Act of Parliament or provincial legislation.

> This presumption is significant because it affects disciplinary processes and can lead to automatic disqualification from military police duties or other consequences, even before a formal investigation.

### **Reporting Obligations**

#### 1. **Reporting Charges**
- Any member of the military police who has been **charged with an offence** under the National Defence Act or any other applicable law must **report this to their superior in the military police chain of command**.

#### 2. **Reporting Allegations of Breach**
- If a member believes or is aware of an allegation that another military police member has breached this Code, they must report it to:
  - Their **immediate superior** in the military police chain of command; **or**
  - The **next superior** up the chain, **if that superior is the subject of the allegation** (to avoid conflict of interest).

> This reporting mechanism encourages internal accountability and ensures that concerns are addressed promptly and fairly.

---

### **Right to Withhold Response in Investigations**

No member of the military police is excused from answering questions related to an investigation into a breach of this Code **unless**:
- The member is **the subject of the investigation**; or
- The member is the **assisting officer** for another member who is the subject of the investigation.

> This provision protects individuals from being compelled to testify in ways that could compromise their integrity or safety, but only in specific circumstances.

---

### **Protection from Use of Responses in Disciplinary Proceedings**

Responses given by a member under this Code (specifically, in response to inquiries about breaches) **shall not be used against the member’s interests** by the **Military Police Credentials Review Board** (established under Chapter 22 of the *Queen’s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces*).

> This is a critical safeguard to ensure that members are not punished for speaking out or cooperating in investigations. It protects the right to provide truthful, necessary information without fear of adverse consequences in formal review or disciplinary actions.

---

### **Effective Date**
- The Code comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published and recognized by the government).

1. **Professionalism & Accountability**

📌 **Key Takeaway**:  
Military police members must act with integrity, uphold the law, and report misconduct — both their own and others’. Violations are serious and carry significant consequences, including discrediting the force and potential disciplinary action. The Code also protects individuals from retaliation and ensures that responses to investigations are not used against them in formal reviews.
