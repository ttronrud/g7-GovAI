- **Effective Date**: August 12, 2021.
- **Legal Basis**: The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (commonly referred to as the "Public Service Rearrangement Act").
- **Reference to Statutes**:
  - *S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207*: This section of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22* (the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*) provides the legal framework for transferring responsibilities between federal departments and agencies.

#### **2. Key Action: Transfer of Responsibility**
- The **Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (FEDINO)** — a specific program or initiative within the **Department of Industry** — is being transferred from the Department of Industry to the newly established **Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario (FEDANO)**.
- This transfer includes:
  - **Control** over the operations of FEDINO.
  - **Supervision** of all activities and functions related to the initiative.
- The transfer is not a rebranding or minor adjustment but a structural realignment intended to improve the efficiency, accountability, and strategic focus of economic development efforts in Northern Ontario.

#### **3. Establishment and Leadership of the New Agency**
- The **Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario (FEDANO)** is established as a distinct federal agency responsible for implementing and managing economic development programs in Northern Ontario.
- The **Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages** is designated as the **presiding officer** (i.e., the head or chief executive) of FEDANO.
  - This role entails overall responsibility for the agency’s strategic direction, budget, staffing, and performance.
  - The minister is also responsible for ensuring alignment with federal economic development policy and regional priorities.

#### **4. Purpose and Implications**
- **Strategic Focus**: The move aims to centralize and strengthen federal support for economic development in Northern Ontario, an area historically underserved and facing challenges such as geographic isolation, limited infrastructure, and workforce shortages.
- **Improved Accountability and Responsiveness**: By transferring FEDINO to a dedicated agency, the government seeks to:
  - Enhance accountability and transparency.

- The 2021 transfer marks a shift from a program-based structure to a more autonomous agency model, reflecting a trend in Canadian federal governance to create specialized, outcome-focused agencies for regional development.
- This change may also be part of broader efforts to modernize public service delivery and improve performance outcomes in regional economic development.
