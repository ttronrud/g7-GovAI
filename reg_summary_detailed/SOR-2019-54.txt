### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Turkey Marketing Levies Order (2019)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The **Canada Turkey Marketing Levies Order (2019)** is a regulatory instrument issued by the **Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency (CTMA)** under the authority of the **Farm Products Agencies Act (FPA Act)**. This Order was established through the following legal foundations:

- The **Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency Proclamation** (proclaimed by the Governor in Council) created the CTMA under **subsection 16(1)(b)** of the FPA Act.
- The CTMA is empowered to implement a **marketing plan** to ensure fair pricing, market stability, and sustainable development in the turkey sector.
- This Order falls under **paragraph 7(1)(d)** of the FPA Act, which allows for the creation of orders that are necessary for implementing a marketing plan.
- It is governed by **section 2 of the Agencies’ Orders and Regulations Approval Order (AOAO)**, which provides a framework for approval processes.
- The Order was submitted to the **National Farm Products Council (NFPC)**, as required by **paragraph 22(1)(f)** of the FPA Act.
- The NFPC approved the Order after determining that it is **necessary and appropriate** for the implementation of the CTMA’s marketing plan.

As a result, the CTMA formally enacts this Order under **paragraphs 22(1)(f) and (g)** of the FPA Act and **section 10 of Part II of the Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency Proclamation**.

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of the **Canada Turkey Marketing Levies Order (2019)** is to:

- Establish **levies on turkey producers and processors** to fund the implementation of the CTMA’s marketing plan.
- Ensure that the costs of market development, price stabilization, research, promotion, and distribution are shared equitably among stakeholders.
- Provide a structured, transparent, and enforceable mechanism for collecting revenue from turkey trade in Canada.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The Order defines two key terms:

- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the **production of turkeys** within the "regulated area" (i.e., areas where turkeys are grown or raised).
- **Processor**: Any individual or entity engaged in the **slaughtering of turkeys** within the regulated area.

> Note: The term "turkey" refers to any variety, grade, or class of turkey.

#### **4. Levies and Payment Obligations**

##### **A. Producer Levies (Section 2)**

Every producer in the regulated area must pay two levies on each kilogram of live turkey marketed in **inter-provincial or export trade**:

1. **Production Levy**:
   - Determined based on the **province of the producer**.
   - Found in **Column 2 of Schedule 1**, corresponding to the producer’s province (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, etc.).

2. **Marketing Levy**:
   - Also determined by the **producer’s province**.
   - Found in **Column 2 of Schedule 2**, corresponding to the producer’s province.

> *Example*: A turkey producer in Saskatchewan would pay the production and marketing levies specified for Saskatchewan in Schedules 1 and 2.

##### **B. Payment Timelines for Producers**

- **If the producer sells to a non-processor** (e.g., a retailer, distributor, or export buyer):
  - The producer must remit the total levies (production + marketing) to the **Commodity Board of the relevant province** within **60 days after the end of the month** in which the turkeys were marketed.

- **If the producer sells to a processor**:
  - The **processor deducts** the levies from the total payment made to the producer.
  - The processor then remits the levies to the **Commodity Board of the relevant province** within **60 days after the end of the month** in which the turkeys were marketed.

> This ensures that the levy is collected at the point of sale, regardless of whether the buyer is a processor or not.

---

##### **C. Processor Levies (Section 4)**

Each processor located in a province listed in **Column 1 of Schedule 2** must pay a **marketing levy** on each kilogram of live turkey they slaughter and market in **inter-provincial or export trade**.

- The levy amount is specified in **Column 3 of Schedule 2**, based on the processor’s province.

> *Note*: This levy applies only to processors who slaughter turkeys **marketed to them by producers**.

##### **D. Payment Timeline for Processors**

- Processors must remit the marketing levy to the **Commodity Board of the relevant province** within **60 days after the end of the month** in which the turkeys are marketed.

---

#### **5. Collection Mechanism**

- The **Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency** appoints **Commodity Boards** for each province (in accordance with **subsection 10(4)** of the Proclamation).
- These Commodity Boards are **authorized to collect** the levies from producers and processors **on behalf of the Agency**.
- The appointment requires **concurrence from the relevant provincial authority** (as per **section 6** of the AOAO).

##### **Collection and Remittance Requirements**

- If a province’s Commodity Board **concurs** with the appointment:
  - It must remit **all levies collected** under Sections 3 and 5 to the **CTMA** within **30 days of the end of the month** in which collection occurs.

- If a province’s Commodity Board **does not concur**:
  - The levies must be **directly remitted to the CTMA** by all producers and processors **on the day the Agency directs**.

> This ensures that revenue is always collected and accounted for by the Agency, even if a provincial board declines to act.

---

#### **6. Expiry and Transitional Provisions**

The Order includes **time-limited provisions** to ensure gradual transition and eventual phase-out:

- **Paragraph 2(a)** (relating to the production levy) ceases to have effect on **March 31, 2026**.
- **Paragraph 2(b)** and **Section 4** (relating to the marketing levy for processors) cease to have effect on **December 31, 2028**.

> This means that:
> - The production levy will be phased out after 2026.
> - The processor marketing levy will be phased out after 2028.

This reflects a planned transition toward a more sustainable or market-based system, possibly with revised or alternative funding mechanisms.

---

#### **7. Repeal of Prior Order**

- The **Canada Turkey Marketing Producers Levy Order 2002 (SOR/2002-142)** is **repealed** by this 2019 Order.
- This ensures that the current, updated levy structure replaces the outdated 2002 framework.

---

#### **8. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
