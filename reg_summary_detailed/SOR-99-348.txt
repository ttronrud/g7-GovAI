**Detailed Summary of the Regulations Prescribing Networks (Copyright Act)**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

The regulations are issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**, under two specific provisions of the *Copyright Act*:

- **Section 30.8a** of the *Copyright Act*  
- **Subsection 62(1)b** of the *Copyright Act*

These provisions empower the government to prescribe certain entities or groupings as "networks" for the purposes of copyright law, particularly in relation to the rights and obligations of programming undertakings in the context of broadcasting and content sharing.

**Purpose of the Regulations:**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define and prescribe what constitutes a "network"** for the purposes of **subsection 30.8(9)** of the *Copyright Act*. This provision is critical in determining how copyright ownership, licensing, and royalties apply to programming content shared across affiliated or connected entities.

**Definition of Prescribed Networks:**

Under these regulations, the following types of entities are recognized as **prescribed networks**:

1. **Networks as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Broadcasting Act**  
   - This refers to the statutory definition of a "network" under the *Broadcasting Act*, which generally includes:
     - A group of stations or services that are connected through a common transmission system or programming structure.
     - Networks that operate under a centralized control or coordination system, such as national or regional broadcasting networks (e.g., CBC, CTV, or Global).
     - These networks may include a main station and affiliated local stations that broadcast content from a central source.

2. **Networks consisting of two or more programming undertakings that are:**
   - **Owned by the same person or group of persons**, or  
   - That have a **practice of common programming** or an **arrangement by which they share programs**.

   This includes:
   - **Affiliated companies** (e.g., a parent company owning multiple television or radio stations).
   - **Shared programming arrangements** (e.g., co-producing or co-broadcasting content across multiple stations).
   - **Syndication or content-sharing agreements** where stations coordinate programming schedules or content distribution.

**Key Legal Effect:**

By prescribing these entities as "networks," the regulations establish that such groupings are treated as a single entity for the purposes of copyright law. This has practical implications, including:

- Determining who holds or is entitled to copyright in programming content.
- Establishing the scope of rights and licensing obligations for content shared across affiliated stations.
- Influencing royalty payments, licensing fees, and enforcement of copyright protections when programming is distributed across multiple platforms or stations.

**Effective Date:**

The regulations come into force on **October 1, 1999**.

**Significance and Context:**

This regulation was introduced during a period of significant evolution in Canadian broadcasting and media ownership. As media conglomerates grew and ownership patterns became more complex, the need to clearly define what constitutes a "network" for copyright purposes became essential. By formalizing the criteria for network status, the regulations:

- Provide clarity and consistency in how copyright law applies to affiliated broadcasting entities.
- Support fair licensing and royalty practices.
- Help prevent copyright infringement by ensuring that shared programming is properly attributed and compensated.

**Conclusion:**

The *Regulations Prescribing Networks (Copyright Act)* establish a clear, legally binding definition of what constitutes a "network" under Canadian copyright law. By including both statutory networks under the *Broadcasting Act* and business arrangements involving shared ownership or programming, the regulations ensure that copyright rights are appropriately managed in complex media environments. The rules are foundational in enabling fair and transparent licensing practices in the Canadian broadcasting sector.
