### **Detailed Summary of the Unemployment Insurance (Collection of Premiums) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Citation and Key Definitions**

- **Regulation Title**: *Unemployment Insurance (Collection of Premiums) Regulations*  
- **Citation**: These Regulations may be cited as the *Unemployment Insurance (Collection of Premiums) Regulations*.

##### **Key Definitions**:
- **Act**: Refers to the *Unemployment Insurance Act* (Loi).
- **Minister**: The Minister of National Revenue (ministre).
- **Pay Period**: The period during which an insured person receives or enjoys remuneration (e.g., weekly, biweekly, monthly).
- **Pay Week**: A period of seven consecutive days ending on an employer’s payroll ending date. If multiple pay weeks are contiguous, the last one determines the pay week.

> These definitions form the foundation for how earnings and premiums are calculated and collected.

---

#### **2. Scope of Coverage: Who is Included?**

- **Employer**: Any person who pays or has paid remuneration or earnings to an insured person for services performed in *insurable employment*.
- **Insurable Employment**: Work that is eligible for unemployment insurance coverage.

> This ensures that only those engaged in qualifying employment are subject to premium obligations.

---

#### **3. What Constitutes "Earnings from Insurable Employment"?**

Earnings include:
- All remuneration (cash or non-cash) received for insurable employment.
- Includes allowances, bonuses, overtime, shift premiums, cost-of-living adjustments, and incentive payments.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Value of board, lodging, or other benefits **if no cash remuneration is paid** in that pay period.
  - For clergy: Value of lodging provided by the diocese, parish, or congregation.
  - Any income excluded under **paragraphs 6(1)(a) or (b)** or **subsections 6(6) or (16)** of the *Income Tax Act*.

> This clarifies what is considered taxable and insurable income.

---

#### **4. Allocation of Earnings to Pay Periods**

Earnings are allocated based on when they are paid or when they are earned:

| Type of Earnings | Allocation Rule |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Regular remuneration | Allocated to the pay period in which it is paid. |
| Overtime, bonuses, sick leave, shift premiums, incentives, cost-of-living allowances, separation payments, wages in lieu of notice | Allocated to the pay period in which they are paid. |
| Remuneration not paid in a pay period | Allocated to the pay period in which it is actually paid. |

> **Exception for Unpaid Leave, Abandonment, Dismissal, or Layoff**:
- If an employee is on unpaid leave, has abandoned employment, or has been dismissed/laid off, remuneration (e.g., bonuses, allowances) is allocated to the **last regular pay period** before the event.

> This ensures continuity in premium calculation even during transitions out of employment.

---

#### **5. Exclusion of Earnings from "Excepted Employment"**

- **No premium is payable** on earnings from **excepted employment** (e.g., work not covered under the insurance scheme).
- This protects individuals whose work is outside the scope of unemployment insurance.

---

#### **6. Determining Premium Amounts**

Premiums are calculated based on **insurable earnings** using a tiered structure with **incremental rates**:

##### **Step-by-Step Premium Calculation**:

1. **Earnings Range Structure**:
   - The insurable earnings are divided into ranges up to **$3,900.00**.
   - The premium rate starts at **$0.50** and increases in **recurring cycles** of **$0.34 increments**, with **$0.33** used in specific cycles (e.g., every 12th or 24th range).

   - **First 12 ranges** (up to $3,880.50):  
     Starts at $0.50, increases by $0.34, with **$0.33** used in some cycles.

   - **Next 56 ranges** (up to $3,899.49):  
     All increments are $0.34, with **$0.33** used in specific intervals.

   - **Final two ranges** ($3,899.50 to $3,900):  
     Premium rate is **$0.50 and $0.01** (i.e., $0.51 total).

2. **Premium Formula**:
   > **Premium = Insurable Earnings × Premium Rate**

3. **Rounding Rules**:
   - If the product results in a **fraction of a cent**, it is **rounded to the nearest cent**.
   - If equidistant between two cents, **round up** to the higher cent.

> This ensures precise and consistent premium calculations.

---

#### **7. Cap on Employee Premiums**

- An employee’s premium **shall not exceed** the premium payable on **maximum insurable earnings** for a pay period.
- Maximum insurable earnings are determined under **sections 5, 8, and 9** of the Act.

> This prevents overcharging and ensures fairness.

---

#### **8. Employer Remittance Obligations**

Every employer must remit **employees’ premiums** and **employer’s premiums** to the **Receiver General** within strict deadlines.

##### **Standard Deadline**:
- **On or before the 15th day of the month** following the month in which remuneration was paid.

##### **Special Deadlines for Employers with High Average Monthly Withholding**:

| Employer Category | Deadline Rules |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Average monthly withholding ≥ $15,000 and < $50,000** | - Earnings paid **before the 16th day** → due by **25th**<br>- Earnings paid **after the 15th day** → due by **10th of next month** |
| **Average monthly withholding ≥ $50,000** | - Must remit by the **third day after the end of the following periods**:<br>  1. First 7 days of the month<br>  2. 8th to 14th day<br>  3. 15th to 21st day<br>  4. 22nd to end of month<br> - Deadline is **not on a Saturday or holiday** |

> These staggered deadlines help manage large volumes of remittances and ensure timely collection.

---

#### **9. Election to Change Remittance Schedule**

An employer may **elect to follow the standard 15th-day rule** instead of the accelerated schedule **if**:
- The **average monthly withholding** for the **prior calendar year** is **less than $15,000**, **or**
- The average is **≥ $15,000 but < $50,000**, and the employer **advises the Minister** of the election.

> This provides flexibility for smaller or less active employers.

---

#### **10. Determining Average Monthly Withholding**

- The **average monthly withholding amount** is calculated under **subsections 108(1.2) and (1.3)** of the *Income Tax Regulations*.
- It reflects the total premiums paid over the year, divided by the number of months.

> This metric determines eligibility for special remittance schedules.

---

#### **11. Final Remittance Upon Business Closure**

- Any employer who **ceases operations** must remit all outstanding employee and employer premiums **within seven days** of ceasing business.
- This ensures no outstanding liabilities remain.

---

#### **12. Required Documentation**

- Every remittance must be accompanied by an **authorized information return**.
- These returns provide detailed records of earnings, premiums, and payments.

> Ensures transparency and auditability.

---

#### **13. Prescribed Persons (Special Remittance Obligations)**

Certain entities are designated as **"prescribed persons"** under subsection 53(1) of the Act and must remit premiums:

- **Employers** required to remit under subsection 53(1) of the Act.
- **Persons or partnerships** acting on behalf of multiple employers, **if**:
  - Their **average monthly remittance** (across all employers) for the **second year before the current year** is **≥ $50,000**.
  - They remit:
    - Premiums under the Unemployment Insurance Act,
    - Premiums under the Income Tax Act (subsection 153(1)), and
    - Canada Pension Plan (subsection 21(1)) contributions.

> This allows for consolidated reporting and compliance for multi-employer entities.

| Pay Period Type | Maximum Insurable Earnings |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Pay Week | Maximum weekly insurable earnings |
| Multiple of pay week | Weekly max × number of weeks |
| Semi-monthly | Annual max ÷ 24 |
