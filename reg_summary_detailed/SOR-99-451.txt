### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Regulation**
- The referenced regulation was a **provision (section 58)** within a prior regulatory instrument.
- The exact name of the original regulation is not provided in your input, but such repeals typically occur in administrative or environmental regulations (e.g., under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act*, *Fisheries Act*, or *Occupational Health and Safety Regulations*).
- Section 58 likely dealt with a specific rule, such as:
  - Licensing requirements,
  - Reporting obligations,
  - Environmental standards,
  - Worker safety procedures,
  - Compliance timelines, or
  - Penalties for violations.

#### 2. **Repeal Details**
- **Repeal Date**: April 15, 2015
- **Legal Instrument**: *Order in Council SOR/2015-103*
- **Section Repealed**: Section 58 of the original regulation
- **Reason for Repeal**: The repeal was likely due to:
  - Obsolescence (the provision was no longer relevant),
  - Inconsistency with updated laws or policies,
  - Redundancy (it duplicated or overlapped with other provisions),
  - A decision by the federal government to streamline regulations,
  - A shift in policy or regulatory framework (e.g., new legislation replacing the old one).

#### 3. **Legal Significance**
- Once a regulation is repealed by an Order in Council, it **ceases to have legal effect**.
- Any actions or obligations based on the repealed section are no longer enforceable.
- The repeal is **publicly recorded** in the Canada Gazette and is binding on all government agencies and private parties.
- It may also trigger a review of related sections to ensure regulatory coherence.

#### 4. **Implications**
- **For Regulated Parties**: Individuals or organizations previously subject to section 58 no longer need to comply with its requirements.
- **For Government Agencies**: The agency responsible for administering the regulation must update its guidance, forms, or enforcement procedures to reflect the removal of the section.
- **For Legal Interpretation**: Courts or regulatory bodies will no longer consider section 58 as part of the current legal framework.

#### 5. **Why Repeated Entries?**
The repetition of the same line appears to be a formatting or data entry error. It may have resulted from:
- A copy-paste error,
- A database or document that failed to properly parse or display the regulation list,
- A placeholder or template that was not cleaned.

Therefore, **only one unique entry is legally significant**: the repeal of section 58 under SOR/2015-103.

### Conclusion

> **Section 58 of the relevant regulation has been officially repealed by Order in Council SOR/2015-103, effective April 15, 2015. This means the provision is no longer in force and cannot be used to establish legal obligations or requirements. The repeal reflects a change in regulatory policy or administrative efficiency, and all parties must adjust their compliance practices accordingly.**

⚠️ **Note**: Without knowing the original regulation (e.g., *Fisheries Act*, *Canadian Environmental Protection Act*, etc.), a more specific summary cannot be provided. To identify the exact regulation, the original title or context (e.g., "regulation concerning fishing vessels") would be required.

If you can provide the name of the original regulation or the context in which section 58 was used, I can offer a more detailed and accurate summary.
