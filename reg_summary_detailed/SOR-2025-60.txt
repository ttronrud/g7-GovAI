Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the regulation titled:

> **"Designating Certain Excluded Classes of Projects under subsection 88(1) of the Impact Assessment Act"**  
> (S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 1; Effective February 27, 2025)

This regulation, issued by the **Minister of the Environment**, designates certain classes of projects as **exempt from mandatory environmental impact assessments (EIAs)** under the *Impact Assessment Act (IAA)* — provided that they are deemed to cause only **insignificant adverse environmental effects**.

---

## 🔍 **Background and Legal Basis**

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
The Minister has determined that specific types of projects — when carried out on federal lands or outside Canada — will result in **only insignificant environmental harm**. Therefore, under **section 88(1)** of the *Impact Assessment Act*, these projects are **designated as exempt** from the full impact assessment process.

### **2. Legal Authority**
- The Minister relies on **subsection 89(2)** of the IAA, which requires that public comments be considered in determining whether a project should be designated.
- The decision was made after reviewing public input, ensuring transparency and public engagement.

### **3. Repeal of Previous Order**
- The prior *Designated Classes of Projects Order* (SOR/2019-323) is **repealed**, meaning this new Order supersedes it.

## 📚 Key Definitions

The regulation provides precise definitions to ensure clarity and consistency across all project categories:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Impact Assessment Act* |
| **Allied Petroleum Product** | As defined in the *Storage Tank Systems for Petroleum Products and Allied Petroleum Products Regulations* |
| **Building** | A roofed physical structure, including moveable accommodations (e.g., tents, trailers) |
| **Developed Land** | Land permanently altered for human use or landscaped and maintained for such use |
| **Expansion** | Increase in exterior dimensions or production capacity of a physical work |
| **Hook-up** | A structure or line connecting a physical work to a main utility (gas, water, power, etc.) |
| **Modification** | Change to a physical work that does not alter its purpose or function (excluding expansion or relocation) |
| **Petroleum Product** | As defined in the same storage regulations |
| **Water Body** | Includes lakes, rivers, reservoirs, oceans, tributaries, and wetlands up to the annual high-water mark. **Excludes** ditches without fish habitat, waste lagoons, mine ponds, irrigation ponds, and dugouts |
| **Wetland** | Areas where water influences soil formation and supports water-tolerant vegetation (e.g., marshes, swamps, bogs) |

> ⚠️ **Note on Physical Work**: Includes all systems and equipment necessary for operation (e.g., HVAC, security, electrical), **but excludes** systems that produce goods or energy for purposes other than operation.

## 🏗️ Designated Classes of Projects (Exempt from EIAs)

The regulation outlines **three main schedules** of exempt projects, each with specific conditions and geographic applicability.

---

### ✅ **Schedule 1 & 2: General Exemptions (Federal Lands & Parks Canada)**

#### **Applicability**
- Projects listed in **Schedule 1** are exempt when carried out on **federal lands or outside Canada**.
- Projects in **Schedule 2** are exempt when carried out on **federal lands administered by Parks Canada**.

#### **Excluded Activities (Even if in Schedule)**
The following activities **do not qualify** for exemption, regardless of the schedule:
1. Projects that change:
   - Water level of a water body
   - Alignment of a watercourse
   - Characteristics of a wetland
2. Activities involving **listed wildlife species** under the *Species at Risk Act* (e.g., their residences or critical habitats)
3. Any activity under **subsection 5(1) of the Migratory Birds Regulations, 2022**, unless specifically allowed under subsection 5(2)
4. Release of a **deleterious substance** into a water body (as defined in Fisheries Act s.34(1))
5. Activities prohibited under:
   - *Canadian Navigable Waters Act*
   - *Fisheries Act* (s.34.4(1), 35(1), 36(3))
   - *Scott Islands Protected Marine Area Regulations*
6. Removal or damage to:
   - Historical, archaeological, paleontological, or architectural resources
7. Damage to such significant structures or sites

> 🔍 **Key Point**: Even if a project fits within a schedule, if it triggers one of these exclusions, it **must undergo a full environmental assessment**.

---

### ✅ **Schedule 3: Wildlife Areas (Parks Canada-Managed Zones)**

- Applies to projects in areas referred to in **Schedule I of the Wildlife Area Regulations**
- Applies only to **federal lands managed by Parks Canada**

> ⚠️ Same exclusions apply as in Schedules 1 and 2.

---

## 🏗️ Detailed Project Categories (Schedules 1–3)

Each schedule includes specific project types, with **size and location-based limits**.

---

### 🔹 Part 1: Operation, Maintenance, or Repair of Physical Works

- Includes routine operations (e.g., cleaning, repairs, upgrades) of any physical work
- **Excludes**:
  - Projects involving work in water bodies
  - Disturbance of known or suspected subsurface contamination (unless located in a **closed site** in the Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory and **does not require risk management**)

---

### 🔹 Part 2: Interior Building Activities

- Any physical activity **entirely within the interior of a building**
- Excludes activities involving exterior construction or water body interaction

---

### 🔹 Part 3: Geotechnical/Scientific Wells

- Construction of wells for **geotechnical, environmental, or scientific investigations**
- **Excludes**:
  - Placing temporary or permanent fill in a water body
