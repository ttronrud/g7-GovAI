### **Detailed Summary of the Yorkton Airport Zoning Regulations (1987)**

The **Yorkton Airport Zoning Regulations**, made under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act*, are a set of legally binding rules designed to ensure the safe operation of Yorkton Airport in Saskatchewan by controlling land use and physical development in its vicinity. These regulations were established following a public consultation process and are intended to minimize hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Adoption**

- **Authority**: The regulations were adopted under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Minister of Transport to make zoning regulations for airports.
- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the regulations was published in:
  - Two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **May 16 and May 23, 1987**.
  - Two successive issues of the *Yorkton Enterprise* on **June 29 and July 6, 1987**.
- This provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, local communities, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- After review, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, formally enacted the regulations.

## **2. Name and Scope**

- **Regulation Title**: *Yorkton Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Applicability**: Applies to all lands:
  - Within the **outer limits** described in **Part VI of the Schedule**; and
  - Directly beneath any portion of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond those outer limits.

> These lands include public road allowances adjacent to the airport.

## **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Yorkton Airport in the vicinity of Yorkton, Saskatchewan. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used for elevation and spatial calculations. Located 61.4 m southwesterly from the centerline of runway 12–30, and 270.1 m southeasterly along that centerline from the intersection of runways 03–21 and 12–30. |
| **Elevation of ARP** | **487 meters above sea level** — used as a baseline for all surface elevations. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip, designed to prevent obstacles from interfering with aircraft during approach. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the runway strip and its approach surfaces, connecting to the outer surface. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP** (i.e., 487 + 45 = 532 m ASL), **except** where this would be less than 9 meters above ground level — in which case it is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing area, including the runway, designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. |

## **4. Key Provisions**

### **(a) Prohibition on Obstruction**

No person may:
- Construct or erect any **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing structures),
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

> This ensures that no structure or object will interfere with aircraft during approach, takeoff, or flight paths.

### **(b) Natural Growth Regulation**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes, vegetation) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), the **Minister may require the owner or occupier to remove** the excessive growth.

> This prevents uncontrolled vegetation from becoming a hazard to aircraft.

### **(c) Waste Disposal Ban**

- No owner or occupier may allow land under these regulations to be used for:
  - Disposal of **waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> This is a critical measure to reduce bird strikes — a major aviation hazard — by preventing food sources that attract birds near the airport.

## **5. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

### **(i) Airport Reference Point (ARP)**  
- Located at 487 m ASL.
- Coordinates:
  - 61.4 m **southwesterly** from the centerline of runway 12–30.
  - 270.1 m **southeasterly** along the centerline of runway 12–30 from the intersection of runways 03–21 and 12–30.

### **(ii) Approach Surfaces**  
Each approach surface is designed to protect aircraft during final descent. They vary slightly by runway due to different approach angles and distances.

| Runway Approach | Inclination Ratio | Horizontal Distance | Height of Imaginary Line | Width of Horizontal Line |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Runway 12 (approach) | 1:40 (1 m vertical per 40 m horizontal) | 2,500 m from end | 62.5 m above end elevation | 295 m from centerline |
| Runway 30 (approach) | 1:40 | 2,500 m from end | 62.5 m above end elevation | 295 m from centerline |
| Runway 03 (approach) | 1:50 | 3,000 m from end | 60 m above end elevation | 375 m from centerline |
| Runway 21 (approach) | 1:50 | 3,000 m from end | 60 m above end elevation | 375 m from centerline |

> These surfaces slope upward from the runway ends and extend outward in a controlled manner to ensure aircraft have a clear path.

### **(iii) Outer Surface**  
- Located at a **constant elevation of 45 m above the ARP (532 m ASL)**.
- Exception: If the ground elevation is higher than 45 m above ARP, the outer surface is **set at 9 m above ground level** — ensuring it does not fall below ground level.

> This defines the upper boundary of all development and obstruction control.

### **(iv) Strips (Runway Areas)**  
- **Runway 12–30**:
  - 90 m wide (45 m on each side of centerline)
  - 1,156.3 m long
- **Runway 03–21**:
  - 150 m wide (75 m on each side)
  - 1,583 m long

> These are the active landing zones where aircraft take off and land.

### **(v) Transitional Surfaces**  
- Connect the lateral edges of the strips and their approach surfaces to the outer surface.
- Slope upward at different ratios depending on the runway:

| Runway | Slope Ratio | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 12–30 | 1:5 (1 m vertical per 5 m horizontal) | Rises from strip edges to meet outer surface or adjacent transitional surface |
| 03–21 | 1:7 (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal) | Steeper gradient than 12–30 due to longer lateral extent |

> These surfaces prevent obstructions from forming between the runway edges and the outer surface.

## **6. Boundary of Outer Limits**

The boundary of the regulated land area is defined in a detailed, precise **survey description** based on land sections, road allowances, and registered plans. Key features include:

- Starts at the **NW corner of NW Quarter of Section 28, T26R4W**.
- Progresses **easterly, northerly, westerly, southerly**, and across various **road allowances** and **section boundaries**.
- Passes through:
  - Sections 28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 31, 29, 20, 19, 18, 12, 10, 9, 6, 16
- Includes references to **Registered Plans**:
  - BY 5472 (road)
  - 71Y08466 (road)
  - 80Y02225, 77Y13453, 64Y01132 (blocks)
  - CH3739 (Canadian National Railway)
  - AB 2423, AH 2080 (railway and boundary lines)

> This boundary forms a large, irregular polygon encompassing the airport and surrounding areas, ensuring comprehensive protection of flight zones.

## **7. Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve several critical functions:

1. **Safety**:
   - Prevents aircraft from encountering obstacles during takeoff, landing, and approach.
   - Reduces risk of collision with structures, trees, or terrain.

2. **Aviation Operations**:
   - Provides a standardized, legally enforceable framework for airport
