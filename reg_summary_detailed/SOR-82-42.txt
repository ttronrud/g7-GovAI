**Detailed Summary of the New Brunswick Hog Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *New Brunswick Hog Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act (New Brunswick)**. This Order grants the **New Brunswick Hog Marketing Board (Local Board)** the authority to regulate the **marketing of hogs in interprovincial and export trade** originating from New Brunswick.

The Order may be cited as the *New Brunswick Hog Order* and serves as a key component of New Brunswick’s agricultural marketing framework, specifically tailored to the hog industry.

### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Order establishes the following definitions:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* of New Brunswick. This foundational legislation provides the legal basis for regulating agricultural product marketing, including hogs.
  
- **Hog**: Defined broadly as *any animal of the porcine species produced in New Brunswick*. This includes both live hogs and those at various stages of processing or transport, as long as they are raised within the province.

- **Local Board**: Refers to the **New Brunswick Hog Marketing Board**, a statutory body established under the Act to oversee and manage the marketing of hogs. This body has the regulatory powers to act both locally and in interprovincial/export markets.

- **Plan**: Denotes any marketing plan established and amended over time in accordance with the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* and any related regulations. The Plan outlines procedures, guidelines, and objectives for the marketing of hogs, including pricing, distribution, and market access strategies.

### **Primary Authority Granted to the Local Board**

The Local Board is granted **specific regulatory powers** to manage the marketing of hogs in **interprovincial and export trade**, including the following:

#### 1. **Regulatory Powers Equivalent to Local Marketing Authority**
The Local Board may, with respect to persons and property located within New Brunswick, exercise **all or any powers** that it currently holds under the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* and the *Plan* when it comes to **local marketing of hogs**. This means that the powers used for domestic marketing—such as setting marketing standards, overseeing sales, and managing producer participation—are directly transferable to the interprovincial and export contexts.

This provision ensures **consistency and continuity** in how hogs are marketed, both within the province and beyond, reducing administrative fragmentation and promoting fairness.

---

#### 2. **Authority to Impose Levies or Charges**

The Local Board is empowered to:

- **Fix levies or charges** on individuals or entities involved in the **marketing of hogs** in interprovincial and export markets.
- **Classify** these marketing participants into **different groups** (e.g., based on size of operation, type of market, or volume of sales).
- **Set different levies or charges** for each group, allowing for a tiered or differentiated system that accounts for varying levels of involvement or capacity.

For example:
- A small farmer selling hogs directly to a processor may be charged a lower fee than a large exporter or a regional distributor.

This classification ensures **fairness and equity**, preventing disproportionate burdens on small producers while enabling the Board to generate revenue based on market activity.

---

#### 3. **Collection of Levies and Charges**

The Board has the authority to **collect** the levies or charges from those persons engaged in interprovincial or export marketing of hogs. This includes enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance and payment.

---

#### 4. **Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to provide financial buffers during market downturns or price volatility).
- **Payment of operational expenses** associated with marketing activities (e.g., market research, logistics, promotion).
- **Covering losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of hogs (e.g., price collapses, unsold inventory, or market disruptions).
- **Equalizing or adjusting** the financial returns among hog producers.

This last function is particularly significant. It allows the Board to **distribute financial benefits or compensate producers** who may have suffered losses due to market fluctuations, thereby stabilizing income and supporting long-term producer viability.

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Order**

The overarching goals of the *New Brunswick Hog Order* include:

- **Stabilizing the hog market** by providing a structured, transparent, and equitable system for interprovincial and export trade.
- **Protecting producers** from market volatility through financial safeguards and revenue-sharing mechanisms.
- **Ensuring fair competition** among marketing participants by applying consistent rules and fees.
- **Promoting efficient and sustainable marketing practices** that support both domestic and international markets.
- **Maintaining the integrity of New Brunswick’s hog supply chain** by centralizing oversight and accountability.

---

### **Legal Basis and Governance**

- The Order is made under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to issue regulations to regulate the marketing of agricultural products.
- The Local Board operates under the authority of the Act and the Plan, ensuring that its actions are aligned with broader agricultural policy objectives.
- The Board is accountable to the Minister of Agriculture and subject to oversight mechanisms established under the Act.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Interprovincial and Export Trade Focus**: Unlike traditional local marketing rules, this Order specifically targets the movement of hogs beyond New Brunswick’s borders, addressing a critical aspect of the province’s agricultural economy.
- **Financial Resilience**: By enabling the creation of reserves and loss-sharing mechanisms, the Order helps producers weather economic downturns and price shocks.
- **Market Transparency**: The classification of participants into groups allows for more precise and equitable financial arrangements.
- **Support for Rural Economies**: Hog farming is a key agricultural activity in New Brunswick, especially in rural communities. This Order supports the sustainability of these operations by ensuring stable and fair market access.

### **Conclusion**

The *New Brunswick Hog Order* is a targeted, practical, and legally sound regulatory measure designed to ensure the **fair, efficient, and sustainable marketing of hogs** in both interprovincial and international markets. By empowering the New Brunswick Hog Marketing Board to impose structured levies, classify participants, and use collected funds for financial stability and equity, the Order strengthens the province’s agricultural sector and protects the interests of hog producers in a dynamic and often volatile market environment.

This regulation exemplifies how provincial governments can use marketing boards to balance market efficiency with producer protection—particularly in commodity-based industries like hog farming.
