The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of certain provisions under the **Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)**, specifically:

- **SOR/2008-273, s. 47** — This section repeals a prior regulation.
- **SOR/2000-102, s. 17** — This section also repeals a prior regulation.

However, **no actual regulation content** is included in the text. Instead, the entries are only labels indicating that specific sections of prior statutory rules have been **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled or removed from legal effect).

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entries**
Each line in the list:
> [Repealed, SOR/2008-273, s. 47]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2000-102, s. 17]

indicates that a particular regulation or provision was **repealed** (removed) by a later amendment or legislative action. These are **repeal notices**, not active regulations.

- **SOR/2008-273, s. 47** means:  
  Section 47 of the Statutory Regulation issued on January 1, 2008 (SOR/2008-273) contains a provision that **repeals** an earlier rule.  
  The specific rule being repealed is not named in the text, only that it was repealed by this section.

- **SOR/2000-102, s. 17** means:  
  Section 17 of the Statutory Regulation issued on May 1, 2000 (SOR/2000-102) contains a provision that **repeals** a prior regulation.

#### 2. **Repeal Context**
Repeal means the regulation is no longer in force. It is typically done to:
- Remove outdated or obsolete rules
- Align with new legislation
- Correct errors or inconsistencies
- Reflect changes in policy or administrative structure

Since the original regulation being repealed is not specified, the summary cannot detail its content or purpose. The repeals are **declarative** — they state that a rule no longer exists — but do not describe what it was.

#### 3. **Frequency of Repeals**
The repeated entries (e.g., 18 times for SOR/2008-273, s. 47) suggest a possible **data or formatting error**. In official legal documents, such repetition is unusual and likely stems from a copy-paste or technical glitch. It does not imply that multiple separate regulations were repealed under the same section — rather, it reflects a formatting issue.

#### 4. **Legal Significance**
- These repeals are **binding** in legal terms: once a regulation is repealed, it ceases to have legal force.
- The repeal is effective from the date the SOR is published (e.g., January 1, 2008, or May 1, 2000).
- Subsequent regulations or policies must refer to the current, active version of the rule (if any), not the repealed one.

#### 5. **Missing Information**
The following details are **not available** in the provided text:
- The name of the original regulation being repealed
- The subject matter (e.g., licensing, environmental standards, health, etc.)
- The date of repeal
- The reason for repeal
- The legal or policy context

### Conclusion:

**There is no active regulation described in the provided text.**  
Instead, the list consists of **repeal notices** indicating that certain prior regulations were formally canceled by amendments in:

- **SOR/2008-273, section 47**  
- **SOR/2000-102, section 17**

These repeals signify that the associated rules are no longer in effect. However, due to the lack of specific content and the repeated, likely erroneous formatting, **a detailed summary of the actual regulation being repealed cannot be provided**.

To obtain a meaningful summary, one would need to:
1. Identify the original regulation repealed by SOR/2008-273, s. 47 or SOR/2000-102, s. 17.
2. Access the full text of those repealed rules (e.g., via the Ontario Government’s official legislation database).
3. Review the context, purpose, and scope of the repealed provision.

📌 **Final Note**:  
This entry appears to be a **technical or formatting error** in a legal document listing. It does not represent an active regulation but rather a record of legislative changes (repeals). For accurate regulatory summaries, refer to the official Ontario legislation database (e.g., [www.ontario.ca/laws](https://www.ontario.ca/laws)) and search for the specific SOR numbers and sections.
