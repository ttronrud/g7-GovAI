**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation by Jeanne Sauvé, Governor General of Canada (1987)**

---

### **Title of the Proclamation**  
*Proclamation Designating the Republic of Botswana as a Designated State under the Visiting Forces Act*

---

### **Date of Issuance**  
September 10, 1987  
(36th year of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign)

---

### **Issuing Authority**  
**Jeanne Sauvé**, Governor General of Canada, acting on the advice of the Privy Council for Canada.

---

### **Legal Basis**  
The proclamation is grounded in **Section 4 of the Visiting Forces Act**, which is part of the *Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970* (Chapter V-6). This section grants the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting through the Governor General) the authority to:

1. Designate any country as a "designated state" for the purposes of the Act; and  
2. Declare the extent to which the Act applies in that country.

### **Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

#### 1. **Designation of Botswana**  
The Republic of Botswana is officially designated as a **designated state** under the Visiting Forces Act. This means that the Act will apply to the operations, presence, and activities of foreign military forces visiting Botswana — subject to specific limitations.

#### 2. **Scope of Applicability**  
The Visiting Forces Act is declared to apply in Botswana **with the exception of Part VI** of the Act.

- **What is included (applicable):**  
  All provisions of the Act **except Part VI** will govern the legal status, rights, obligations, and responsibilities of foreign military personnel and forces visiting Botswana. This includes matters such as:
  - The rights and duties of visiting forces regarding land use, security, and conduct.
  - The conditions under which foreign forces may be stationed or operate temporarily.
  - Rules governing the movement, accommodation, and conduct of military personnel.

- **What is excluded (not applicable):**  
  **Part VI** of the Visiting Forces Act — which typically deals with **military personnel in the context of national defense, internal security, or military operations involving Canadian forces** — is **not extended to Botswana**.  
  This exclusion is significant because it indicates that the Act does not cover issues such as:
  - Canadian forces operating in Botswana.
  - Any military cooperation or defense agreements between Canada and Botswana.
  - The application of Canadian laws to foreign forces in matters of national security or internal control.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale (Policy Context)**  
The government stated that it was "expedient" to designate Botswana under the Act. This suggests that:

- Canada recognized the need for a legal framework to manage the presence of foreign military forces in Botswana.
- The designation supports Canada’s diplomatic and security interests by providing clarity on the legal status of visiting forces.
- The exclusion of Part VI reflects a pragmatic approach — ensuring that the Act does not impose obligations or restrictions that are inappropriate or inconsistent with the nature of Botswana’s sovereignty and its international relations.

---

### **Legal Effect and Obligations**  
- The proclamation is **binding on all persons and entities** affected by the Visiting Forces Act.
- All Canadian authorities, foreign governments, and relevant stakeholders are required to **take notice** and **govern themselves accordingly**.
- The proclamation is formalized by the **Great Seal of Canada**, making it a legally enforceable instrument.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Diplomatic and Security Engagement**  
   The designation reflects Canada’s engagement with Botswana in the realm of international military cooperation and mutual defense arrangements.

2. **Legal Clarity for Foreign Forces**  
   It provides a clear legal basis for foreign military forces visiting Botswana, outlining their rights and responsibilities under Canadian law — particularly in areas such as land use, security, and conduct.

3. **Sovereignty Consideration**  
   The exclusion of Part VI acknowledges that Botswana, as a sovereign nation, may have different legal and security frameworks than those applicable in Canada or other jurisdictions where the full Act applies.

4. **Historical Context**  
   This proclamation was issued in **1987**, during a period of growing international engagement and multilateral military cooperation. Botswana, as a stable and democratic nation in Southern Africa, was a strategic partner in regional peace and security efforts. Canada’s involvement in such frameworks through this Act reflects its role in supporting regional stability.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This proclamation is a formal, legally binding decision by the Canadian government to extend certain provisions of the *Visiting Forces Act* to the Republic of Botswana, while excluding the more sensitive and security-focused Part VI. It establishes a clear legal framework for the temporary presence of foreign military forces in Botswana, promoting transparency, predictability, and mutual respect in international military engagement.

It is a key example of how Canada uses domestic legislation to manage foreign military presence in a diplomatic and legally sound manner, balancing national interests with international obligations.
