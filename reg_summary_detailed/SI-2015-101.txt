- **Legal Basis**: The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.
  - This provision permits the transfer of control and supervision of certain federal public administration functions between different ministerial departments, provided such a transfer is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the Act.

#### **2. Subject of the Transfer**
- **Entity Transferred**: The **Canada Post Corporation Strategic Review Secretariat**.
- **Location within the Department**: This secretariat is a component of the **Department of Transport**.
- **Nature of the Function**: The Secretariat is responsible for conducting a strategic review of the Canada Post Corporation — a federal Crown corporation that provides postal services across Canada. The review likely involves assessing its long-term viability, operational efficiency, governance structure, and potential for restructuring or transformation.

#### **3. Transfer of Control and Supervision**
- The **control and supervision** of the Canada Post Corporation Strategic Review Secretariat are being transferred from:
  - The **Minister of Transport**
- To:
  - The **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**
- This means that the new minister will now have responsibility for:
  - Oversight of the strategic review process.
  - Management of the Secretariat’s operations, including staffing, budget, and reporting.
  - Ensuring alignment of the review with broader government priorities related to public services and infrastructure.

#### **4. Effective Date**
- The transfer becomes effective on **November 4, 2015**.
- This date marks the point at which the new minister assumes responsibility and the previous minister (of Transport) relinquishes oversight of the Secretariat.

#### **5. Purpose and Rationale (Implied)**
- The transfer reflects a **restructuring of responsibilities** within the federal government to align public service functions with broader government priorities.
- The **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** is typically responsible for managing federal Crown corporations, public infrastructure, and government efficiency initiatives.
- By transferring the strategic review of Canada Post to this minister, the government signals a shift in focus toward:
  - Assessing the long-term sustainability of federal Crown corporations.
  - Ensuring accountability and efficiency in public service delivery.
  - Potentially preparing the groundwork for future decisions on the future of Canada Post (e.g., privatization, restructuring, or integration into other services).

#### **6. Legal and Administrative Significance**
- This regulation is a **formal administrative reorganization** under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
- It does not alter the legal status or ownership of the Canada Post Corporation itself — only the **administrative oversight** of its strategic review process.
- The transfer is not a dissolution or termination of the Secretariat, but rather a change in ministerial responsibility.

#### **7. Contextual Background**
- This transfer occurred in the context of broader government efforts in the mid-2010s to:
  - Review and restructure federal Crown corporations.
  - Improve public service efficiency and reduce duplication.
  - Address fiscal challenges and modernize legacy institutions like Canada Post.
- The strategic review may have led to recommendations that eventually influenced future policy decisions, such as the eventual 2018 decision to restructure Canada Post into a more modern, service-focused entity.
