**Detailed Summary of the Glass Doors and Enclosures Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Glass Doors and Enclosures Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, establish mandatory safety requirements for specific types of glass doors and enclosures intended for **domestic use** in Canada. These regulations ensure that glass components in certain doors and enclosures meet defined safety standards to prevent injury, particularly from breakage, which could result in sharp fragments or failure to withstand impact or thermal stress.

The regulations were introduced to protect consumers by requiring the use of **safety glass** in specific glass-containing products, and they apply to both Canadian-manufactured and imported products.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Glass Door or Enclosure**  
   Refers to the following products when used for domestic purposes:
   - A **bathtub or shower door or enclosure** made of glass or containing a pane of glass.
   - A **storm door** made of glass or containing a pane of glass.
   - An **exterior door** (not a storm door) that:
     - Contains a glass pane with an area **greater than 0.5 m²**, and  
     - Has its **lowest edge less than 900 mm** from the bottom edge of the door.

   *Purpose*: This definition ensures that only high-risk glass installations—particularly those exposed to weather, impact, or high thermal loads—are subject to strict safety requirements.

2. **Laminated Glass**  
   Glass formed by bonding two or more glass sheets with one or more layers of plastic (e.g., polyvinyl butyral – PVB).  
   *Key feature*: When broken, it holds together due to the plastic layer, reducing risk of sharp shards.

3. **Responsible Person**  
   - For **Canadian-manufactured** glass doors or enclosures: the **manufacturer**.  
   - For **imported** glass doors or enclosures: the **importer**.  
   *Purpose*: Establishes accountability for ensuring compliance with safety standards.

4. **Safety Glass**  
   Glass that meets one of the following criteria:
   - Laminated
   - Tempered
   - Wired  
   *Note*: All safety glass must comply with specified standards.

5. **Safety Glass Standard**  
   Refers to **CAN/CGSB-12.1-M90** – *Tempered or Laminated Safety Glass*, published in November 1990.  
   *This standard defines the minimum performance requirements for safety glass in terms of durability and fracture resistance.*

6. **Tempered Glass**  
   Glass treated chemically or thermally so that upon breaking, it shatters into **small, granular pieces** rather than large, dangerous shards.  
   *Reduces injury risk during breakage.*

7. **Wired Glass**  
   Glass with a **wire mesh embedded** within it. The wire helps hold the glass together during breakage.  
   *Used in specific applications where laminated or tempered glass may not be feasible.*

8. **Wired Safety Glass Standard**  
   Refers to **CAN/CGSB-12.11-M90** – *Wired Safety Glass*, also published in November 1990.  
   *Sets specific performance criteria for wired glass, including resistance to impact and crack propagation.*

### **Safety Requirements for Glass in Doors and Enclosures**

The glass in any glass door or enclosure **must be safety glass** that meets the requirements outlined in the following table:

| Test | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Boiling Water Test** (from paragraph 7.2.2 of CAN/CGSB-12.1-M90) | No bubbles or defects shall develop beyond **12 mm** from the outer edge of the glass or from any crack that forms during testing. This test evaluates resistance to thermal stress (e.g., sudden temperature changes). |
| **Impact Test** (from paragraph 7.2.3 of CAN/CGSB-12.1-M90) | - No opening shall occur that would allow a **75 mm diameter steel sphere** to pass freely through the glass. <br> - The glass adjacent to any crack originating from the impact zone must be **held in place by reinforcing material** (e.g., laminated layer or wire mesh). <br> - Small fragments from both sides of the test piece may detach at or near the point of impact, but **no piece shall loosen or detach from any other part** of the glass. This ensures structural integrity and prevents dangerous free-floating shards. |

> ⚠️ *Note*: These tests are performed under standardized laboratory conditions to simulate real-world scenarios involving thermal shock or physical impact.

### **Documentation and Recordkeeping Obligations**

The **responsible person** (manufacturer or importer) must:

1. **Prepare and maintain records** demonstrating that each glass door or enclosure:
   - Uses safety glass that meets the applicable standard.
   - Passes the required tests (boiling water and impact).
   - Complies with all other provisions of these Regulations.

2. **Retain these records for at least four years**:
   - From the **date of manufacture** in Canada, or
   - From the **date of importation** into Canada.

3. **Provide documents to inspectors upon request**:
   - Must respond within **15 days** of receiving a written request from a Canadian Consumer Product Safety Directorate (CPSC) inspector.
   - Documents may include test reports, certifications, material specifications, and compliance records.

> *Purpose*: Ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability in the supply chain, enabling enforcement and recall if necessary.

### **Effective Date**

These Regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.  
(S.C. 2010, c. 21 – Registration date is typically published in the official gazette.)

---

### **Repeal Clause**

The regulation includes a **[Repeal]** clause indicating that it replaces or supersedes any previous regulations on the same topic. This ensures legal clarity and prevents outdated or conflicting rules from being applied.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Consumer Safety** | Prevents injuries from broken glass, especially in high-risk areas like bathrooms (shower enclosures) and exterior doors. |
| **Product Standardization** | Enforces consistent, tested performance across all glass used in these products. |
| **Accountability** | Places clear responsibility on manufacturers and importers to verify compliance. |
| **Enforceability** | Provides a clear audit trail through documentation, enabling inspections and recalls. |

---

### **Examples of Covered Products**

- **Bathroom doors** (shower or bathtub enclosures)
- **Storm doors** (with glass panes)
- **Exterior doors** with large glass areas (>0.5 m²) and low edges (<900 mm from floor)

> *Note*: A standard interior door with a small glass pane (e.g., 0.3 m²) is not covered, as it does not meet the area or height threshold.

### **Conclusion**

The *Glass Doors and Enclosures Regulations* are a critical component of Canada’s consumer product safety framework. By mandating the use of **safety glass** (laminated, tempered, or wired) and requiring rigorous testing under defined standards, the regulations significantly reduce the risk of injury from glass breakage. The requirement for documentation and recordkeeping ensures that compliance is verifiable and enforceable, providing both protection for consumers and a clear path for regulatory oversight.

These regulations reflect a proactive approach to product safety, aligning with international best practices and protecting vulnerable users—particularly children and elderly individuals—by minimizing the hazards associated with glass in everyday domestic environments.
