### **Detailed Summary of the Specialized Financing (Life Companies) Regulations**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act), specifically govern the activities of **life insurance companies** in engaging in **specialized financing** — that is, financing activities involving the acquisition of control or substantial investments in other entities — with strict limits to ensure financial stability, risk containment, and regulatory oversight.

The regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **sections 494a, 501a, and 1021b** of the *Insurance Companies Act*. They were introduced in **S.C. 2001, c. 9**, under sections 426 and 465, and are rooted in the broader regulatory framework established in **S.C. 1991, c. 47**.

## **I. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and central to the interpretation of the regulations:

1. **Act**: Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*.
2. **Balance sheet value**: The value reported on an entity’s balance sheet on an **unconsolidated basis** for shares and ownership interests. This is the primary metric used to assess exposure and risk.
3. **Book value** (repealed): Previously defined but **repealed by SOR/2008-168, s. 15**, so it no longer applies.
4. **Specialized financing entity of the life company**:  
   - An entity that is **controlled by the life company** or in which the life company holds a **substantial investment**.  
   - For regulatory purposes, it is defined more broadly as an entity that **acquires or holds shares or ownership interests** in entities that a life company may acquire control of or increase its investment in under subsection **493(4)** of the Act.
5. **Subsidiary (of a life company)**:  
   - Does **not** include a specialized financing entity of the life company.  
   - This distinction ensures that specialized financing entities are treated separately from traditional subsidiaries.

> **Note**: The definition of "specialized financing entity" is tailored to the specific context of subsection 490(1) of the Act, emphasizing the chain of control and investment that may lead to financial risk.

## **II. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:

- **Specialized financing activities** under **subsection 493(4)** of the Act.
- The **ownership** by a life company of shares or ownership interests in a **specialized financing entity** under **paragraph 495(2)(b)** of the Act.

Thus, the rules apply when a life company:
- Acquires control of, or increases a substantial investment in, another entity through specialized financing.
- Owns or holds a significant interest in a specialized financing entity.

---

## **III. Prohibited Activities**

A life company **shall not**, by way of specialized financing activities:

### **1. Acquire control of, or hold, acquire or increase a substantial investment in:**

- Any entity listed in **paragraphs 495(1)(a) to (j)** of the Act (e.g., entities involved in insurance, reinsurance, or certain financial services).
- An entity **primarily engaged in**:
  - Leasing motor vehicles in Canada **for the purpose of extending credit** or financing a customer’s purchase.
  - Providing **temporary possession of personal property** (including motor vehicles) for purposes **other than financing** the acquisition.
  - Acting as an **insurance broker or agent** in Canada.

> These restrictions prevent life companies from engaging in activities that are inherently risky or outside their core business (such as vehicle leasing or brokering), which could expose them to credit, operational, or reputational risks.

---

## **IV. Holding Period Limitations**

- A life company **shall not** hold control of, or make a substantial investment in, an entity through specialized financing activities for **more than 13 consecutive years**.

> This prevents long-term exposure to entities that may become obsolete, unprofitable, or subject to systemic risk.

> **Exception**: A period before a specialized financing entity becomes a specialized financing entity of the life company **shall not count** toward this 13-year limit.

---

## **V. Capital Exposure Limits**

These are **key risk-based thresholds** designed to protect the life company’s regulatory capital and ensure prudent risk management.

### **A. Aggregate Balance Sheet Value Limit**

A life company shall not acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in, an entity if the **aggregate balance sheet value** of the shares and ownership interests held (or to be held) by:
- The life company,
- Any of its subsidiaries,
- And any specialized financing entity of the life company,

in that entity **exceeds $250 million**.

> This cap limits the total exposure to any single entity, preventing overconcentration of risk.

---

### **B. 10% Regulatory Capital Threshold**

A life company shall not engage in such activities if the **sum** of the following exceeds **10% of the life company’s regulatory capital**:

1. The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests the life company and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity.
2. The **aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the life company and its subsidiaries to the specialized financing entities of the life company.
3. The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by the life company and its subsidiaries in:
   - Specialized financing entities of the life company,
   - Entities controlled by the life company via specialized financing,
   - Entities in which the life company holds a substantial investment via specialized financing.

> This ensures that specialized financing activities do not significantly erode the life company’s capital base.

---

### **C. 25% Regulatory Capital Threshold (for entities controlled by or invested in by specialized financing entities)**

A life company shall not acquire control of, or hold a substantial investment in, an entity **controlled by a specialized financing entity** of the life company, or in which that entity holds a substantial investment, if the sum of the following **exceeds or would exceed 25% of the life company’s regulatory capital**:

1. The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by:
   - The life company and its subsidiaries,
   - In the specialized financing entity,
   - In entities controlled by that entity,
   - In entities in which that entity holds a substantial investment.
2. The **aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the life company and its subsidiaries to:
   - The specialized financing entity,
   - Entities controlled by it,
   - Entities in which it holds a substantial investment.

> This is a **more stringent limit** than the 10% rule and applies to **nested or layered exposures** through specialized financing entities, reflecting higher risk due to complexity and opacity.

---

### **D. 25% Regulatory Capital Threshold (for direct investments in non-specialized entities)**

A life company shall not acquire control of, or hold a substantial investment in, an entity (other than through a specialized financing entity controlled by the life company) if the sum of the following exceeds **25% of the life company’s regulatory capital**:

1. The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests the life company and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity.
2. The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held in:
   - Entities controlled by the life company via specialized financing,
   - Entities in which the life company holds a substantial investment via specialized financing,
   - **Excluding** those acquired via a specialized financing entity.
3. The **aggregate value of outstanding loans** made to:
   - Entities controlled by the life company via specialized financing,
   - Entities in which the life company holds a substantial investment via specialized financing,
   - **Excluding** those made via a specialized financing entity.

> This rule applies to **direct investments** outside the specialized financing chain and ensures that even indirect exposure does not push the company beyond a critical capital threshold.

---

## **VI. Additional Restrictions on Specialized Financing Entities**

A life company shall not acquire or hold control of, or increase a substantial investment in, a **specialized financing entity** if:

### **1. Debt-to-Asset Ratio Exceeds Threshold**

The **value of outstanding debt obligations** (excluding those payable to the life company or entities controlled by it) of:
- The specialized financing entity, and
- Any specialized financing entity it controls,

**exceeds twice** the value of the sum of:
- The **excess of assets over liabilities** (i.e., equity) of the specialized financing entity (on an unconsolidated basis), and
- The **non-controlling interests** (i.e., equity held by third parties) in the specialized financing entity (on a consolidated basis).

> This ensures that specialized financing entities do not carry excessive leverage, which could lead to insolvency or systemic risk.

---

### **2. Control or Investment in Prohibited Entities**

The specialized financing entity **must not** control or hold ownership interests in any of the following:
- Entities referred to in **paragraphs 3(a) to (d)** (i.e., entities involved in leasing, temporary possession, or insurance brokering).

> Prevents the "downstream" involvement of specialized financing entities in prohibited activities.

---

### **3. $250 Million Balance Sheet Value Threshold**

The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests (excluding those held by the specialized financing entity in another specialized financing entity it controls) that the life company, the
