## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Canada–New Zealand Convention on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Income Tax**

  - **Order in Council P.C. 2016-375 (May 20, 2016)**, which authorized the issuance of a proclamation.

### 📚 **3. Definitions and Interpretation**
Key definitions clarify how the Convention operates:

### 🏠 **4. Residency Rules**
Determining whether a person is a resident is critical for tax jurisdiction.

#### For **Individuals**:
An individual is **not a resident** of a country if they are taxed **only on income from sources within that country**.

If an individual is a **resident of both countries**, their status is determined in this order:

1. **Permanent Home**  
   → Resident only in the country where a **permanent home** is available.  
   → If available in both, resident in the country with **closer personal and economic ties** (i.e., **centre of vital interests**).

2. **Centre of Vital Interests**  
   → If undetermined, resident in the country where the individual has an **habitual abode**.

3. **Habitual Abode**  
   → If in both or neither, resident in the country of **nationality**.

4. **Nationality Tie**  
   → If national of both or neither, the **competent authorities** must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

#### For **Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, trusts)**:
- If a person (non-individual) is a resident of both countries, the **competent authorities** must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.
- Factors considered: place of **effective management**, **incorporation**, and other relevant circumstances.
- **No tax relief** can be claimed if no agreement is reached.

> ✅ **Purpose**: Prevents double taxation by clearly defining where a taxpayer is "at home" for tax purposes.

### 🏭 **5. Permanent Establishment (PE) – Key Concept**
A **permanent establishment** is a **fixed place of business** through which an enterprise conducts business.

#### Included Examples:
- Place of management  
- Branch  
- Office  
- Factory  
- Workshop  
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry  
- Any place related to exploration or exploitation of natural resources  

#### Special Rule – Building/Construction Projects:
- A **building site, construction, installation, or assembly project** constitutes a PE **if it lasts more than 12 months**.

#### Criteria for a PE:
An enterprise is deemed to have a PE in a Contracting State if, **in any 12-month period**, it:
1. Carries out activities related to the **exploration or exploitation of natural resources** (including standing timber) in that country; **or**
2. Operates **substantial equipment** in that country.

> 🔍 Example: A Canadian mining company operating a drilling site in New Zealand for over 183 days would have a PE in NZ.

### 🚨 **6. Exception: Services Performed by Individuals**
Even without a physical presence, certain **services performed by individuals** may constitute a PE:

- If an individual is present in the other country for **more than 183 days in any 12-month period**, and:
  - More than **50% of gross revenues** from active business activities are derived from services performed there, **through that individual**; **or**
  - Services are performed for the **same or connected projects** by one or more individuals present in the country.

> ⚠️ Exception: This rule **does not apply** to services limited to:
> - Storage, display, or delivery of goods  
> - Purchasing goods or collecting information  
> - Preparatory or auxiliary activities  
> - Activities that are only of a preparatory or auxiliary character

> 🔍 **Key Principle**: Services performed by an individual **do not count** as a PE unless the **enterprise supervises, directs, or controls** the work.

---

### 📏 **7. Aggregation of Activities (Associated Enterprises)**
When two enterprises are **associated** (one controls or is controlled by the other, or both are controlled by a third party), the **duration of activities** in a country is **aggregated**:
- Activities of associated enterprises are combined when connected.
- However, **any concurrent period** is counted only **once**.

> ✅ Example: A Canadian company and its subsidiary jointly operate a project in NZ — the total time in NZ is aggregated for PE determination.

---

### ❌ **8. Exclusions from Permanent Establishment**
The following **do not constitute** a PE:
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods.
- Maintenance of stock **solely for storage, display, or delivery**.
- Maintenance of stock **for processing by another enterprise**.
- Maintenance of a fixed place **only for purchasing or collecting information**.
- Maintenance of a place **only for preparatory or auxiliary activities**.

> ✅ Purpose: Prevents taxation on routine or non-operational activities.

---

### 🏢 **9. Agent Status Exception**
An enterprise **does not have a PE** simply because it uses:
- A **broker**, **general commission agent**, or **independent agent**.

> ✅ Exception: Only if the agent has **authority to conclude contracts** on behalf of the enterprise, or:
> - Manufactures or processes goods **in the other country** for the enterprise → then a PE is created.

> 🔍 Important: This rule protects legitimate business intermediaries from being taxed as if they were permanent offices.
