**Detailed Summary of the *Recovery of Overpayments Made to Former Members of Parliament Regulations***  
*(Made under the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, S.C. 1995, c. 30)*

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**
These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, pursuant to specific provisions in the **Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act (MPRA)**:

- **Paragraphs 64(1)(f)a, (h.1)b, (k)c, and (o)d** of the MPRA.
- The regulations are designed to establish a clear, structured process for recovering **overpayments** made to former Members of Parliament (MPs) under the Act.

The regulations came into force on **December 9, 1997**.  
*Note: The regulation was later repealed in part by SOR/2020-180, section 10 — this summary reflects the version in effect up to that repeal.*

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Interpretation**
- **"Act"** refers to the *Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act*.

---

### **3. Notice of Recovery**
When an overpayment is identified, the **Minister must send a formal notice** to the concerned former MP. This notice must:
- Specify:
  - The **amounts** referred to in:
    - **Section 56(3)** and **Section 63.1** of the Act (overpayments related to retirement allowances or supplementary benefits), or
    - The **amount of a reduction** under **subsection 59.1(6)** of the Act (a reduction in future benefits due to overpayment).
  - The **manner in which the amounts may be recovered**, including both lump-sum and monthly deduction options.

---

### **4. Election Period and Options for Recovery**
The recipient of the notice has **45 days** from the date of the notice to make an election on how to repay the overpayment. The options are:

#### **Option 1: Lump-Sum Payment**
- Pay the full amount in one payment.

#### **Option 2: Monthly Deductions**
The person may choose to repay the amount through **monthly deductions** from their current allowance or other benefits, depending on the type of overpayment:

##### **(a) For overpayments under Section 56(3)(b) or Section 63.1:**
- Monthly deductions must equal **10% of the aggregate of the gross monthly amounts payable** to the person under the Act **as of the date the notice is sent**.
- Repayments must be made over the **shorter of**:
  - The person’s **lifetime**, or
  - The period required to repay the total amount at 10% monthly deductions.

##### **(b) For overpayments under subsection 59.1(6):**
- Monthly deductions are calculated using **mortality rates** from the most recent actuarial valuation report laid before Parliament (as per subsection 65(1) of the Act).
- The deductions are to be paid with **interest at 4% per annum, compounded annually**.
- The repayment period is again the **shorter of**:
  - The person’s lifetime, or
  - The period required to repay at 10% of the gross monthly benefits (as defined above).

> *Note: The interest is applied only to the overpayment amount, not the monthly deduction itself.*

---

### **5. Consequences of No Election Within 45 Days**
If the former MP fails to make an election within the 45-day window:
- The **Minister is required to initiate monthly deductions** automatically, using the same rules as in subsection (2)(b), whichever applies based on the nature of the overpayment.

---

### **6. Flexibility in Repayment Plan**
A person who has elected to pay via monthly deductions may **later modify** the repayment plan at any time by:
- **Increasing** the monthly deduction amount, or
- **Paying a lump sum** and then repaying the remaining balance via monthly deductions, **within the same or a shorter period** than originally agreed.

This provides flexibility to address financial hardship or changes in circumstances.

---

### **7. Order of Recovery (Priority Sequence)**
When recovering overpayments, the Minister must follow a **specific order of priority**:

1. **Part I of the Act** (basic retirement allowances)
2. **Part IV of the Act** (supplementary benefits)
3. **Part II of the Act** (other allowances)
4. **Part III of the Act** (allowances under specific conditions)

This ensures that more fundamental benefits are addressed first before recovering from less essential or later-added benefits.

---

### **8. Financial Hardship Provisions**
If the monthly deductions under paragraph (2)(b) cause **financial hardship**, the **Minister may reduce the deduction amount**.
- However, the deduction **cannot be less than 5%** of the aggregate of the gross monthly benefits payable to the person under the Act as of the date the notice was issued.

This safeguard protects former MPs from undue financial strain.

---

### **9. Reconciliation and Adjustment Requirements**
The Minister is required to:
- Perform a **reconciliation** of the amount of reduction made under **subsection 59.1(5)** of the Act.
- Make **appropriate adjustments** (either recovery or refund) in the following situations:
  - Upon receipt of **notifications** specified in **paragraphs 59.1(3)(b) or (c)** of the Act (e.g., changes in benefit status or claims).
  - On **each anniversary date** referred to in subsection 59.1(5) of the Act.

> **Important Exception**:  
> The anniversary date under subsection 59.1(5) is **not changed** if the former MP:
> - Commences a **federal position**, or
> - Enters into a **federal service contract** within the **12 months following** that date.

This prevents a disruption in the recovery timeline due to a change in employment status.

---

### **10. Key Principles and Objectives**
- **Transparency**: Clear notice of overpayment and repayment options.
- **Fairness**: Protection against financial hardship through a minimum deduction floor (5%).
- **Accountability**: Structured repayment with interest (only on reductions under 59.1(6)).
- **Flexibility**: Options to adjust repayment plans over time.
- **Actuarial Integrity**: Use of official mortality rates for long-term benefit calculations.
- **Legal Compliance**: Adherence to the hierarchy of benefit types and statutory timelines.

---

### **11. Repeal Status**
- These regulations were **repealed by SOR/2020-180, section 10**.
- This means that the current version of the *Recovery of Overpayments Made to Former Members of Parliament Regulations* is **no longer in force** as of the date of repeal.
- The repeal likely reflects updates to the retirement benefits framework or the introduction of a new regulatory regime.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Recovery of Overpayments Made to Former Members of Parliament Regulations* established a **structured, fair, and legally grounded process** for recovering overpayments from former MPs. It balanced the need for fiscal accountability with protections for individuals facing financial hardship. While the regulations were instrumental in ensuring transparency and consistency in benefit recovery, they have now been **repealed**, indicating a shift in policy or administrative approach to managing retirement benefits and overpayments.
