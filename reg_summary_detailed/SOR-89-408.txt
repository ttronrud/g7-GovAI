### **Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under **Section 73 of the National Transportation Act, 1987** (R.S., c. 28 (3rd Supp.)). Section 73 empowers the Minister of Transport to issue exemptions from certain requirements of the Act when it is deemed necessary or advisable in the public interest.

Specifically, the Minister determines that **Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd.** (a Canadian airline) is **not qualified** to obtain a domestic air transport licence under **subparagraph 72(2)(a)(i)** of the National Transportation Act, 1987. This subparagraph typically requires that an applicant must meet specific eligibility criteria — such as having sufficient financial resources, operational experience, or technical qualifications — to be eligible for a licence.

Despite this lack of qualification, the Minister finds that granting a domestic licence to Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd. would serve the **public interest**. This justifies the exercise of the Minister’s discretion under Section 73 to **grant an exemption** from the requirement that the company meet the qualification standard in subparagraph 72(2)(a)(i).

### **Key Actions Taken by the Minister**

1. **Revocation of Prior Exemption:**  
   The Minister revokes the previous *Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd. Exemption Order, 1988*, issued on December 31, 1988. This earlier exemption was no longer valid or appropriate under the circumstances.

2. **Issuance of a New Exemption Order:**  
   In substitution for the revoked order, the Minister issues a **new exemption order** that grants Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd. an exemption from the application of **subparagraph 72(2)(a)(i)** of the National Transportation Act, 1987.

### **Core Provision of the New Order**

Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd. is **exempted from the requirement** under subparagraph 72(2)(a)(i) of the Act — meaning the company is not required to meet the qualification standards (such as financial or operational eligibility) that would normally be necessary for a domestic air transport licence.

This exemption allows the company to proceed with operations under the domestic licence framework, even though it does not fully satisfy the usual eligibility criteria.

### **Public Interest Justification**

The Minister explicitly states that the exemption is necessary or advisable **in the public interest**. This implies that:
- There are compelling reasons (such as regional connectivity, economic development, emergency services, or national transportation needs) that justify allowing an otherwise ineligible entity to operate.
- The benefits of Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd.’s operations outweigh the risks or regulatory concerns associated with its lack of qualification.

---

### **Legal and Regulatory Significance**

- This regulation demonstrates the **flexibility** of Canada’s aviation regulatory framework, allowing the Minister to override strict eligibility requirements when public interest demands it.
- It underscores the **duty of the Minister to act in the public interest**, even when an applicant does not meet formal criteria.
- The exemption is **temporary and conditional**, tied to the specific circumstances of the company and the regulatory framework.

---

### **Citation and Effect**

- The Order may be cited as: *Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd. Exemption Order, 1989*.
- It is published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, making it legally enforceable and accessible to the public.
- The Order is effective from the date of publication (August 9, 1989), unless otherwise specified.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation grants Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd. a formal exemption from a key qualification requirement (subparagraph 72(2)(a)(i)) of the National Transportation Act, 1987, despite the company's lack of formal eligibility. The decision is grounded in a public interest assessment and is authorized under Section 73 of the Act. It reflects a discretionary regulatory function aimed at ensuring that essential air services can be provided, even when standard criteria are not met.

This exemption is not a licence grant per se, but a **regulatory relief** enabling the company to operate under the domestic licence framework under specific conditions.
