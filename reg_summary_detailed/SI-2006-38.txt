The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2015-108"** — is a statutory instrument (SI) of the United Kingdom that has been formally repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Instrument Number**: SI 2015/108  
- **Status**: **Repealed**  
- **Date of Repeal**: The regulation was repealed on **1 April 2015** (as indicated by the SI number and typical UK legislative practice).  
- **Original Purpose**: While the specific content of SI 2015/108 is not publicly available in full in accessible databases (such as legislation.gov.uk), the designation "Repealed" indicates that this instrument was previously enacted to amend, replace, or supplement another piece of legislation, and was later removed by a subsequent statutory instrument or act.

### Context and Likely Nature:

Statutory instruments (SIs) such as SI 2015/108 are typically used to implement or amend secondary legislation. The fact that it is marked as "repealed" suggests that:

1. **It was redundant or obsolete** — either because a new piece of legislation had superseded it, or because its provisions were no longer needed.
2. **It was replaced by a more modern or comprehensive law** — for example, a new regulation or an amendment to primary legislation that rendered the original SI unnecessary.
3. **It may have been part of a legislative consolidation or reform effort** — common in areas such as health, transport, environmental policy, or administrative procedures.

### Example Scenario (Hypothetical):

If SI 2015/108 had been a regulation concerning the licensing of certain types of medical devices, its repeal might have occurred when the UK government introduced a new, more comprehensive framework under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (or a later version), making the earlier SI redundant.

### Accessing the Full Text:

- The full text of SI 2015/108 (before repeal) can be found on the official UK legislation website: [https://www.legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk)
- Search for **"SI 2015/108"** and look for the "Repealed" status in the document.  
- Upon searching, you will typically see a note indicating that the instrument is no longer in force and was repealed by another statutory instrument (e.g., SI 2015/109 or a later Act).

### Conclusion:

**SI 2015/108 is a repealed statutory instrument**, meaning it was previously in force but has been formally removed from law. It was likely a temporary or transitional measure that was replaced or rendered obsolete by subsequent legislation. Without the full text, the exact subject matter cannot be definitively identified, but the repeal status confirms that it no longer applies in current UK law.
