**Detailed Summary of the Exemptions from and Modifications to Hours of Work Provisions Regulations (S.C. 2018, c. 27, s. 446)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, made under the authority of the *Canada Labour Code* (Act), establishes **exemptions and modifications** to the hours of work provisions in **Division I of Part III** of the Code — specifically, those relating to rest periods, breaks, and work hour limits — for certain classes of employees in key industries. The primary purpose is to **balance worker protections with operational realities** in sectors where strict adherence to standard labor hours could unduly impair safety, efficiency, or service delivery.

The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, determined that applying the standard hours of work rules **without modification** to certain employee groups would be:
- **Unduly prejudicial to employee interests**, or  
- **Seriously detrimental to the operation** of industrial establishments.

Therefore, the regulation provides **sector-specific exemptions and tailored modifications** to the general hours of work rules, ensuring that essential workers in critical industries can perform their duties effectively while still maintaining reasonable protections.
