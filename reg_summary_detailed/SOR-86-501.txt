**Detailed Summary of the Pacific Salmon Commission Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulatory instrument, known as the *Pacific Salmon Commission Privileges and Immunities Order*, was issued by the Government of Canada on **January 28, 1985**, in response to the signing of the **Treaty between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America concerning Pacific Salmon**, which was signed on **January 28, 1985**. The treaty was formally ratified on **March 18, 1985**, by both governments.

The treaty established a cooperative framework for the management, conservation, and sustainable use of Pacific salmon populations that migrate between Canadian and U.S. waters—particularly in the Pacific Northwest region. A key mechanism under this treaty is the creation of the **Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC)**, as specified in **paragraph II(1)** of the treaty.

To enable the effective operation of the Commission within Canada, the Canadian government enacted this Order to grant the Commission and its representatives, officials, and experts specific **privileges and immunities** under Canadian law. These privileges are based on international norms and are derived from the **Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations (the "Convention")**, which provides a model framework for international organizations.

### **Legal Authority**

The Order is made under **Section 3 of the Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs and with the concurrence of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans) to grant privileges and immunities to international organizations operating in Canada.

This legislative authority enables Canada to recognize and support international bodies like the Pacific Salmon Commission by providing them with legal protections and operational freedoms necessary for fulfilling their mandate.

- These include:
  - **Immunity from civil and criminal liability** for acts performed during the course of their expert duties.

### **Purpose and Significance**

This Order serves several critical purposes:

1. **Facilitates International Cooperation**: It enables the Pacific Salmon Commission to function as a stable, legally recognized body that can manage shared salmon resources across national borders.

2. **Ensures Operational Independence**: By granting legal capacity and immunity, the Order protects the Commission from undue interference by Canadian authorities, allowing it to make science-based, impartial decisions.

3. **Promotes Scientific and Policy Collaboration**: The immunity of experts encourages participation from scientists and technical specialists, who might otherwise hesitate to engage due to legal risks.

4. **Supports Treaty Implementation**: As a foundational element of the Canada–U.S. Pacific Salmon Treaty, this Order provides the necessary legal infrastructure to implement joint management of salmon stocks.

5. **Aligns with International Standards**: By referencing the UN Convention, the Order ensures that the Commission’s status is consistent with international norms and best practices for intergovernmental organizations.
