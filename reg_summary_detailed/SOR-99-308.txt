**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Expropriation Act*, serves to **repeal an outdated Order in Council** and to **establish a new, updated tariff for the compensation of costs incurred by objectors during expropriation proceedings**. Below is a comprehensive and detailed breakdown of the regulation:

---

### 1. **Legal Authority and Issuance**
- **Issuing Body**: His Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation**: Made jointly by:
  - The Minister of Public Works and Government Services
  - The Treasury Board
- **Legal Basis**: Pursuant to **subsection 10(9) of the Expropriation Act**.
- **Purpose**: To modernize and clarify the cost-reimbursement framework for individuals or entities who object to government expropriation actions.

---

### 2. **Repeal of Prior Order**
- The regulation **repeals Order in Council P.C. 1980-3/2414**, which was issued on **September 5, 1980**.
- This prior order is declared **outdated or no longer applicable**, likely due to changes in legal standards, inflation, or administrative efficiency.
- The repeal ensures that the current, more equitable and transparent cost tariff is now in force, replacing the 1980 version.

### 3. **Prescription of the Tariff of Costs**
A new **Tariff of Costs** is established, which sets **maximum allowable reimbursement amounts** for specific expenses incurred by an objector (a person or entity who objects to an expropriation) during a hearing.

The tariff specifies the following **maximum daily and itemized cost allowances**:

| Expense Type | Maximum Amount per Day | Description |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Counsel Attendance** | $600 | For each day that legal counsel representing the objector is reasonably required to attend the hearing. This covers the time and fees of legal representation. |
| **Objector’s Accommodation and Travel** | $140 | For each day the objector (the individual or entity) is reasonably required to attend the hearing. Covers reasonable expenses such as lodging, meals, and transportation. |
| **Written or Prepared Materials** | $200 | For the actual and reasonable costs of written or prepared materials (e.g., documents, reports, affidavits, submissions) used by the objector or their counsel in asserting the objection at the hearing. |

> ⚠️ **Important Notes**:
> - These amounts are **maximums**. The actual reimbursement will be based on **reasonable and justifiable expenses**.
> - The costs must be **reasonably required** and **directly related** to the objector’s participation in the hearing.
> - The amounts are **per day** and are **cumulative** across the duration of the hearing.

### 4. **Application and Effective Date**
- The new Tariff **comes into force on the day it is officially registered** in the Canada Gazette or other official publication.
- Registration ensures that the tariff is legally binding and enforceable in all future expropriation proceedings where this regulation applies.

### 5. **Purpose and Significance**
This regulation:
- Ensures **fairness and consistency** in the financial support provided to objectors.
- Provides **clear, transparent guidelines** for both objectors and government officials on what expenses may be reimbursed.
- Updates cost allowances to reflect **current economic conditions** (as the 1980 tariff is now outdated).
- Promotes **access to justice** by reducing financial barriers for individuals and organizations who object to land or property expropriation.
- Aligns with the principles of the *Expropriation Act*, which aims to balance public interest with the rights of property owners and affected parties.

### 6. **Key Principles Underlying the Tariff**
- **Reasonableness**: Expenses must be reasonable and directly related to the hearing.
- **Proportionality**: The daily caps are designed to cover typical costs without allowing excessive claims.
- **Clarity and Predictability**: Objectors and legal representatives can plan their participation with certainty regarding financial obligations and potential reimbursements.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: The Treasury Board and Minister of Public Works and Government Services have ensured the tariff is practical and cost-effective to administer.

### Conclusion
This regulation represents a significant update to the cost-reimbursement framework for expropriation hearings in Canada. By repealing the 1980 order and introducing a modern, fair, and transparent tariff, it strengthens the fairness, accountability, and accessibility of the expropriation process. It ensures that objectors are not unduly burdened financially while maintaining fiscal responsibility for the government.

It is a key component of the broader legal and administrative framework governing land acquisition and property rights in Canada.
