**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Tender Fruit Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Ontario Tender Fruit Order* (C.R.C., c. 219) is a regulatory instrument enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, under **Section 2 of the Farm Products Marketing Act (Ontario)**. This Order serves to **revoke two previous regulations**:

- The *Ontario Fresh Fruit Order*, C.R.C., c. 187  
- The *Ontario Tender Fruit-for-Processing Order*, C.R.C., c. 219  

and replaces them with a **new, consolidated Order** that establishes a unified framework for regulating the **marketing of tender fruit in Ontario**, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

This new Order is formally titled the **Ontario Tender Fruit Order** and provides the legal authority and structure for managing the marketing of tender fruit through a designated board and a comprehensive plan.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* — the foundational legislation that empowers the regulatory bodies to oversee the marketing of agricultural commodities, including tender fruit.

2. **Board**  
   The *Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario*, established under the Act. It has broad authority to regulate the marketing of tender fruit both within Ontario and in interprovincial and export trade.

3. **Commodity Board**  
   The *Ontario Tender Fruit Producers’ Marketing Board*, also established under the Act. This body is specifically focused on tender fruit and has specialized powers related to pricing, levies, and market stabilization.

4. **Plan**  
   A formal marketing plan developed and amended over time under the Farm Products Marketing Act. The Plan includes strategies for the marketing of tender fruit and may be supplemented by regulations that implement its provisions.

5. **Processing**  
   Defined broadly to include:
   - Manufacturing products or juice, beverages, spirits, or wine from tender fruit
   - Specific physical transformations such as canning, bottling, distilling, fermenting, dehydrating, pitting, drying, or freezing  
   This definition ensures that all stages of post-harvest transformation of tender fruit are covered under the regulatory framework.

6. **Tender Fruit**  
   Specifically defined as:
   - Peaches  
   - Pears  
   - Plums  
   - Sour cherries  
   - Sweet cherries  
   These fruits must be **produced in Ontario** to qualify under the Order.

### **Regulatory Authority and Powers**

#### **1. Joint Authority of the Board and Commodity Board**
Both the **Farm Products Marketing Board (Board)** and the **Ontario Tender Fruit Producers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** are authorized to regulate the marketing of tender fruit in:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales outside of Ontario)

For these purposes, they may exercise **all or any powers** that they currently have under the Act and the Plan **with respect to persons and property located within Ontario**. This includes powers related to pricing, market access, quality standards, and market stabilization — both locally and in broader markets.

#### **2. Powers of the Commodity Board (Specific to Levies and Charges)**

The Commodity Board has specific, detailed powers to manage financial aspects of the tender fruit marketing system:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges**:
  - Can set fees on individuals or entities engaged in **production or marketing** of tender fruit within Ontario.
  - These levies can be applied differently depending on the **type of producer or marketer**, based on classification into groups.

- **Classification of producers**:
  - The Commodity Board may classify producers into different groups (e.g., small farms, large producers, processors, exporters).
  - Each group may be subject to **different levy amounts**, allowing for equitable and flexible financial arrangements.

- **Collection of levies**:
  - The levies or charges must be collected from producers and marketers operating in Ontario.

- **Use of levies and charges**:
  The funds collected are to be used for:
  - Operational expenses of the Commodity Board and the Board
  - Creation of **reserves** (financial buffers)
  - Compensation for **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of tender fruit
  - **Equalization or adjustment** of income among producers  
    → This ensures that producers who may have had poor market outcomes (e.g., low prices, poor demand) are compensated, while those who performed well can help stabilize the system.

  The adjustment mechanism allows for **periodic redistribution of revenues** from sales of tender fruit across producers to promote fairness and market stability.

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Regulation**

The primary goals of the *Ontario Tender Fruit Order* are:

1. **Market Stability**  
   To prevent price volatility and ensure consistent returns for producers by stabilizing supply and demand through coordinated marketing.

2. **Fair Distribution of Revenue**  
   To ensure that producers, especially those in less favorable market positions, are not unfairly burdened by market fluctuations.

3. **Support for Producers**  
   To provide financial safeguards (e.g., reserves, loss compensation) and promote equitable participation in interprovincial and export markets.

4. **Efficient Management of Processing and Trade**  
   To regulate both the **marketing and processing** of tender fruit, ensuring that value-added products are developed and marketed in a structured, fair, and sustainable way.

5. **Replacement of Outdated Regulations**  
   To modernize and consolidate previous, fragmented rules (the Fresh Fruit Order and Tender Fruit-for-Processing Order) into a single, clear, and effective regulatory framework.

### **Legal Basis and Enforcement**

- The Order is made under **Section 2 of the Farm Products Marketing Act**, which grants the Minister and the Governor General the authority to create or revoke marketing orders.
- The Commodity Board and the Board operate under the **Plan** and any regulations made under the Act to implement that Plan.
- Enforcement is carried out through the regulatory powers of the Boards, including the ability to issue orders, impose charges, and manage financial mechanisms.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Modernization**: Replaces outdated and possibly overlapping rules with a more coherent, focused regulation.
- **Producer Equity**: Introduces a mechanism for income equalization, which helps protect small or vulnerable producers from market shocks.
- **Economic Resilience**: Builds financial buffers and loss compensation systems to improve the long-term sustainability of tender fruit production in Ontario.
- **Export and Interprovincial Trade Readiness**: Provides a clear regulatory pathway for Ontario producers to participate in national and international markets.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Tender Fruit Order* establishes a comprehensive, equitable, and forward-looking regulatory framework for the marketing of tender fruit in Ontario. By revoking older, fragmented regulations and consolidating authority under a single, clearly defined structure, it enhances market stability, supports producer fairness, and strengthens the economic viability of Ontario’s tender fruit industry — particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

It reflects a balance between **market efficiency** and **producer protection**, ensuring that both the needs of the industry and the interests of farmers are met through structured, transparent, and accountable governance.
