**Detailed Summary of the Factoring Entity Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Enactment**

The *Factoring Entity Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of four key Canadian financial regulatory statutes:

- **Section 978a of the Bank Act**
- **Section 463 of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act**
- **Section 1021 of the Insurance Companies Act**
- **Section 531 of the Trust and Loan Companies Act**

These statutory authorities empower the government to define and regulate entities engaged in factoring activities—specifically, those that provide financing based on accounts receivable.

The regulations were formally published in **Statutes of Canada, 2001, Chapter 9**, under the following sections:
- Section 183 (Regulatory enactment)
- Section 339 (Cooperative Credit Associations Act)
- Section 465 (Trust and Loan Companies Act)
- Section 569 (Insurance Companies Act)

They are referenced in earlier statutes from **1991** (Chapters 45–48), indicating a long-standing regulatory framework that has been updated to reflect modern financial practices.

### **2. Purpose and Scope**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **clarify and define the term "factoring entity"** for use in several financial legislation acts. This definition is critical for determining which financial institutions or entities fall under specific regulatory oversight related to factoring activities.

#### **Definition of "Factoring Entity"**

A **factoring entity** is defined as:

> *"An entity whose activities are limited to acting as a factor in respect of accounts receivable."*

This means that the entity’s **core business function** must be limited to providing financing to businesses based on their outstanding accounts receivable (i.e., money owed by customers).

#### **Key Activities Included in the Definition**

The definition explicitly includes two essential activities:
1. **Raising money for the purpose of acting as a factor**  
   – This includes securing capital (e.g., through loans or lines of credit) specifically to engage in factoring operations.
2. **Lending money while acting as a factor**  
   – The entity may lend funds to the seller (the original business) to enable it to receive immediate cash flow, typically in exchange for a percentage of the receivables or a fixed fee.

Importantly, the definition emphasizes **activity limitation**: the entity must not engage in other financial services or business operations. Its sole or primary function must be factoring.

### **3. Regulatory Context and Application**

The definition of "factoring entity" applies in the following legal provisions:

| Legislation | Relevant Section(s) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Bank Act** | Subsection 464(1) and subparagraph 522.22(1)(b)(i) |
| **Cooperative Credit Associations Act** | Subsection 386(1) |
| **Insurance Companies Act** | Subsection 490(1) |
| **Trust and Loan Companies Act** | Subsection 449(1) |

These provisions are used to determine:
- Whether a financial institution or entity is subject to regulatory oversight.
- Whether it qualifies as a "factoring entity" under the law.
- Whether it falls under specific rules related to transparency, consumer protection, or capital adequacy.

By defining "factoring entity," the regulations ensure consistency in how such entities are identified and regulated across different financial sectors.

### **4. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the day that the following provisions of the **Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (FCACA)** are enacted:

- **Section 127** – Bank Act (amendment)
- **Section 132** – Cooperative Credit Associations Act (amendment)
- **Section 314** – Insurance Companies Act (amendment)
- **Section 426** – Trust and Loan Companies Act (amendment)
- **Section 550** – Bank Act (amendment)

These amendments were enacted under **Chapter 9 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001**.

Thus, the Factoring Entity Regulations **take effect on the date when these amendments become effective**, which was **October 24, 2001**, as noted in the official notice.

### **5. Significance and Implications**

- **Regulatory Clarity**: Provides a clear, legally binding definition of what constitutes a factoring entity, reducing ambiguity in financial supervision.
- **Targeted Oversight**: Enables regulators to focus oversight on entities whose sole business is factoring, rather than broad financial institutions.
- **Consumer Protection**: Helps ensure that factoring activities—especially those involving credit extensions or fees—are transparent and fair, especially when dealing with small businesses.
- **Consistency Across Sectors**: Harmonizes treatment of factoring across banking, insurance, cooperative credit, and trust/loan companies.
- **Compliance Framework**: Establishes a baseline for financial institutions to assess whether they meet the criteria of a factoring entity, which may affect licensing, reporting, or disclosure obligations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Factoring Entity Regulations* serve as a foundational regulatory tool that defines and limits the scope of factoring activities in Canada. By clearly delineating what constitutes a factoring entity—limited to factoring accounts receivable and involving the raising or lending of funds for that purpose—the regulations enhance regulatory precision, promote financial stability, and support fair practices in the marketplace. The regulations are effective from **October 24, 2001**, and are part of a broader effort to modernize financial regulation in response to evolving business models, particularly in small business financing.

**Key Takeaway**:  
A "factoring entity" is not a general financial institution but one whose *sole or primary activity* is to act as a factor—providing financing based on accounts receivable—through either raising capital or lending funds. This definition ensures regulatory focus and accountability in a specialized financial service.
