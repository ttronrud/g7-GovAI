### **Detailed Summary of the Cranbrook Airport Zoning Regulations (1987)**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Procedural Context**

The **Cranbrook Airport Zoning Regulations** were formally enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Section 4.4**, which allows the Minister of Transport to adopt zoning regulations for airports following a public consultation process.

- A **proposed version** of the regulations was published in two successive issues of:
  - *Canada Gazette, Part I* (August 22 and 29, 1987)
  - *Cranbrook Daily Townsman* (June 22 and 23, 1987)

This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., landowners, residents, environmental groups, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

- Based on this public input, the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, officially adopted and promulgated the final regulations on **August 29, 1987**.

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Title**: *Cranbrook Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: These regulations may be cited as the *Cranbrook Airport Zoning Regulations*.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to the Cranbrook Airport located in the East Kootenay Regional District and Kootenay Land District, British Columbia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographical point used as a datum for measuring elevations and distances. It is located 197.83 meters west and perpendicular to the centerline of runway 16–34, 1,089.58 meters north of the southern end of the runway. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip. It ensures clear airspace for aircraft during landing approaches. Two approach surfaces are defined—one for runway 16, one for runway 34—each with different slopes and dimensions. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, except where terrain is too low (less than 9 meters above ground), in which case it is set at **9 meters above ground level**. This defines the maximum height allowed over the broader area surrounding the airport. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, specifically the 1,948.853-meter-long, 300-meter-wide runway (150 meters on each side of the centerline) associated with runway 16–34. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward and outward until it intersects with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. Designed to ensure safe separation between aircraft and obstacles. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: 924.5 meters above sea level.

#### **4. Geographic Applicability**

The regulations apply to **all lands**—including public road allowances—within the following boundaries:

1. **Lands within the outer limits** as described in **Part VI of the Schedule** (the official boundary description).
2. **Lands directly beneath** any portion of the approach surfaces that extend beyond the outer limits.

This means that **all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport** is subject to these height restrictions.

#### **5. Height Restrictions on Structures and Natural Features**

##### **(a) Prohibition on Construction**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land covered by these regulations,
- If the **highest point** of such object exceeds:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

> This rule ensures that no physical obstruction (e.g., trees, towers, buildings) interferes with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

##### **(b) Management of Natural Growth**
If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes) exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces:
- The **Minister of Transport** may require the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This provision protects aviation safety by preventing overhanging vegetation that could interfere with aircraft visibility or flight paths.

##### **(c) Prohibition on Waste Disposal**
No owner or occupier may:
- Use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** or
  - **Attractive to birds**

> This prevents the accumulation of food sources that could attract birds to the airport, reducing the risk of bird strikes—dangerous events that can lead to aircraft damage or accidents.

#### **6. Detailed Descriptions of Key Components**

##### **(a) Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located **197.83 m west and perpendicular** to the centerline of runway 16–34.
- 1,089.58 m north of the southern end of the strip.
- Marked by a **brass plate** in a concrete catch basin.
- Identified as **Department of Transport Monument No. 126 + 22.50**.

##### **(b) Approach Surfaces**
- **Runway 16 Approach**:
  - Inclined plane with **1:50 slope** (1 meter rise per 50 meters run).
  - Rises to a horizontal line **15,000 meters** from the end of the strip.
  - Outer ends of this line are **2,400 meters** from the runway centerline.
  - The horizontal line is **300 meters above** the elevation at the end of the strip.

- **Runway 34 Approach**:
  - Inclined plane with **1.25:50 slope** (1.25 meters rise per 50 meters run).
  - Rises to a horizontal line **3,000 meters** from the end of the strip.
  - Outer ends are **450 meters** from the centerline.
  - The horizontal line is **75 meters above** the elevation at the end of the strip.

> These surfaces are designed to provide a safe zone for aircraft during final approach, minimizing the risk of collision with terrain or obstructions.

##### **(c) Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (924.5 m = 969.5 m ASL)**.
- **Exception**: If the ground elevation is less than 9 meters above ground level, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground**.
- This defines the **maximum allowable height** for any structure or natural feature across the entire airport perimeter.

##### **(d) Strip (Runway 16–34)**
- **Length**: 1,948.853 meters
- **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the centerline)
- This is the primary runway used for takeoffs and landings.

##### **(e) Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes with **1:7 slope** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontal distance).
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of the strip and its approach surfaces.
- Rise until they meet either:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - Another transitional surface of an adjacent strip (e.g., if there are multiple runways or parallel strips).
- These surfaces ensure smooth transitions between the runway area and the outer zones, maintaining safe flight corridors.

#### **7. Boundary of the Outer Limits (Part VI of the Schedule)**

The boundary is a complex, multi-segmented polygon described in precise survey terms, based on grid bearings, distances, and land lot references. Key features include:

- Starts at the **northeasterly corner of District Lot 340, Kootenay District**.
- Follows a **circular curve of radius 4,000 meters** to a point of tangency.
- Includes alignments along:
  - The **westerly limit of Kootenay Indian Reserve No. 1**,
  - The **northerly limit of District Lot 2 (right bank of Saint Mary River)**,
  - Various **district lots** (e.g., 1, 494, 11570, 7010, 8898, 5267, 2045, 8748),
  - The **southerly limit of a statutory highway right-of-way (Plan 15445)**,
  - And ends at the **northeasterly corner of sub-lot 12 of District Lot 340**.

> This boundary forms a large, irregular zone around the airport, defining the area subject to height and land-use restrictions.

#### **8. Exclusions from the Regulatory Zone**

Certain lands are **exempt** from the application of these regulations:

- **Kootenay Indian Reserve No. 1** (Plan B.C. 55 (C.L.S.R.))
- **District Lots 494, 1758**, and **parts of District Lot 1**,
