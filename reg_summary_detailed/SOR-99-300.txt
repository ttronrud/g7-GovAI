### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation provides a clear and precise legal definition of two key terms used in **Section 21.1** of the *Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act*. These definitions are essential for determining how advertising revenues are calculated and reported—particularly when assessing the commercial value of periodicals distributed in Canada and their associated materials (such as inserts or supplements).

The objective is to ensure consistency, transparency, and clarity in the application of the Act, especially in determining whether foreign publishers are subject to specific obligations or reporting requirements related to advertising revenues generated in Canada.

### **Key Definitions**

#### 1. **Revenues Generated by the Supply of Advertising Services Directed at the Canadian Market**

- **Definition:**  
  This refers to the total amount of space (e.g., full pages, partial pages, or lines) on a page or any portion of a page that is dedicated to **paid advertisements** placed by:
  - A Canadian advertiser, or  
  - A person acting on behalf of a Canadian advertiser  
  - And that are specifically **directed at the Canadian market**.

- **Scope:**  
  - Applies to **each issue** of a periodical (e.g., a magazine or newspaper).  
  - Includes **any material accompanying** the periodical—whether attached or embedded (e.g., inserts, flyers, supplements)—as long as such material is part of the same publication and is included in the distribution to Canadian readers.

- **Key Criteria:**  
  - The advertisements must be **paid for** (i.e., not free or unpaid).  
  - The advertisements must be **targeted at Canadian consumers** (i.e., intended to reach or influence Canadians).  
  - The space used for such ads must be measured in terms of **page space or lines**, not revenue per se.

- **Purpose of the Definition:**  
  To distinguish between **market-specific advertising revenue** (directed at Canadians) and general advertising revenue, which may be used to determine eligibility for certain exemptions or reporting obligations under Section 21.1.

#### 2. **Revenues Generated by the Total Supply of Advertising Services**

- **Definition:**  
  This refers to the **total amount of space** on a page or any part of a page or any lines on a page that is dedicated to **paid advertisements**, regardless of whether they are directed at the Canadian market.

- **Scope:**  
  - Applies to the **entire issue** of a periodical and any accompanying material.  
  - Includes all paid advertisements, whether or not they are aimed at Canadian audiences.

- **Key Difference from the First Definition:**  
  - This is a **broader** and **more inclusive** measure.  
  - It does **not** require that the advertisements be directed at the Canadian market.  
  - It captures **all paid ad space**, including ads targeted at international audiences or general public interest.

- **Purpose of the Definition:**  
  To provide a baseline for measuring the overall advertising activity of a periodical, which may be used in assessing the commercial scale of the publication and its potential impact on Canadian media markets.

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Application in Section 21.1:**  
  These definitions are directly used in **Section 21.1** of the *Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act*, which governs the conditions under which foreign publishers may provide advertising services to Canadian media outlets or operate in Canada.  
  The distinction between "directed at the Canadian market" and "total supply" helps determine:
  - Whether a foreign publisher is subject to reporting or licensing requirements.
  - Whether advertising revenue from Canadian-targeted ads qualifies for certain exemptions or benefits.
  - How revenue is assessed for compliance with Canadian content or advertising standards.

- **Clarity and Enforcement:**  
  By clearly defining what constitutes "advertising space" and how it is categorized, the regulation enhances legal certainty for:
  - Foreign publishers
  - Canadian media organizations
  - Regulatory authorities (e.g., the Minister of Canadian Heritage)

- **Exclusion of Non-Ad Space:**  
  The definitions explicitly exclude unpaid advertisements, editorial content, or non-commercial features (such as news stories or opinion pieces).

---

### **Effective Date and Implementation**

- The regulations came into force on **July 1, 1999**.  
- They are binding and apply to all periodicals and related materials distributed in Canada from that date onward.  
- They are part of the legislative framework under the *Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act*, which aims to protect Canadian media interests and ensure fair competition in the advertising market.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides essential, legally binding definitions to clarify how advertising revenue is measured in the context of foreign publishers operating in Canada. By distinguishing between:
- **Canadian-market-targeted advertising revenue** (a narrower, market-specific measure), and  
- **Total advertising revenue** (a broader, all-inclusive measure),  

the regulation enables consistent interpretation and enforcement of Section 21.1 of the *Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act*. This supports transparency, fair market practices, and the protection of Canadian media interests in the advertising ecosystem.

**Note:** These definitions are critical for compliance, audit, and policy development related to foreign media advertising in Canada. They remain relevant in the context of media regulation and cross-border advertising practices.
