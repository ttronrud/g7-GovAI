The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been officially **repealed** (cancelled or removed) by the **Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR/2017-84)**, under section 1 of that rule.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  The regulation was formally revoked and no longer in force as of the date specified in the repeal notice.

- **Repeal Source**:  
  The repeal is issued under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which is a statutory rule published in the *Ontario Gazette* on May 18, 2017. This rule typically contains provisions that repeal previously enacted regulations, often as part of a legislative review, consolidation, or simplification of the regulatory framework.

- **Nature of the Regulation (Inferred)**:  
  Although the original content of the repealed regulation is not provided, the repeated citation suggests that it was likely a **specific regulatory provision** (possibly related to licensing, safety, environmental standards, or workplace rules) that was deemed outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current legislation or policy. The repeal implies that the regulation was no longer necessary or applicable.

- **Reason for Repeal (Typical Justifications)**:  
  Common reasons for such repeals include:
  - The regulation was superseded by newer legislation.
  - It was found to be inconsistent with current laws or policies.
  - It created administrative burdens or confusion.
  - It was redundant or overlapping with other existing rules.
  - It was part of a broader regulatory modernization or streamlining effort.

- **Legal Effect**:  
  After repeal, the regulation is **no longer enforceable**, and any actions or obligations previously governed by it are no longer valid. Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to the current, active regulations that have replaced or succeeded it.

- **Access to Original Content**:  
  The original text of the repealed regulation would have been published in the *Ontario Gazette* prior to the repeal. For access, one would need to consult the official archives of the Ontario government’s *Gazette* or the *Regulations Amending Act* database (e.g., through the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General or the Ontario Government’s official legislation website).

### Conclusion:

There is no active legal or regulatory authority governing the subject matter of the repealed regulation. Any reference to it in current legal or compliance contexts should be treated as obsolete, and practitioners or officials should consult current, active regulations for applicable requirements.
