**Detailed Summary of the Divestiture Regulations for Former Employees of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (CANDU Reactor Division)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Divestiture Regulations for Former Employees of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (CANDU Reactor Division)* were enacted by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, based on recommendations from the **President of the Treasury Board**. The regulations are grounded in specific provisions of two key federal statutes:

- **Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**:
  - **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a** and **subsection 42.1(2)b**: These authorize the Treasury Board to make regulations regarding the treatment of former public service employees who transitioned to private-sector employment through divestiture or restructuring.
  - The PSSA governs the superannuation (pension) rights of public service employees and their dependents.

- **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**:
  - **Paragraph 7(2)(a)**: Provides the Treasury Board with authority to issue regulations related to the administration of public service superannuation, including special rules for employees transitioning from public to private sectors.

These regulations were introduced under **S.C. 2003, c. 22, par. 225(z.19)** and **S.C. 2012, c. 31, s. 499(3)**, and are codified in the **Public Service Superannuation Act (R.S., c. P-36)** and the **Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)**.

### **2. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply **only to individuals who meet the following specific criteria**:

1. **Employment History**:
   - The individual was previously employed by **Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)**.
   - On **October 2, 2011**, they transitioned to employment with **Candu Energy Inc.** as a result of a tripartite agreement signed on **June 29, 2011** between:
     - Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL),
     - Candu Energy Inc.,
     - SNC Lavalin Group Inc.
   - The individual has continued to be employed by Candu Energy Inc. **without interruption** until the coming into force of these regulations.

2. **Loss of Public Service Status**:
   - The individual ceased to be deemed to be employed in the public service under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* on **October 2, 2014**.
   - This status change was due to:
     - The **ceasing of Candu Energy Inc.'s status as a public service entity**, and
     - A **direction issued by the Treasury Board on June 23, 2011** under **subsection 40.1(2)** of the PSSA, which formally removed Candu Energy Inc. from the public service.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**: These regulations **do not apply** to individuals who are **re-employed by Candu Energy Inc.** after the date of termination.

---

### **3. Exclusions and Special Provisions**

- **Sections 2, 3, and 7 of the PSSA** (which generally govern contributions, service periods, and eligibility) **do not apply** to:
  - The **survivors** (spouse or common-law partner) or
  - The **children** of a person who:
    - Has received a **return of contributions**, or
    - Has exercised an **option under subsection 6(2)** of the PSSA (which allows for early retirement or return of contributions).

> This means that survivor and children benefits are treated differently in these cases.

---

### **4. Death Benefits for Survivors and Dependents**

If a person dies while employed by Candu Energy Inc., their **survivors and children** are entitled to **one of the following benefits**, which would have been available had the individual been employed in the public service:

- **Death benefit under subsection 12(8) of the PSSA** (a lump sum payment to dependents upon death).
- **Allowances under subsection 13(3) of the PSSA** (such as a survivor’s allowance or children’s allowance).

> These benefits are **not dependent on public service status** but are instead granted based on the individual's employment with Candu Energy Inc. during the relevant period.

---

### **5. Age and Pensionable Service for Public Service Purposes**

- **For the purposes of sections 12 (death benefit), 13 (survivor benefits), and 13.01 (pension options)**:
  - A person’s **age at cessation of public service** is defined as their **age on the day they cease to be employed by Candu Energy Inc.** (i.e., October 2, 2014).
  - This ensures consistency in calculating pension entitlements and eligibility thresholds.

- **Pensionable Service**:
  - Includes the period of service that begins on **October 2, 2014** and ends on the day the individual ceases to be employed by Candu Energy Inc.
  - This period is **treated as pensionable service** under the PSSA, even though the employee was no longer considered a public servant at that time.

> This provision is critical because it allows individuals to accumulate pensionable service time from the date they transitioned to private employment, which may otherwise have been excluded from pension calculations.

---

### **6. Application of Sections 12, 13, and 13.01**

- These sections (death benefits, survivor benefits, and pension options) **only apply to the individual as of the day they cease to be employed by Candu Energy Inc.** (October 2, 2014).
- However, if, **in the absence of these regulations**, the individual would have been entitled to:
  - A **return of contributions** under **subsection 12(3)** of the PSSA, or
  - An **option under section 13.01** (e.g., to withdraw pension funds or convert to a lump sum),
  
  Then they may:
  - **Request a return of contributions** in writing **no later than October 1, 2015**.
  - **Exercise the option** under section 13.01 within the same time frame (October 1, 2015).

> This creates a **limited window** for individuals to access certain financial options that would otherwise have been available only if they were still considered public servants.

---

### **7. Deemed Cessation of Employment in Public Service**

- For the purposes of **subsection 26(2)** of the PSSA, a person is **deemed to cease to be employed in the public service on the day they cease to be employed by Candu Energy Inc.** (October 2, 2014).
- This is a key administrative clarification to ensure that all pension and superannuation rules are applied consistently with the date of transition.

---

### **8. Classification as a Group 1 Contributor**

- Individuals to whom these regulations apply are **classified as Group 1 contributors** under the PSSA.
- Group 1 contributors are typically those who were employed in the public service and are eligible for standard public service superannuation benefits.
- This classification ensures that these individuals are treated in the same way as other public servants in terms of pension and benefit entitlements, despite their transition to a private employer.

---

### **9. Effective Date**

- These regulations **came into force on October 2, 2014**, the same day that Candu Energy Inc. ceased to be deemed part of the public service.

> This ensures that all rights, obligations, and transitional arrangements are applied at the moment of the transition from public to private sector status.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transition Management** | Provides a clear legal framework for managing the superannuation rights of AECL employees who moved to Candu Energy Inc. |
| **Continuity of Benefits** | Ensures that pensionable service and survivor benefits are preserved despite the loss of public service status. |
| **Fairness and Equity** | Gives affected employees a defined window (until October 1, 2015) to access returns of contributions or pension options. |
| **Administrative Clarity** | Defines key dates (e.g., age, service periods, cessation of employment) to avoid ambiguity in benefit calculations. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Divestiture Regulations for Former Employees of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (CANDU Reactor Division)* are a targeted set of rules designed to **protect the superannuation rights** of former public servants who transitioned to private employment through a formal agreement between AECL, Candu Energy Inc., and SNC Lavalin. 

By recognizing the period of employment with Candu Energy Inc. (from October 2, 2014 onward) as **pensionable service**, and by providing a **clear pathway for returns of contributions or pension options**, the regulations ensure that these employees are not disadvantaged by the change in employer status. They also provide **legal certainty** for survivors and dependents, and maintain consistency with public service superannuation principles.

These regulations represent a balanced approach to **divestiture**, ensuring that employees retain key benefits while respecting the restructuring of public institutions.
