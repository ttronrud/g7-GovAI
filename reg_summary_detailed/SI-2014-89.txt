## 📅 Creditable Periods and Benefit Calculations

### For OAS (Canada):
- A period of **employment or self-employment in Serbia** during which a person contributes to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** counts as **residence in Canada**.
- This applies to the person and their **spouse/common-law partner and dependants** (if not subject to Serbian employment/self-employment).
- **Reverse rule**: A period in Canada where a person contributes to Serbian legislation **does NOT** count as residence in Canada for OAS purposes.

### For CPP (Canada):
- A **calendar year** that includes **at least 3 months** of creditable periods in Serbia counts as a **creditable year** under CPP.

### For Serbian Pension Eligibility:
- A **calendar year** of CPP contributions counts as **12 months** of creditable periods in Serbia.
- A **month** of OAS contributions (not part of a CPP period) counts as **1 month** of creditable time in Serbia.

> ⚠️ These rules apply only when totalizing periods under **Chapter 1** (residence/contribution periods).

## 📊 Eligibility and Benefit Amounts

### 1. When No Benefit Exists Based on Totalized Periods
- If total creditable periods under one country are **less than one year** and do not meet eligibility thresholds, **no benefit is payable** for those periods.
- However, these periods **are still considered** when determining eligibility for benefits from the **other country**.

### 2. Full Pension Eligibility via Totalizing
- If a person is eligible **only through totalizing**, the Canadian institution calculates the benefit as follows:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based solely on **CPP pensionable earnings**.
  - **Flat-rate portion**:  
    = (Flat-rate amount under CPP) ×  
    (Ratio of CPP contribution periods / Minimum qualifying period)  
    → Ratio **cannot exceed 1.0**.

### 3. Serbian Pension Calculation
- If a person is eligible **only through totalizing**, the Serbian institution:
  1. Calculates the **theoretical pension** they would receive if all periods were accumulated under **Serbian law alone**.
  2. Applies a **ratio**:
     - (Length of Serbian creditable periods) / (Total creditable periods from both countries)
     - This ratio is
