### **Detailed Summary of the Compensation for Destroyed Animals Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations were issued by the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food of Canada**, under the authority granted by **paragraphs 55(b)a and (c) of the Health of Animals Act (HAA)**.  
- The regulations are formally registered under **S.C. 1997, c. 6, s. 71** and **S.C. 1990, c. 21**.  
- They were published in **Ottawa on June 8, 2000**, and came into force on the day of registration.

This means the Minister has the legal power to establish rules regarding compensation for owners of animals that are destroyed or required to be destroyed due to animal health or disease concerns.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several important terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Health of Animals Act*, which governs animal health, disease control, and related procedures. |
| **Grandparent breeder** | A bird belonging to a flock of pureline poultry (one or more generations) maintained specifically to establish, continue, or improve parent lines from which commercial breeding stock is derived. These birds are critical to breeding programs and are often of high genetic value. |
| **Parent breeder** | A bird in a flock maintained to multiply parent flocks or produce commercial birds. These are used in commercial poultry production and are typically more numerous than grandparent breeders. |
| **Registered for the purposes of the schedule** | Means the animal is registered under the *Animal Pedigree Act*. This registration ensures the animal's lineage is documented and recognized for breeding and genetic purposes. |

> These definitions are crucial because they determine whether an animal qualifies for enhanced compensation based on its breeding status.

#### **3. Maximum Compensation Amount (Section 51(3) of the HAA)**

Under subsection 51(3) of the Health of Animals Act, the maximum compensation for an animal destroyed or required to be destroyed is determined as follows:

- **If the animal is listed in Column 1 of the Schedule** (i.e., it is a grandparent or parent breeder and registered under the Animal Pedigree Act):  
  → Compensation is equal to the amount specified in **Column 3** of that schedule item.

- **In all other cases** (e.g., non-registered, non-breeding animals):  
  → The maximum compensation is **$30**.

> This provision ensures that breeding stock—especially those with significant genetic or economic value—receives higher compensation than general livestock or non-breeding animals.

---

#### **4. Eligible Costs for Compensation**

Compensation may be paid to the owner for **reasonable costs** associated with the destruction or disposal of an animal or its carcass/related items, **subject to specific conditions**.

---

##### **A. When the Animal is Slaughtered at an Abattoir (Paragraph 27.6(1)(b) or Section 48(1))**

*Conditions*:  
- The animal must be transported to the abattoir **within the time and manner specified** in the official notice issued under subsections 27.6(3) or 48(3) of the HAA.

**Eligible Costs**:
1. **Transportation costs**  
   - Reasonable costs incurred by the owner to transport the animal to the abattoir.  
   - Maximum: The amount a **commercial trucker** would normally charge for such a transport (if not required to be destroyed).

2. **Labour costs for personal work**  
   - Costs for the owner’s personal labour involved in transporting the animal.  
   - Maximum: The amount a **local agricultural worker** would normally be paid for similar work.

3. **Slaughtering costs at the abattoir**  
   - Reasonable costs incurred by the owner related to the slaughter process.  
   - These costs must be directly tied to the reason for destruction (e.g., disease control).

> These costs are only payable if the animal is destroyed via abattoir slaughter and meets the required transport conditions.

---

##### **B. When the Animal is Destroyed Elsewhere (Not at an Abattoir)**

*Conditions*:  
- The animal is destroyed or its carcass/thing is disposed of **within the time and manner specified** in the notice under subsections 27.6(3) or 48(3).

**Eligible Costs**:
1. **Transportation costs**  
   - Reasonable costs to transport the animal to the destruction site or the carcass/thing to the disposal site.  
   - Maximum: The cost a **commercial trucker** would normally charge for this service.

2. **Cleaning and disinfecting costs**  
   - Costs for cleaning and disinfecting the vehicle used for transport.  
   - Maximum: The amount a **commercial service** would normally charge for such cleaning.

3. **Costs to destroy the animal or dispose of the carcass/thing**  
   - If the owner performs the destruction: costs for supplies, equipment, and labour.  
   - If a commercial service is used: the cost of that service.  
   - Maximum: The amount a **commercial service** would normally charge for the destruction or disposal.

4. **Labour costs for personal work**  
   - Includes personal labour for:  
     - Transporting the animal or carcass  
     - Cleaning and disinfecting the conveyance  
     - Destroying the animal or disposing of the carcass  
   - Maximum: The amount a **local agricultural worker** would normally be paid for such work.

> This ensures that owners are compensated for both direct and indirect expenses related to compliance with disease control measures.

---

#### **5. Compensation for the Carcass Value**

The maximum compensation for the **value of the carcass** is determined based on whether the carcass was condemned:

- **If the carcass has NOT been condemned**:  
  → Compensation equals the **value of the carcass** as defined in **paragraph 51(2)(b)** of the HAA.

- **If the carcass HAS been condemned**:  
  → Compensation equals the **value the carcass would have had if not condemned** (i.e., the hypothetical value before condemnation).

> This is a critical point: even if the carcass is condemned, the owner is compensated for its *potential market value*, not just its actual value after condemnation. This protects owners from financial loss due to disease-related condemnation.

---

#### **6. Eligible Items for Disposal Compensation**

Compensation for **disposal costs** may only be paid for the following **specific items**:

- **Animal food** (e.g., feed, pellets, grain)  
- **Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers** intended primarily for **domestic (dwelling) use**, but **not** commercial or walk-in units  
- **Cages, crates, and nesting boxes**  
- **Feed troughs**

> These items are excluded from compensation if they are commercial-grade or used in commercial operations. The focus is on household or farm-use items that may be contaminated and require disposal after an animal is destroyed.

> **Note**: This restriction ensures that only items with clear domestic or farm-use relevance are eligible for compensation.

---

#### **7. Repeal Clause**

The regulations contain a **"Repeal" clause**, indicating that this version of the rules supersedes or replaces any previous versions of the Compensation for Destroyed Animals Regulations. This ensures that the current rules are the most up-to-date and legally valid.

---

#### **8. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (June 8, 2000). This means they are immediately applicable upon publication and registration.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Disease Control & Animal Welfare** | Ensures that animal owners are not financially penalized when animals must be destroyed due to disease or health risks. |
| **Support for Breeding Programs** | Grandparent and parent breeders receive higher compensation due to their economic and genetic importance. |
| **Fair Compensation for Costs** | Covers real, reasonable expenses incurred during transport, labour, cleaning, and disposal. |
| **Prevention of Financial Loss** | Even if a carcass is condemned, owners are compensated for its lost market value. |
| **Targeted Support** | Only certain types of items (e.g., household refrigerators, cages) are eligible for disposal compensation—preventing abuse or overreach. |

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**

These regulations provide **financial support to animal owners** when they are legally required to destroy an animal due to disease or health concerns. The support includes:

- **Transportation costs** (to the abattoir or destruction site),  
- **Labour costs** (for the owner’s personal effort),  
- **Slaughtering or disposal costs**,  
- And **value of the carcass**, even if it is condemned.

Animals with special breeding status (grandparent or parent breeders) receive **higher compensation**. Only certain household items are eligible for disposal cost reimbursement. The rules are designed to ensure fairness, reduce financial hardship, and support effective animal disease control programs.

### **Conclusion**

The *Compensation for Destroyed Animals Regulations* are a critical component of Canada’s animal health framework. They balance public health and animal disease control with the economic well-being of farmers and poultry owners. By clearly defining eligible costs, setting maximum compensation levels, and protecting high-value breeding stock,
