### **Detailed Summary of the Social Insurance Number Regulations (Canada)**  
*Effective Date: April 30, 2013*  
*Approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development*  
*Pursuant to subsection 28.2(4)a of the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act and section 140c of the Employment Insurance Act*

---

## **Overview**

The **Social Insurance Number (SIN) Regulations** establish the rules governing the **issuance, application, validity, replacement, and revocation** of Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) in Canada. These regulations are administered by the **Canada Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC)** and are designed to ensure that individuals who are legally entitled to a SIN—particularly those in Canada’s workforce—are properly identified and registered for access to employment insurance, tax, and other federal programs.

The regulations provide clear procedural requirements for applying to register for a SIN, define who can apply and under what circumstances, and establish specific rules for validity periods—especially for non-citizens and permanent residents—based on immigration status and duration of stay in Canada.

## **Application Requirements for Registration**

### **1. Required Information in Application**
An application to register a person must include **supporting documents** that allow identification of:
- Full name of the applicant;
- Name at birth (if different from current name);
- Date of birth;
- Place of birth;
- Full names at birth of both parents.

> ⚠️ *Note: Paragraphs on name at birth and parent details were repealed in SOR/2018-136, s. 2 — this suggests some of the original requirements have been updated or replaced by newer policy.*

### **2. Who Can Submit the Application?**
- **If the person is 12 years of age or older**, the application must be:
  - Signed by the individual themselves,
  - Or by one of their parents,
  - Or by any other person legally authorized to act on their behalf.

- **If the person is under 12 years of age**, the application must be submitted by:
  - One of their parents, or
  - Any other person legally authorized to act in their name.

### **3. Birth Registration Agreements**
If a **pre-existing agreement** exists between the CEIC and the provincial government where the person was born, the application must be signed by an **official responsible for registering births** in that province.

### **4. Signing Capacity for Individuals Unable to Sign**
- If a person **cannot sign** their name, they may **attest** the application by making a **personal mark** in the presence of **two witnesses**, who must sign the form.
- The Commission may still **register the person and assign a SIN** even if there is no signature or mark, provided the application meets all other requirements.

### **5. Refusal to Apply Despite Legal Requirement**
- If a person **is required by law to have a SIN** (e.g., for employment or tax purposes) but **refuses to apply**, the Commission may still register them and assign a SIN **if it has sufficient information to verify identity and status**.

---

## **Replacement of Lost, Destroyed, or Defaced SIN Cards**

### **Process for Replacement**
To apply for a replacement SIN card:
- The application must be submitted in the **form and manner required** by the Commission.
- It must include:
  - The **same information and documents** required under section 2 (name, date of birth, place of birth, parent names, etc.);
  - Either:
    - The applicant’s **current SIN**, or
    - A **statement confirming** that they were previously assigned a SIN.

> ⚠️ *Note: This section was repealed in SOR/2018-136, s. 5 — indicating that the process may have been updated or replaced by new guidelines.*

## **Special Rules for Non-Citizens and Non-Permanent Residents**

### **1. Purpose of Application Requirement**
For individuals who are **not Canadian citizens or permanent residents**, and for whom the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has issued a direction under section 90 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act**, the application must include:
- The **purpose** for which the SIN is being requested (e.g., employment, access to health services, financial services).

### **2. SIN Format Begins with “9”**
- All SINs assigned to non-citizens or non-permanent residents begin with the digit **"9"**.

### **3. Validity Periods for SINs Starting with “9”**

| Scenario | Validity Period |
|--------|------------------|
| Person was **not in Canada** when they applied | Expires **5 years** after the date of assignment |
| Person was **in Canada** when they applied | Expires on the **earlier of**: <br> - The day their authorized stay in Canada ends (as per *subsection 183(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations*); <br> - **Two years** after the date of assignment |

> This ensures that temporary foreign workers or visitors do not retain SINs indefinitely and that their access to federal programs is time-limited and tied to their immigration status.

### **4. Extension or Renewal of SINs Beginning with “9”**
- A person may apply at any time after assignment to:
  - **Extend** the validity period, or
  - Obtain a **new period of validity** equivalent to the standard period (5 years or 2 years).
- The renewal application must include:
  - All required documents and information from section 2;
  - A clear statement of the **purpose** for which the SIN was originally applied (as stated in the original registration application).

> This allows flexibility for individuals whose stay in Canada may be extended due to work, study, or family reasons.

---

## **Change in Status: Citizenship or Permanent Residency**

### **1. Notification of Change**
- A person who is **not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident** and who later becomes one **must notify the Commission** of:
  - The change in status;
  - The previously assigned SIN (which begins with “9”).

### **2. Action by the Commission**
- Upon receiving the notification, the Commission must:
  - **Void** the previous SIN (beginning with “9”);
  - Assign a **new SIN** to the individual, which will now begin with a standard number (not “9”), reflecting their new status as a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.

> This ensures that citizens and permanent residents are issued permanent SINs, not temporary ones tied to immigration status.

---

## **Automatic Revocation of SINs (Non-Citizens with Non-“9” SINs)**

- If a **non-citizen** applies for:
  - A **replacement SIN card**, or
  - A **change of name** (under *section 28.3 of the Act* or *section 139 of the Employment Insurance Act*),
  and their **current SIN does not begin with “9”**,

→ The Commission **must void** the existing SIN and assign a **new SIN beginning with “9”**.

> This rule prevents non-citizens from retaining a permanent SIN that is not tied to their temporary status and ensures compliance with the temporary validity framework.

---

## **Historical Note: Expiry of Pre-2004 SINs**

> **Repealed provision**: Any SIN card issued **without an expiry date** to a person who was **not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident** expired on **April 3, 2004**.

- This was a transitional measure to phase out outdated SINs that had no clear validity period.
- It reflects a policy shift to standardize the validity of temporary SINs for foreign nationals.

> ⚠️ This provision was repealed in SOR/2018-136, s. 8 — suggesting that current policy now manages validity through the "beginning with 9" rule instead of a fixed expiry date.

---

## **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on April 30, 2013**.

## **Key Policy Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Identity Verification** | Ensures accurate identification through required documentation and name/parental details. |
| **Temporary Access Control** | Limits the duration of SINs for non-citizens to align with immigration status and authorized stay. |
| **Legal Compliance** | Aligns SIN issuance with immigration laws (e.g., IRR), citizenship rules, and employment insurance requirements. |
| **Flexibility for Change of Status** | Allows for smooth transition when a foreign national becomes a citizen or permanent resident. |
| **Prevention of Fraud** | Requires verifiable identity and purpose of use, reducing misuse of SINs. |
