**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Potato Order**

---

### **Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled the *Alberta Potato Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a legal instrument that establishes the authority, powers, and responsibilities of the Alberta Potato Commission in regulating the marketing of potatoes in Alberta, particularly in interprovincial and export trade.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to *The Marketing of Agricultural Products Act of Alberta* (French: *Loi*). This is the foundational legislation that grants regulatory authority to agricultural marketing bodies, including the Alberta Potato Commission.

2. **"Commission"**  
   Refers to the *Alberta Potato Commission*, established under the *Plan Respecting the Alberta Potato Commission 1966*. This body is responsible for overseeing the marketing, pricing, and economic stability of potatoes grown in Alberta.

3. **"Potatoes"**  
   Defined as potatoes grown within the Province of Alberta and used either for human consumption or as seed potatoes. This definition limits the scope of the regulation to potatoes produced in Alberta and excludes other types of tubers or uses.

4. **"Provincial Regulations"**  
   Refers to *Regulations Relating to the Implementation of the Plan Respecting the Alberta Potato Commission 1966*, issued as Alberta Regulation 459/67 by the Agricultural Products Marketing Council and officially filed on December 8, 1967. These regulations provide detailed operational guidelines for how the Commission carries out its functions.

### **Powers of the Commission**

The Alberta Potato Commission is granted specific regulatory authority under the *Marketing of Agricultural Products Act* to manage the **interprovincial and export trade** of potatoes. This authority extends to the powers it already holds over **local marketing within Alberta**, provided certain conditions are met.

#### **Legal Authority Under the Act**
The Commission may exercise the following powers, with respect to persons and property located in Alberta:

- **Subsection 14a(5)** of the Act: Allows the Commission to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, including potatoes, in interprovincial and export markets.
  
- **Paragraphs 14d(1), 1 to 6, 8 to 10, 14, and 15**: These provisions authorize the Commission to:
  - Set and enforce rules related to the marketing, pricing, and distribution of potatoes.
  - Control or regulate the conditions under which potatoes are sold or transported.
  - Establish standards or requirements for quality, labeling, or packaging.
  - Regulate the timing and manner of sales or deliveries.
  - Prevent unfair practices in the market.

- **Subsection 17a(1)**: Grants the Commission the power to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, including the ability to establish marketing arrangements, pricing mechanisms, and market access rules.

> **Important Limitation**: These powers are subject to **subsection 17a(6)** of the Act, which likely imposes procedural or constitutional constraints—such as requiring public notice, consultation, or a fair process—before the Commission can exercise its authority.

### **Levies and Charges**

The Commission has the authority to:

- **Issue orders** to establish **levies or charges** on persons involved in the **production or marketing of potatoes** in Alberta.
- These levies are specifically targeted at individuals or entities described in **Section 3** of the Act (which typically includes producers, processors, packers, and exporters).
- The Commission may **classify these persons into different groups** (e.g., small farmers, large producers, exporters).
- For each group, the Commission can **set different levies or charges** based on factors such as volume, type of operation, or market role.

#### **Purpose of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected from these levies and charges may be used for:
- **Creation of reserves** (e.g., to stabilize prices during downturns).
- **Payment of operational expenses** and administrative costs of the Commission.
- **Covering losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of potatoes (e.g., due to market fluctuations or poor harvests).
- **Equalizing or adjusting financial outcomes** among potato producers.  
  This means the Commission can redistribute funds to ensure that producers who experience lower returns (e.g., due to low prices or poor market conditions) are compensated, promoting equity in the industry.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

1. **Market Stabilization**: By regulating interprovincial and export trade, the Commission helps prevent price volatility and ensures a stable market for Alberta potatoes.

2. **Equity Among Producers**: The use of levies to fund equalization ensures that smaller or less-resourced producers are not disproportionately affected by market downturns.

3. **Financial Sustainability**: The Commission can build financial reserves and manage its own expenses, which enhances its ability to respond to market shocks and support long-term planning.

4. **Regulatory Continuity**: The Order ensures that the Commission's powers are consistent with the original 1966 Plan and the 1967 Provincial Regulations, preserving institutional stability.

5. **Geographic Scope**: All actions are confined to persons and property within Alberta, ensuring that the regulation applies only to domestic operations and trade originating from the province.

### **Conclusion**

The *Alberta Potato Order* is a critical piece of agricultural regulation that empowers the Alberta Potato Commission to manage the marketing of potatoes in both domestic and international markets. It provides a structured framework for setting fair prices, managing market risks, and ensuring equitable financial outcomes among producers. By allowing the Commission to impose levies based on producer groupings and using those funds for reserves, operational costs, and loss compensation, the Order promotes economic stability and supports the long-term viability of Alberta’s potato industry.

This regulation reflects a balance between market freedom and government intervention, typical of agricultural marketing regimes designed to protect producers from market volatility while maintaining fair and efficient trade practices.
