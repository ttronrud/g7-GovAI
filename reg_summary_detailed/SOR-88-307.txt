**Detailed Summary of the New Brunswick Potato Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export) Order — No. 2**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The **New Brunswick Potato Agency** (hereinafter referred to as the *Commodity Board*) enacted this regulation under **Section 3 and Section 4 of the New Brunswick Potato Order**, which was originally established by **Order in Council P.C. 1980-2344**, dated September 5, 1980. This specific Order is a statutory instrument issued to implement and administer marketing levies on potatoes produced in designated areas of New Brunswick and sold in **interprovincial and export markets**.

- **Gazette Publication**:  
  The Order was officially published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **May 31, 1988**, under **SOR/85-144**.  
  The original enabling order (P.C. 1980-2344) was published in **SOR/80-726** on September 5, 1980.

- **Citation**:  
  The Order is officially cited as:  
  **New Brunswick Potato Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export) Order — No. 2**

---

### **2. Scope and Applicability**
- **Applicable Area**:  
  The Order applies to potatoes produced within a **designated area in New Brunswick**.  
  ⚠️ *Note*: The term "designated area" was **repealed** by **SOR/2020-127, section 1**, meaning the geographic scope is no longer explicitly defined in this Order. This suggests that the levy may now apply broadly to all potato-producing operations in the province, or that the designation has been replaced by other regulatory mechanisms.

- **Applicable Activities**:  
  The levy applies to:
  - The **marketing of potatoes** in **interprovincial trade** (sales to other Canadian provinces).
  - The **export trade** of potatoes (sales outside Canada).

- **Applicable Persons and Property**:  
  The Order governs **persons and property located within the Province of New Brunswick**.

---

### **3. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Commodity Board**:  
  Refers to the **New Brunswick Potato Agency**, which is responsible for administering, collecting, and managing the levies under this Order.

- **Producer**:  
  A **person who produces potatoes on at least four acres of land in any given year**.  
  This threshold ensures that only significant producers are subject to the levy, potentially reducing administrative burden on small-scale growers.

  - *Note*: The term "person" was repealed by **SOR/90-692, section 1**, and is no longer used in this Order.

---

### **4. Levy Amount and Application**
- **Levy Rate**:  
  Every producer must pay a levy of **$16.50 per acre** for each acre used in the production of potatoes, either directly or on their behalf.

- **Calculation**:  
  The levy is calculated based on the **total acreage used** in potato production during the year. For example:
  - A producer with 10 acres would owe:  
    10 acres × $16.50 = **$165.00**

---

### **5. Payment and Remittance Requirements**
- **Timing of Payment**:  
  The producer must **remit the levy to the Commodity Board within 30 days** of selling their entire crop of potatoes.

- **Trigger for Payment**:  
  Payment is due upon the **completion of the full sale** of the crop. This ensures that the levy is collected only after the potatoes have entered the interprovincial or export market.

- **Collection Responsibility**:  
  The **Commodity Board** is responsible for collecting the levy and managing its administration.

---

### **6. Key Regulatory Notes and Context**
- **Purpose of the Levy**:  
  The levy is designed to:
  - Support the **economic stability and marketing of New Brunswick potatoes** in competitive interprovincial and export markets.
  - Fund **marketing programs**, quality control, promotion, and infrastructure related to potato exports.
  - Ensure fair and equitable participation in the broader Canadian and international potato market.

- **Historical Context**:  
  This Order is part of a broader framework of **agricultural marketing levies** introduced in the 1980s to support regional agricultural products. The 1980 Order in Council established the foundational structure, and subsequent amendments (like the 1985 publication and 2020 repeal) reflect evolving administrative and policy needs.

- **Repeals and Updates**:
  - **"Designated area"** was repealed by **SOR/2020-127, s. 1** — indicating a shift toward a province-wide application of the levy.
  - **"Person"** was repealed by **SOR/90-692, s. 1** — suggesting that the definition of producer is now more clearly defined by acreage and activity.
  - These repeals reflect modernization efforts to simplify and clarify the regulatory framework.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
This Order establishes a clear, enforceable mechanism for collecting a **$16.50 per acre levy** from potato producers in New Brunswick who market their crops **interprovincially or internationally**. It is a key component of the province’s agricultural marketing policy, aimed at ensuring sustainable and competitive potato exports.

While the original geographic scope ("designated area") has been repealed, the core levy structure remains in place, with the levy now applying to all potato producers meeting the **four-acre threshold**. The 30-day payment deadline ensures timely revenue collection, and the Commodity Board retains oversight and administrative responsibility.

**Summary in One Sentence**:  
The New Brunswick Potato Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export) Order — No. 2 mandates that potato producers in New Brunswick who grow at least four acres and sell their crops outside the province pay a levy of $16.50 per acre, to be remitted within 30 days of selling their entire crop.
