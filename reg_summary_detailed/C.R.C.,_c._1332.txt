**Detailed Summary of the *Public Servants Inventions Regulations***

---

### **Overview**

The *Public Servants Inventions Regulations* (the "Regulations") implement and operationalize provisions of the *Public Servants Inventions Act* (the "Act") to govern the ownership and patent rights of inventions created by public servants in Canada. These regulations establish a structured process for determining whether an invention is vested in Her Majesty in right of Canada, outline the required disclosures, define procedures for patent applications, and set out the rights and obligations of inventors, supervisors, and government ministers.

The Regulations were originally enacted to balance the public interest in innovation and national technological advancement with the rights of individual inventors—particularly those who may be employed by federal departments or agencies. They are now **revoked** under *SOR/93-296, section 1*, indicating that they are no longer in force. However, this summary provides a comprehensive, detailed analysis of their content and purpose as they existed prior to revocation.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Mandatory Disclosure by Public Servants**

Every public servant who invents an invention **must submit a completed Form 1** to the appropriate Minister (or an officer designated by the Minister), in addition to any information required under paragraph 4(1)(a) of the Act.

#### **What is required in Form 1?**
Form 1 contains detailed information about the invention, including:

- **Name(s)** and **address(es)** of inventor(s)
- **Residence** and **business address**
- **Nationality** of inventor(s)
- **Department or Government Agency** where the public servant is employed
- **Position(s)** and **type of work** performed
- **Proposed name or title** of the invention
- **Detailed description** under the following headings:
  - What is the problem?
  - How is it currently accomplished (based on present knowledge)?
  - Limitations or drawbacks of existing apparatus, product, or process?
  - What is the proposed solution?
  - What is novel about the proposal?
  - Has the invention been disclosed to others? If so, to whom, when, where, and how?
  - Are there published references or patents related to the problem or subject? If yes, provide them.
- **Circumstances of invention**:
  - Did it arise from duties or employment?
  - Was it made using Crown-provided facilities, equipment, or financial aid?

> **Note**: If space is insufficient, separate pages may be attached.

### **2. Triggering the Vesting Question**

A question as to whether an invention is **vested in Her Majesty** by the Act is **deemed to have arisen and referred to the Minister** on the date the public servant submits a **completed Form 1**.

This means that once the form is submitted, the Minister is legally required to consider the invention for vesting under the Act—regardless of whether a formal determination has yet been made.

---

### **3. Determination and Certificate of Vesting**

When the Minister makes a determination under **Section 5 of the Act**, that determination is deemed to be made on:

- The day the **certificate in Form 2** is **delivered personally** to the inventor, **or**
- The day it is **received by registered mail**.

#### **Delivery and Receipt Timelines**:
- If the inventor’s **latest known address is in Canada**:
  - Certificate is deemed received **three days after** it is sent by registered mail.
- If the inventor’s **address is outside Canada**:
  - Certificate is deemed received **seven days after** it is sent.

> This ensures that inventors have a reasonable period to receive official notice, even when communication is international.

---

### **4. Notification to the Patent Office**

If a patent application has been filed with the **Patent Office** and there is a question about whether the invention is vested in Her Majesty:

- The **appropriate Minister must file a copy of the Form 2 certificate** with the Patent Office upon being notified of the filing.

> The certificate **forms part of the patent application**, meaning it becomes a legally binding part of the filing record.

---

### **5. Admissibility of Certificates in Evidence**

A certificate in Form 2 **signed by the Minister or an authorized officer** is **admissible in evidence** without the need to prove:
- That the person signing is actually authorized to sign,
- That the signature is genuine.

> This streamlines legal proceedings involving ownership disputes.

---

### **6. Appeals and Applications to Federal Courts**

Any appeal under **Section 5(2)** or application under **Section 5(3)** of the Act must be initiated in accordance with **Section 48 of the Federal Courts Act**, which governs proceedings against the Crown.

#### Key Rules Applied:
- The term **"NOTICE OF APPEAL" or "APPLICATION"** replaces **"STATEMENT OF CLAIM" or "DECLARATION"** in Schedule A of the Federal Courts Act.
- The **Federal Court Rules** apply fully to such proceedings as if they were initiated under Section 48.

> This ensures that legal challenges to Ministerial determinations are handled through established, fair, and transparent judicial procedures.

---

### **7. Patent Ownership and Rights**

#### **When is a patent issued in the name of Her Majesty?**
If:
- The Minister determines the invention is **vested in Her Majesty**, **or**
- The application explicitly states the invention is vested in Her Majesty,

Then the patent issued will be in the name of **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, **unless**:

> The Minister, under **Section 8 of the Act**, **waives, abandons, or transfers** any Canadian ownership rights.

#### **Waiver, Abandonment, or Transfer of Rights**
If the Minister takes such action:
- An **instrument** (formal document) must be executed and **registered with the Patent Office**.
- The instrument must be in **Form 3 of the Schedule**.
- The instrument must be delivered **personally** or sent by **registered mail** to the inventor at their latest known address.

> This protects the inventor’s rights and ensures transparency in any transfer of ownership.

---

### **8. Application Forms for Patent Filing**

An application for a patent made by a public servant (alone or jointly with others) must be submitted in one of the following forms:
- **Form 4, 5, 6, or 7** of the Schedule  
> These forms are applicable depending on the nature and circumstances of the invention.

---

### **9. Ministerial Notification and Authority**

The **appropriate Minister** must maintain up-to-date records with the **Patent Office** regarding:
- The **name and position** of every individual who may sign documents on the Minister’s behalf.

> This ensures accountability and prevents unauthorized delegation of authority.

---
