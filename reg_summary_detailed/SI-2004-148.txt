**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Certain Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association Members Remission Order**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, and is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**. This means that the decision to grant tax remission is grounded in federal administrative power to manage and adjust tax obligations in the public interest.

The regulation is formally referenced as:  
**S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)** — a statutory citation indicating its inclusion in the *Statutes of Canada*, 1991, Chapter 24 (the *Excise Tax Act*).

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **grant a tax remission** (i.e., a refund or cancellation of tax liability) to specific individuals who paid annual maintenance fees to the **Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association** during a defined period. 

This remission is granted **because the tax paid on those fees was not actually payable** under the Excise Tax Act, and doing so is considered to be in the **public interest**.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*, which governs excise taxes and related obligations. |
| **Eligible Claimant** | An individual who: <br> - Was or is a member of the **Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association**; <br> - At the **Hidden Valley Golf Resort** located on the designated Lands; <br> - Paid an annual maintenance fee during the eligible period, calculated based on the estimated cost of maintaining the resort, its lots, and additional facilities. |
| **Eligible Period** | The time frame from **October 1, 1992, to January 31, 1999**. This is the window during which the maintenance fees were paid and subject to remission. |
| **The Lands** | A specific parcel of land located in **Siksika Indian Reserve No. 146, Province of Alberta**, specifically: <br> - Sections 8, 9, and 16 of Township 21, Range 21, West of the 4th Meridian; <br> - Including road allowances between those sections. <br> The land is defined by a survey plan deposited in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** (Ottawa, file no. 59108) and a copy held in the **Land Titles Office at Calgary** (file no. 7510121). |

### **4. Scope of the Remission**

- The remission applies to **tax paid under Division II of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** during the eligible period.
- Specifically, it covers the **annual maintenance fees** paid by eligible claimants to the Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association.
- Importantly, **no tax was payable** on these fees at the time they were paid — meaning the fees were not subject to excise tax under the Act.

Thus, the remission **cancels or refunds** the tax that would have been due on these fees, even though the fees themselves were not taxed.

---

### **5. Conditions for the Remission**

To qualify for the remission, an eligible claimant must meet **two conditions**:

1. **Timely Application**  
   A **written application** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the Order is made.  
   - The Order was made in 1991 (as per the citation), so the two-year deadline would have been **1993** (by the end of 1993).  
   - *Note: This deadline is critical — applications made after this period would be ineligible.*

2. **No Prior Rebate, Credit, or Remission**  
   The amount of tax being claimed for remission **must not have already been**:
   - Rebated (a partial refund),
   - Credited (offset against future tax),
   - Or remitted (fully refunded) under:
     - The *Excise Tax Act*, or
     - The *Financial Administration Act*.

This prevents double remission and ensures fiscal accountability.

---

### **6. Public Interest Justification**
The Governor General in Council issued this order **"in the public interest"**, suggesting that:
- The remission serves a broader social or economic purpose (e.g., supporting Indigenous communities, recognizing historical or community-based arrangements),
- The maintenance fees were structured as community or residential fees, not commercial excise charges,
- Granting remission avoids unjust financial burden on individuals who were paying fees that were not subject to excise tax.

---

### **7. Practical Implications**

- **Who is affected?**  
  Individuals who were members of the Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association and paid annual maintenance fees between **October 1, 1992, and January 31, 1999**.

- **What benefit do they receive?**  
  A refund of the excise tax that would have been due on those fees — effectively a tax relief for individuals who paid fees that were not taxable.

- **How to apply?**  
  A formal, written application must be filed with the Minister of National Revenue within two years of the Order’s issuance.

- **Limitations**  
  - Only applies to fees paid during the eligible period.
  - Only applies if no prior tax relief was granted.
  - Only applies to individuals who were members of the Association at the resort on the Lands.

---

### **8. Legal and Administrative Significance**

- This is a **federal administrative order** under the Financial Administration Act, not a change to the Excise Tax Act itself.
- It demonstrates the government’s power to **correct or adjust tax liabilities** in specific, narrowly defined circumstances when it is in the public interest.
- It reflects a recognition of **community-based or Indigenous land-use arrangements**, where fees may be structured differently from standard commercial or retail taxes.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **targeted tax remission** to individuals who paid annual maintenance fees to the Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association during a specific period (1992–1999) on land within Siksika Indian Reserve No. 146. The remission is granted because no excise tax was originally payable on those fees, and it is considered in the public interest. However, eligibility is strictly limited by time (application within two years of the Order) and prior tax relief. It serves as a case study in how federal administrative powers can be used to address historical or community-specific financial arrangements.

**Summary in One Sentence:**  
The *Certain Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association Members Remission Order* allows eligible individuals who paid annual maintenance fees to the Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association between October 1, 1992, and January 31, 1999, to have excise tax on those fees remitted — provided they apply in writing within two years of the Order’s issuance and no prior tax relief was granted.
