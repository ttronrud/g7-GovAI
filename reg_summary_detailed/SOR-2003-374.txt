Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Regulation Summary:  
Organizations in the Province of Quebec Exemption Order (S.C. 2000, c. 5)**

---

#### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation establishes an **exemption** for certain organizations operating in the **Province of Quebec** from the application of **Part 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)** — specifically, the federal law governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information — **in respect of personal information processing activities that occur within Quebec**.

The exemption is granted because Quebec already has its own comprehensive personal information protection law, which is considered **substantially similar** to Part 1 of PIPEDA.

---

#### **2. Legal Basis**
- The Order is made under **paragraph 26(2)(b)** of the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*.
- It is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**.
- This means the federal government is formally recognizing that Quebec’s provincial law (R.S.Q., c. P-39.1) provides an equivalent level of protection to PIPEDA’s requirements in the private sector.

---

#### **3. Applicable Law in Quebec**
- The relevant provincial law is:  
  **An Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector**,  
  **R.S.Q., c. P-39.1** (commonly known as the *Quebec Personal Information Protection Act* or QPIPA).
- This law applies to organizations that meet specific criteria and operate within Quebec.

---

#### **4. Scope of the Exemption**
The exemption applies to:

- **Any organization** (other than a federal government body, federal work, or federal business)  
- That carries on an **enterprise** within the meaning of **Section 1525 of the Civil Code of Québec**  
- To which **R.S.Q., c. P-39.1 applies**

👉 This means the organization must:
- Be engaged in a commercial or business activity (as defined by Quebec law),
- Be subject to the Quebec personal information protection law (i.e., it is a private sector organization operating in Quebec),
- Not be a federal entity (such as a federal government department or a federally owned corporation).

---

#### **5. What Is Exempted?**
The exemption applies to the **collection, use, and disclosure of personal information** that occurs **within the Province of Quebec**.

- **Part 1 of PIPEDA** (which governs the federal rules on personal information) does **not apply** to these activities.
- However, the organization must still comply with **Quebec’s R.S.Q., c. P-39.1**, which provides the same level of protection and obligations in the private sector.

> ⚠️ Important: The exemption is **limited to activities occurring in Quebec**. If an organization processes personal information outside Quebec, or if it operates under federal jurisdiction, PIPEDA may still apply.

---

#### **6. Conditions for Application**
- The exemption is **only available to private sector organizations** operating in Quebec.
- It does **not apply to federal government entities**, federal enterprises, or federally regulated businesses.
- The organization must be **actively carrying on an enterprise** as defined under Quebec’s Civil Code (Section 1525), which typically includes commercial, service, or business activities involving the provision of goods or services.

---

#### **7. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette* (the official publication of federal laws).

> This ensures that the exemption becomes effective once formally published and recognized by the federal government.

---

#### **8. Key Implications**
- **No duplication of regulation**: This allows Quebec to maintain its own privacy regime without having to comply with both PIPEDA and its own law — reducing regulatory burden.
- **Legal consistency**: The exemption ensures that Quebec’s privacy law is treated as equivalent to PIPEDA in federal law, reinforcing the principle of **provincial autonomy** in privacy matters.
- **Compliance responsibility**: While PIPEDA does not apply, organizations must still adhere to Quebec’s R.S.Q., c. P-39.1, which includes requirements such as:
  - Notice to individuals,
  - Consent for data use,
  - Data minimization,
  - Security measures,
  - Individual access rights,
  - Accountability for data practices.

---

#### **9. Context and Background**
- This Order reflects the **federal recognition of Quebec’s strong and comparable privacy framework**.
- It was issued in **2000**, during a period when Canada was developing a national privacy framework, and provinces were being allowed to implement their own laws where they are substantially similar to federal standards.
- This is part of a broader trend in Canadian privacy law, where **provincial laws are recognized as equivalent** to federal ones under PIPEDA’s exemption provisions (e.g., under paragraph 26(2)(b)).

### ✅ Summary in One Sentence:
> The *Organizations in the Province of Quebec Exemption Order* (S.C. 2000, c. 5) exempts certain private-sector organizations operating in Quebec from the application of Part 1 of PIPEDA — specifically for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information — because Quebec’s own personal information protection law (R.S.Q., c. P-39.1) provides equivalent protections.

| Stakeholder | Key Point |
