**Detailed Summary of the Fredericton Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The **Fredericton Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. This establishes the legal foundation for regulating land use around Fredericton Airport in accordance with aviation safety and operational requirements.

These regulations are formally titled the **Fredericton Airport Zoning Regulations** and are binding on all relevant landowners and users within the designated area.

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulations define several critical terms:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to *Fredericton Airport*, located in the County of Sunbury, Province of New Brunswick.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed geographic point used as a central reference for measuring distances and elevations. It is located:
  - 500 feet southwesterly at right angles from the centerline of **runway 15–33**
  - 500 feet northwesterly at right angles from the centerline of **runway 09–27**
  - Coordinates: **N. 769,959.37 feet, E. 991,257.19 feet** (based on the New Brunswick Horizontal Control System)

- **Strip**: A rectangular area of the landing surface, including runways, designed for take-off and landing in a specific direction. Each strip has:
  - A **width of 1,000 feet** (500 feet on each side of the runway centerline)
  - A **length** of:
    - **7,400 feet** for runway 09–27 (with 200 feet extending beyond each end)
    - **6,400 feet** for runway 15–33 (with 200 feet extending beyond each end)

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a strip, designed to ensure aircraft can safely approach the runway without obstacles. Characteristics:
  - Slope: **1 foot vertically to 50 feet horizontally** (a 1:50 gradient)
  - Extends up to:
    - 1,000 feet vertically above the end of the strip
    - 50,000 feet horizontally from the end of the strip
  - Outer ends of the horizontal lines are **8,000 feet from the projected centerline** of the strip
  - Applies to approach ends of runways **09, 27, 15, and 33**

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its associated approach surfaces, rising to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. Characteristics:
  - Slope: **1 foot vertically to 7 feet horizontally** (a 1:7 gradient)
  - Extends outward and upward from the lateral limits of the strip and approach surfaces
  - Intersects with the outer surface or with another transitional surface of a neighboring strip

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary horizontal plane established at a constant elevation of **150 feet above the airport reference point (ARP)**. However:
  - If this elevation would place the surface **below 30 feet above ground level**, it is instead set at **30 feet above ground level** to ensure practicality and safety.

### **3. Applicable Area**

The regulations apply to all lands that fall within the following boundaries:

- Lands **within** the designated zones defined in the schedule
- Lands **directly beneath** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits of the airport

The **outer limits** of the regulated area are defined as:

- A **circular area with a radius of 13,000 feet**, centered at the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- **Exception**: If any part of **C.F.B. Gagetown** lies within this 13,000-foot radius, then the boundary of the regulated area becomes the **official boundary of C.F.B. Gagetown**, as shown on **Department of Public Works Plan No. S-352**

This ensures that military installations are not subject to the same zoning rules as civilian land, and that the boundaries respect existing military land use.

---

### **4. Prohibitions on Construction and Development**

No person may:
- **Erect, construct, or add to** any building, structure, or object on land subject to these regulations
- Where the **highest point** of such construction or addition would exceed the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:
  - The **approach surface**
  - The **outer surface**
  - The **transitional surface**

This restriction is designed to prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases—especially during low visibility or adverse weather conditions.

---

### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

If any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** of that land to:
- Remove or trim the excessive growth
- Ensure the land remains free from vegetation that could pose a hazard to aircraft

This provision allows for proactive management of vegetation that could interfere with flight operations.

---

### **6. Prohibition on Waste Disposal**

No owner or occupier of regulated land may:
- Use the land or any part of it for the **disposal or accumulation** of any **waste, material, or substance** that is:
  - **Edible by birds** or
  - **Attractive to birds**

This is a critical measure to reduce the risk of bird strikes—especially during takeoff and landing—where bird collisions can cause serious damage to aircraft and pose safety risks.

---

### **7. Visual and Operational Significance of the Plan**

All surfaces (approach, transitional, outer, and strips) are illustrated on **Department of Public Works Plans**:
- **S-352, S-352A, S-352B, and S-352C**, dated **July 20, 1977**
- These plans were prepared for the **Department of Transport** and serve as the official reference for the spatial layout and elevation boundaries

These maps are essential for:
- Land development planning
- Zoning compliance
- Environmental assessments
- Aviation safety audits

---

### **8. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**: To ensure that aircraft can safely approach, land, and take off without encountering obstacles or hazards.
2. **Obstruction Control**: To prevent structures, trees, or debris from interfering with flight paths.
3. **Environmental Protection**: To minimize bird activity near the airport by prohibiting food sources or attractive materials.
4. **Clear Regulatory Boundaries**: To define precise spatial and elevation limits, enabling consistent enforcement and planning.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Issue directions regarding removal of excessive vegetation
  - Monitor compliance with the zoning rules
- Violations may result in enforcement actions, including fines or orders to demolish or remove structures

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Fredericton Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for land use around Fredericton Airport. By defining clear spatial boundaries, elevation limits, and prohibited activities, the regulations protect aviation safety, maintain operational efficiency, and prevent environmental hazards such as bird strikes.

These rules are grounded in aviation engineering standards and are designed to balance public land use with the critical need for safe and uninterrupted air traffic operations at a regional airport.

---

**Key Takeaway**:  
Any development, structure, or vegetation within or near Fredericton Airport must conform strictly to the elevation and spatial boundaries defined by the approach, transitional, and outer surfaces. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by the Minister of Transport.
