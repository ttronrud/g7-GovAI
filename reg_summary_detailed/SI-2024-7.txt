**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada, under **subsection 20(1) and (3) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**, approves amendments to the application of the Act in two key respects:

---

### **1. Re-Application of the Public Service Employment Act to Positions Excluded Under Order in Council P.C. 1967-444**

- **Background:**  
  In 1967, through **Order in Council P.C. 1967-444**, the Government of Canada excluded certain public service positions from the application of the Public Service Employment Act. This exclusion was intended to allow flexibility in staffing and employment conditions for specific roles, possibly due to unique operational or administrative needs at the time.

- **Action Taken:**  
  The current regulation **re-applies** the provisions of the Public Service Employment Act to those previously excluded positions, effective as of the date of the regulation’s approval (November 21, 2023).

- **Scope of Re-Application:**  
  The re-application covers:
  - All **positions** that were previously excluded under Order in Council P.C. 1967-444.
  - All **persons currently occupying** those positions.

- **Implications:**  
  - These individuals and roles will now be subject to the full scope of the Public Service Employment Act, including provisions related to:
    - Employment terms and conditions
    - Promotion and career development
    - Compensation and benefits
    - Disciplinary procedures
    - Job security and rights
    - Public service standards and accountability
  - This means that the standard employment framework for the federal public service now applies to these roles, restoring consistency and oversight across the public service.

### **2. Exclusion of Certain Foreign-Appointed Employees from the Public Service Employment Act**

- **Background:**  
  The Public Service Commission (PSC) has determined that it is **neither practicable nor in the best interests of the public service** to apply the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act to individuals who:
  - Are **appointed and employed outside Canada**, and
  - Are performing duties **directly related to diplomatic or consular operations** or **military support units** of the Government of Canada located abroad,
  - And are **subject to the laws of the host country** where they are employed.

- **Action Taken:**  
  The regulation **excludes** such individuals from the application of the Public Service Employment Act.

- **Scope of Exclusion:**  
  Applies to:
  - **Diplomatic staff** (e.g., ambassadors, consuls, embassy personnel)
  - **Consular officers**
  - **Military support personnel** (e.g., logistics, intelligence, or technical support staff working with Canadian Armed Forces units abroad)
  - Individuals who are **employed under the jurisdiction of foreign laws** (i.e., their employment is governed by the laws of the host country, not Canadian law)

- **Rationale:**  
  - These roles operate in **foreign jurisdictions** where employment is governed by international agreements, host country laws, and diplomatic immunity.
  - Applying Canadian employment standards (e.g., disciplinary processes, pay scales, promotion rules) could conflict with:
    - International law
    - Diplomatic or military operational requirements
    - Host country legal frameworks
  - The PSC concluded that applying the PSEA in such cases would create **practical difficulties** and **undermine operational effectiveness**.

- **Consultation Requirement:**  
  Under subsection 20(2) of the Public Service Employment Act, the Commission **consulted with the employer** (typically the Department or agency responsible for the role) prior to making this exclusion. This ensures that the decision is informed by operational realities and stakeholder input.

---

### **Key Legal Basis**

The regulation is grounded in **subsection 20(1)** and **(3)** of the *Public Service Employment Act*:

- **Subsection 20(1):** Empowers the Public Service Commission to determine, in the public interest, whether certain provisions of the Act should be applied to specific positions or individuals.
- **Subsection 20(3):** Requires the Commission to consult with the employer before making such determinations, ensuring transparency and accountability.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulation is effective as of **November 21, 2023**, the date of its issuance in Gatineau, Quebec.

---

### **Significance and Impact**

| Aspect | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Consistency in Public Service Standards** | Restores uniformity by applying the PSEA to previously excluded positions, enhancing fairness and transparency across the federal public service. |
| **Operational Flexibility for Diplomats & Military Support Staff** | Recognizes the unique nature of international assignments, allowing these employees to operate under host country laws and international norms. |
| **Public Service Accountability** | Reinforces accountability through standard employment rules, while respecting the exceptional nature of diplomatic and military operations. |
| **Legal Clarity** | Provides clear, legally binding guidance on which employees are subject to the PSEA and which are exempt due to international obligations. |

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **balanced and pragmatic approach** to public service employment governance. It:

- **Reinstates the full application of the Public Service Employment Act** to positions that were previously excluded, promoting consistency and fairness within the public service.
- **Maintains necessary flexibility** for individuals serving in diplomatic, consular, or military support roles abroad by excluding them from the Act’s provisions, recognizing the constraints imposed by international law and operational realities.

This decision reflects a careful balance between **public service accountability** and **operational necessity**, ensuring that the federal public service remains both equitable and effective in its global responsibilities.
