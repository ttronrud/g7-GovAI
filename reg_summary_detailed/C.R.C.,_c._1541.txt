**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Withdrawal of Certain Lands (South Nahanni River N.W.T.) from Disposal Order, 1972*

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
This regulation serves to permanently withdraw a specific parcel of land in the **Northwest Territories (N.W.T.)** from all potential disposal under the *Territorial Lands Act*. The primary purpose is to **designate the land as a national park**, thereby protecting it from mineral extraction, development, or private ownership.

The order is issued under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act*, which allows for the withdrawal of land from disposal for public purposes such as conservation, recreation, or environmental protection.

### **2. Legal Effect of the Order**
- **Withdrawal from Disposal**: All lands described in the schedule are formally removed from the category of land available for sale, lease, or other forms of private or commercial disposal.
- **Appropriation for National Park Use**: The designated lands are set apart and **appropriated specifically for use as a national park**. This means the land is legally reserved for public enjoyment, conservation, and ecological protection.
- **Inclusion of All Interests**: The withdrawal includes not only surface rights but also:
  - All **mines and mineral rights**
  - All **easements**
  - All **servitudes**
  - All other **interests in real property** associated with the parcel

This ensures that no future mining, logging, or development activities can occur on the land without explicit government authorization.

### **3. Geographic Description of the Lands**
The parcel is located **along the South Nahanni River** in the Northwest Territories and is described in a detailed, topographically precise manner using survey monuments and map references.

#### **Map and Survey References**:
- Primary reference: **First edition of The Twisted Mountain map sheet (95G/4)** at a scale of **1:50,000**, produced by the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (now Natural Resources Canada).
- Supporting maps:
  - **Flat River map sheet (95E)**
  - **Virginia Falls map sheet (95F)**
  - **Sibbeston Lake map sheet (95G)**
  - **Glacier Lake map sheet (95L)**
- All maps are at a scale of **1:250,000**, produced by the Army Survey Establishment, R.C.E. (Royal Canadian Engineers), Ottawa.

These references ensure that the boundaries are based on authoritative and standardized topographic data.

   - Southeasterly to 61°13′00″N, 124°00′00″W
   - Easterly back to the **point of commencement**

All coordinates are **geodetic**, referenced to the **1927 North American Datum**, ensuring consistency with historical survey standards.

### **5. Area and Size**
- The total area of the withdrawn parcel is approximately **1,840 square miles** (about 4,760 square kilometers).
- This vast expanse includes rugged mountain terrain, river valleys, and high-elevation peaks, reflecting a diverse and ecologically significant landscape.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order becomes effective as of **February 22, 1972**.
- All provisions of the withdrawal and appropriation take effect from this date, and the land is legally protected from future disposal.

---

### **7. Significance and Context**
- This regulation represents an early step in the Canadian government’s efforts to establish and protect **natural heritage areas** in the N.W.T.
- The South Nahanni River region is known for its **biodiversity, pristine wilderness, and significant geological features**, including the prominent **Twisted Mountain** and the **Hole-in-the-Wall Creek watershed**.
- The area is now part of the **South Nahanni National Park Reserve**, which was later formally established under the *National Parks Act* and is recognized as a protected area of national importance.

---

### **8. Key Implications**
- **Environmental Protection**: Prevents industrial exploitation (mining, logging, drilling) in a sensitive ecological zone.
- **Cultural and Recreational Value**: Preserves the landscape for scientific study, outdoor recreation, and Indigenous cultural heritage (though Indigenous rights and land use in the area are not explicitly addressed in this order).
- **Legal Precedent**: Establishes a model for future withdrawals of land for national park purposes under the *Territorial Lands Act*.

---

### **Conclusion**
This 1972 Order is a foundational legal instrument that permanently protects a large and ecologically significant area along the South Nahanni River in the Northwest Territories. By withdrawing the land from disposal and designating it as a national park, the government ensures the conservation of its natural features, supports environmental sustainability, and establishes a legal framework for future park management and public access.

It remains a key reference in the administrative history of Canada’s national parks and reflects early federal commitment to wilderness preservation in northern Canada.
