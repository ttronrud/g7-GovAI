### 3. **Applicable Legislation**
The Agreement applies to specific laws in both countries:

#### ✅ Canada:
- *Old Age Security Act (OAS)* and its regulations
- *Canada Pension Plan (CPP)* and its regulations

#### ✅ Brazil:
- General social security regime
- Social security regimes for civil servants (age, disability, survivor pensions)

> 🔁 **Extension Clause**: The Agreement also applies to **amendments, supplements, consolidations, or replacements** of these laws — **unless** the Party notifies the other within **three months of entry into force** that the changes do *not* apply.

> 🚫 **Exclusion Clause**: New laws that extend coverage to new categories of beneficiaries or new benefits **do not apply** unless both parties agree in writing.

---

### 4. **Who Is Covered?**
The Agreement applies to:
- Individuals who have **resided or worked** in either country.
- Individuals who **acquire rights** from someone who was previously covered under either country’s legislation.

> 🌍 **Key Principle**: A person who has been subject to one country’s legislation is **eligible for benefits under the other country’s system**, under the **same conditions as a citizen of that country**.

> 💡 Example: A Brazilian citizen who works in Canada and accumulates CPP contributions can later claim a Canadian pension, and vice versa.

---

### 5. **Non-Reduction of Benefits**
- **Benefits under either country’s legislation shall not be reduced, suspended, or canceled solely because the person resides in the other country.**
- Benefits are payable **even when the person resides in a third country**.

> ⚠️ Exception: For Canada, **Old Age Security (OAS) pensions and Guaranteed Income Supplements (GIS)** are only payable **outside Canada** to the extent allowed by the *Old Age Security Act*.

---

### 6. **Residency and Work Rules (Article 6–8)**
These rules determine which country’s social security system applies to a person based on their employment or residence.

| Scenario | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Employed person working in a Party’s territory** | Subject only to that Party’s legislation. |
| **Self-employed person working in the other Party** | Subject only to the legislation of the **first Party** (where they reside). |
| **Employee sent temporarily to the other Party** | Subject only to the legislation of the **first Party**, for up to **60 months** (maximum duration). |
| **Public servant/government employee sent abroad** | Subject only to the legislation of the **first Party**. |
| **Person working for the other Party in government employment** | Subject only to the legislation of the first Party. |

> 📝 **Exception**: The Parties may, by mutual written agreement, **make exceptions** to these rules for specific individuals or categories — provided the person is subject to one Party’s legislation.

---

### 7. **Periods of Coverage: Totalization (Article 11)**
This is a **core feature** of the Agreement — allowing individuals to **combine periods of contribution** from both countries when determining eligibility for pensions.

#### A. **For OAS (Canada)**:
- A period of coverage under **Brazil’s legislation** during residence in Brazil counts as **residence in Canada**.
- This applies to the person and their **spouse/common-law partner and dependants** (if not covered by Brazil due to employment/self-employment).

> ✅ Example: A Canadian citizen living in Brazil for 5 years and contributing to Brazil’s pension system can count those years as residence in Canada for OAS eligibility.

#### B. **For CPP (Canada)**:
- A calendar year in which the person had **at least 3 months of coverage under Brazil’s system** counts as **one year of CPP coverage**.

> ✅ Example: 3 months in Brazil → 1 year of CPP coverage.

#### C. **For Brazil’s Old Age Benefits**:
- A calendar year of **CPP coverage** counts as **12 months of Brazil coverage**.
- A month of **OAS coverage in Canada** (not overlapping with CPP) counts as **1 month of Brazil coverage**.

> ✅ Example: 1 year of CPP coverage = 12 months of Brazil coverage.

#### D. **For Disability/Death Benefits (Brazil)**:
- A calendar year of CPP coverage = 12 months of Brazil coverage.

#### E. **Totalization Rules (if not eligible based on periods)**:
- If no eligibility under the Parties’ laws, totalize periods from **third countries** where both Parties have reciprocal agreements allowing period totalization — **but only if they do not overlap**.
- If only Brazil has such an agreement, then only Brazil’s totalization applies.

> ⚠️ **No double counting**: If both Parties apply totalization, periods are not counted twice.

---

### 8. **Benefit Amount Calculations**

#### A. **For Canada (OAS/GIS)**:
- If a person is eligible **only through totalization**, the amount is calculated as:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based on CPP pensionable earnings.
  - **Flat-rate portion**: Pro-rated using the formula:
    >  
    > (Flat-rate portion under CPP) × (Ratio of CPP contributions / Minimum qualifying period)  
    >  
    > But **never exceeds 100%**.

> 🔍 Example: A person has 10 years of CPP contributions (out of 40 needed). The flat-rate portion is reduced proportionally.

#### B. **For Brazil (Old Age Pension)**:
- If eligible **only through totalization**:
  1. Calculate the **theoretical amount** of pension if all periods were completed under Brazil’s system.
  2. Apply a **reduction factor** based on actual coverage vs. total coverage (but not below minimum eligibility).
  3. **Minimum guarantee** applies: the benefit **cannot fall below the minimum required** under Brazilian law.

> ✅ Ensures that even under partial coverage, individuals receive a **basic floor of protection**.
