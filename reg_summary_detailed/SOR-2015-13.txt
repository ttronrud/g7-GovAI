### **Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation was issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**. It is grounded in specific provisions of the *Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 12* — namely, **Sections 130, 133, and 135**.

These sections likely relate to economic policy measures, such as adjustments in public spending, fiscal measures, or regulatory timelines, designed to support economic stability and growth. The specific purpose of the Order is to **designate a particular date** (a "day") for the application or implementation of those sections.

### **Key Provision of the Order**

> **The day for the purposes of Sections 130, 133, and 135 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 12 is fixed as June 1, 2018.**

This means that:
- All provisions in Sections 130, 133, and 135 of the Act will be interpreted, applied, or triggered **from June 1, 2018**.
- This date serves as a critical benchmark for compliance, reporting, or implementation timelines under those sections.
- For example, it may define when certain financial obligations, policy changes, or reporting requirements begin or take effect.

### **Effective Date of the Order**

The regulation specifies two conditions for when it comes into force:

1. **Primary Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the **first day on which both Sections 114 and 115 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11 are in force**.  
   - This suggests that the Order is dependent on the operation of earlier provisions of the same Act (specifically Sections 114 and 115), which may govern procedural or transitional rules.
   - These sections may establish conditions for the operation of the economic plan, such as eligibility criteria, funding mechanisms, or implementation timelines.

2. **Fallback Effective Date (if registered later):**  
   If the Order is **registered (officially published and recognized)** after the date when Sections 114 and 115 come into force, then it will take effect on the **day it is registered**.

This structure ensures that the Order only becomes active when the relevant enabling provisions of the Act are already in operation, preventing premature or inconsistent application.

### **Note on Enforcement and Legal Status**

- The Order is formally registered in the *Statutes of Canada*, 2014, Chapter 20 (S.C. 2014, c. 20).
- It was **not immediately effective** upon publication in 2014 due to the conditional effective date.
- It **came into force on February 11, 2015**, as noted in the official note (SI/2015-5), which is the date of its official registration and enforcement in the legal system.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- Provide **clarity and certainty** regarding the implementation date of key economic policy provisions.
- Ensure **timely and consistent application** of the economic measures outlined in the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act.
- Align the implementation of Sections 130, 133, and 135 with broader fiscal and economic planning timelines, with June 1, 2018, serving as a key milestone.

This date (June 1, 2018) may have been chosen to:
- Align with fiscal year-end reporting cycles.
- Allow for preparation by government agencies, health providers, or other stakeholders.
- Facilitate monitoring and evaluation of the economic policy's impact.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **transitional and procedural instrument** that establishes a definitive date (June 1, 2018) for the operation of three specific sections of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act. It ensures that these provisions are activated only when the necessary enabling conditions (Sections 114 and 115) are in place, and it comes into force on the earliest of those conditions or upon registration. The Order is legally binding and serves as a key component in the execution of the government’s economic strategy under the 2014 Act.

> **In short:**  
> The Order fixes June 1, 2018, as the key implementation date for Sections 130, 133, and 135 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, and it becomes effective when Sections 114 and 115 of the same Act are in force — or on the day of registration if later. It was formally in force on February 11, 2015.
