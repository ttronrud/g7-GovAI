**Detailed Summary of the Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2017)**

---

**Issuance and Legal Authority**  
The Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2017) was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. This action is authorized under **subsection 117.14(1)a of the Criminal Code** of Canada (R.S.C., c. C-46, as amended by S.C. 1995, c. 39, s. 139). This provision allows the government to declare an amnesty period for certain individuals who are in possession of firearms under specific conditions.

---

**Definition of Key Terms**  
- **Non-restricted firearm**: A firearm that is *not* a prohibited firearm or a restricted firearm.  
  - This means the firearm is legally owned under the firearms licensing system, but it does not fall into the more strictly regulated categories (e.g., handguns, certain types of rifles or shotguns deemed high-risk).

---

**Scope of the Amnesty Period**  
The amnesty period is specifically designed for individuals who:
1. At any time during the period, are in possession of a **non-restricted firearm**, and  
2. Hold or previously held a **firearms licence** (either a licence to possess firearms or a licence to possess and acquire firearms) that:
   - **Expired during the period from January 1, 2004, to May 16, 2017**, *or*  
   - **Expires during the period from May 17, 2017, to December 31, 2017**.

This means the amnesty applies to people whose licences have lapsed due to expiry during a defined window, and who are still in possession of a non-restricted firearm.

---

**Purpose of the Amnesty Period**  
The primary objective of this amnesty is to provide a legal and safe pathway for individuals to:
- **Obtain a new firearms licence** (i.e., renew or apply for a licence after the expiry period),  
- **Deactivate the firearm** (render it non-functional, e.g., by removing the trigger mechanism or disabling it in a way that complies with legal standards),  
- **Export the firearm** in full compliance with all applicable Canadian and foreign laws (including export regulations of the destination country),  
- **Turn in the firearm** to a police officer or a firearms officer for destruction or other lawful disposal,  
- **Sell or give the firearm** to:
  - A **public service agency** (as defined in section 1 of the *Public Agents Firearms Regulations*),  
  - A **business** (such as a museum or private collector) that holds a valid licence to acquire firearms, or  
  - An **individual** who holds a valid licence to possess and acquire firearms,  
- **Possess the firearm** temporarily *before* completing one of the above actions (e.g., to facilitate transfer or export).

This flexibility is intended to reduce the risk of illegal firearm possession and to support lawful disposal or transfer without criminal liability.

---

**Timeline of the Amnesty Period**  
- The amnesty period **begins on May 17, 2017**, and  
- **Ends on December 31, 2017**.

This 7-month window was strategically chosen to allow individuals time to respond to the conditions, while also ensuring the amnesty does not extend beyond a reasonable timeframe.

---

**Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the day it is officially **registered** (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette), which is typically within a few days of its issuance. This ensures legal enforceability once formally recognized by the government.

---

**Key Implications and Intent**  
- The amnesty is **not a blanket forgiveness** of past offences. It applies only to individuals who are in possession of a non-restricted firearm and whose licences have expired within the specified periods.  
- It does **not apply** to prohibited or restricted firearms, nor to individuals who have committed offences related to firearms (such as illegal possession or trafficking).  
- It serves as a **practical tool** to address gaps in licensing compliance, reduce unlicensed firearm holdings, and promote responsible firearm management.  
- It reflects a balance between public safety and individual rights, allowing people to legally resolve issues related to expired licences without facing criminal charges.

**Conclusion**  
The Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2017) provides a structured, lawful, and time-bound opportunity for individuals with expired firearms licences to resolve their firearm possession status in a safe and compliant manner. By enabling the reactivation of licences, deactivation, export, or lawful transfer of non-restricted firearms, the amnesty supports both public safety and individual accountability within Canada’s firearms regulatory framework. It is a targeted, temporary measure designed to address a specific regulatory gap arising from licence expirations between 2004 and 2017.
