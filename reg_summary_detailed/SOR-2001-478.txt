## 📚 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* (ICA). |
| **Balance sheet value** | The value of shares or ownership interests reported on an **unconsolidated basis** in a company’s balance sheet. This is the key metric used for financial assessments. |
| **Book value** | **Repealed** by SOR/2008-168, section 17. No longer applicable. |
| **Specialized financing entity of the insurance holding company** | An entity that is: <br> - Controlled by the insurance holding company, or <br> - In which the insurance holding company has a **substantial investment**. |
| **Subsidiary** | In the context of an insurance holding company, **does not include** a specialized financing entity. This creates a distinction in corporate structure. |

> ⚠️ **Important Clarification**:  
> For the purpose of **subsection 490(1)** of the ICA (as applied under subsection 966(1)), a *specialized financing entity* is defined as an entity that acquires or holds shares/ownership interests in entities that a **life company** may acquire control of or increase a substantial investment in under **subsection 493(4)** of the Act.  
> This definition ties the scope of these regulations to the types of entities a life insurer can engage with.

## 🎯 Scope of the Regulations

These regulations apply specifically to:
- The **ownership** by an **insurance holding company** of shares or ownership interests in a **specialized financing entity** under **paragraph 971(2)(b)** of the Insurance Companies Act.

This means the rules govern how insurance holding companies can invest in or control specialized financing entities — entities that provide financing services — and impose strict limits on such activities to ensure financial stability and prevent systemic risk.

## 🚫 Prohibitions and Restrictions

An insurance holding company **shall not** acquire or hold control of, or increase a substantial investment in, a specialized financing entity **if any of the following conditions are met**:

---

### 🔹 Condition 1: Debt-to-Asset Ratio Threshold
> The **outstanding debt obligations** (excluding those payable to the insurance holding company or entities it controls) of the specialized financing entity and any entities it controls must **not exceed twice** the sum of:
> 1. The **excess of assets over liabilities** of the specialized financing entity (on an unconsolidated balance sheet basis), and  
> 2. The **value of non-controlling interests** in the specialized financing entity (on a **consolidated** balance sheet basis).

📌 **Purpose**: Prevents excessive leverage in specialized financing entities, which could lead to financial instability if those entities face losses.

---

### 🔹 Condition 2: Prohibited Business Activities
The specialized financing entity **shall not** control or hold interests in any entity that:
- Is primarily engaged in **leasing motor vehicles in Canada** for the purpose of **extending credit** or financing a customer’s acquisition of a vehicle;  
- Provides **temporary possession** of personal property (including motor vehicles) for purposes **other than financing** the purchase;  
- Acts as an **insurance broker or agent** in Canada.

📌 **Purpose**: Prevents conflicts of interest and ensures that specialized financing entities do not engage in activities that blur the lines between insurance, leasing, and brokerage — which could expose the insurance holding company to regulatory or reputational risk.

---

### 🔹 Condition 3: Aggregate Ownership Threshold
The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests (excluding those held by the specialized financing entity in another specialized financing entity it controls) held by:
- The insurance holding company,  
- Its subsidiaries,  
- The specialized financing entity,  
- And other specialized financing entities of the insurance holding company,  

in an entity **controlled or substantially invested in by** the specialized financing entity,  
**must not exceed $250 million**.

📌 **Purpose**: Limits the scale of exposure to a single entity through indirect ownership, reducing concentration risk.

---

### 🔹 Condition 4: Regulatory Capital Thresholds

#### (a) **10% Regulatory Capital Limit**
The sum of the following **must not exceed 10%** of the insurance holding company’s **regulatory capital**:
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests the insurance holding company and its subsidiaries would acquire in the specialized financing entity;  
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests held by the insurance holding company and its subsidiaries in the specialized financing entities of the insurance holding company;  
- The aggregate value of **outstanding loans** made by the insurance holding company and its subsidiaries to the specialized financing entities of the insurance holding company.

#### (b) **25% Regulatory Capital Limit**
The sum of the following **must not exceed 25%** of the insurance holding company’s **regulatory capital**:
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests held by the insurance holding company and its subsidiaries in:  
  - The specialized financing entity;  
  - Entities controlled by the specialized financing entity;  
  - Entities in which the specialized financing entity holds a substantial investment.  
- The aggregate value of **outstanding loans** made by the insurance holding company and its subsidiaries to:  
  - The specialized financing entity;  
  - Entities controlled by it;  
  - Entities in which it holds a substantial investment.

📌 **Purpose**: These thresholds protect the insurance holding company’s capital base from being overexposed to financing entities and their associated risks. They ensure that such investments remain within safe, manageable limits.

## ⏳ Long-Term Holding Restrictions

An insurance holding company **shall not** hold control of or a substantial investment in a specialized financing entity **if**:
- Either the specialized financing entity, or the specialized financing entity and **one or more of the following entities**, have held control of or a substantial investment in an entity (other than those described in the above prohibitions) for **more than 13 consecutive years**:
  - The insurance holding company itself;  
  - Any other specialized financing entity of the insurance holding company.

> ✅ **Exception**:  
> A specialized financing entity that **previously held control** of or a substantial investment in an entity **before becoming** a specialized financing entity is **not counted** toward this 13-year limit.

📌 **Purpose**: Prevents long-term, entrenched exposure to certain types of financing activities that could become outdated or risky over time. This promotes diversification and limits the risk of "zombie" or stagnant investments.

---

## 🚫 Exclusions from Other Provisions

These regulations **exclude** certain provisions of the ICA from applying to transactions governed by these rules:

- **Subsection 971(4)** of the ICA (which may relate to certain types of investments or acquisitions) **does not apply** when the insurance holding company acquires or increases its investment in an entity **through a specialized financing entity**.
- **Subsections 971(5) and (6)** of the ICA (which may involve reporting or disclosure requirements) **do not apply** in such cases.

📌 **Purpose**: Provides regulatory flexibility to allow insurance holding companies to use specialized financing entities as a vehicle for investment without triggering more stringent disclosure or procedural requirements.

## 📌 Key Objectives of the Regulations

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Financial Stability** | Limits leverage, debt levels, and capital exposure to prevent insolvency risk. |
| **Risk Diversification** | Prevents over-concentration in a single type of financing activity or entity. |
| **Anti-Conflicts of Interest** | Prohibits involvement in leasing, temporary possession, or insurance brokering — activities that could create conflicts with insurance operations. |
| **Capital Protection** | Ensures that regulatory capital is preserved for core insurance operations. |
| **Transparency & Accountability** | Uses clear, measurable thresholds (e.g., $250M, 10% of capital) to ensure oversight. |

## 📝 Practical Implications for Insurance Holding Companies

1. **Due Diligence Required**:
   - Before investing in a specialized financing entity, companies must assess:
     - Debt levels and asset-liability ratios;
     - Business activities of the entity and its affiliates;
     - Total ownership and loan exposures;
     - Long-term history of ownership.

2. **Capital Management**:
   - Must monitor and report on capital exposure to specialized financing entities to stay within 10% and 25% thresholds.

3. **Structural Design**:
   - Insurance holding companies must avoid creating ownership chains that exceed $250 million in aggregate balance sheet value.
   - Must avoid long-term (over 1
