- **Canada’s Term:**  
  "Minister of National Health and Welfare"

---

### 3. **Amendment to War Service and Equivalent Periods (Article 4, Paragraph 4)**
- **Deleted Original Paragraph 4**  
- **New Paragraph Added:**  
  > *"As regards Austrian legislation concerning the crediting of periods of war service and periods considered as equivalent, Canadian nationals who were Austrian nationals immediately before 13 March 1938 shall receive equal treatment with Austrian nationals."*

> ✅ *Purpose:* Ensures that Canadian citizens who were Austrian nationals before the 1938 Anschluss (union of Austria with Nazi Germany) are treated equally under Austrian rules for crediting war service or equivalent periods.

---

### 4. **Amendment to Compensatory Supplement (Article 5, Paragraph 3)**
- **Deleted Original Paragraph 3**  
- **New Paragraph Added:**  
  > *"As regards Austrian legislation, paragraph (1) of this Article shall not apply to the compensatory supplement."*

> ✅ *Purpose:* Excludes the compensatory supplement (a type of benefit for specific circumstances) from the general rule that coverage periods must be combined. This means that compensatory supplements are calculated independently of combined coverage.

---

### 5. **Clarification of Jurisdiction for Work-Based Coverage (Article 6)**
- **Deleted Original Article 6**  
- **New Article 6:**  
  > *"Subject to the provisions of Articles 7 to 9, an employed or self-employed person who works in the territory of one Party shall, in respect of that work, be subject only to the legislation of that Party. In the case of an employed person, this shall also apply if the employer’s place of business is in the territory of the other Party."*

> ✅ *Purpose:* Establishes clear jurisdictional rules — work performed in one country is governed solely by that country’s social security laws, even if the employer is based in the other country.

---

### 6. **Extension of Coverage Periods in Article 7 (Paragraphs 1 & 2)**
- **"Twenty-four" replaced by "Sixty"** in both paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 7.

> ✅ *Purpose:* Increases the maximum number of years during which a person may be considered for coverage under the social security system — from 24 to 60 years — which improves long-term coverage eligibility.

---

### 7. **New Paragraph (3) in Article 7 – Residency-Based Coverage for Self-Employed**
- **Newly Inserted Paragraph:**  
  > *"A person who would otherwise be compulsorily covered under the legislation of both Parties with respect to self-employment and who is a resident of one Party shall be subject only to the legislation of the Party of which that person is a resident."*

> ✅ *Purpose:* Prevents double coverage for self-employed individuals who reside in one country. Residency determines which country's law governs their coverage.

---

### 8. **Exceptional Cases for Benefit Determination (Article 9)**
- **Deleted Original Article 9**  
- **New Article 9:**  
  > *"At the request of an employed person and his employer or of a self-employed person, the competent authorities of the two Parties may provide, by agreement with one another, exceptions in the application of Articles 6 to 8, taking into account the nature and circumstances of the work."*

> ✅ *Purpose:* Allows flexibility in cases where work conditions (e.g., cross-border employment, temporary assignments) make strict application of jurisdictional rules impractical. Requires mutual agreement and justification.

---

### 9. **Revised Rules for Benefit Calculation (Article 12)**
- **Deleted Original Article 12**  
- **New Article 12:**  
  > *Periods of coverage under Canadian legislation are accepted as follows:*
> - A **calendar year** under the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** is accepted as **12 months** of contributions under Austrian law.
> - A **calendar month** with **at least 15 days** of coverage under the **Old Age Security Act (OASA)** and not part of a CPP period is accepted as **one month** of coverage under Austrian law.

> ✅ *Purpose:* Enables better integration of Canadian contributions into Austrian benefit calculations, particularly for CPP and OASA coverage.

### 10. **Benefit Determination Based on Coverage (Article 13)**
- **Deleted Original Article 13**  
- **New Article 13:**  
  > *If entitlement exists under Austrian law without Article 11 (i.e., without combining coverage), benefits are calculated based solely on Austrian coverage.*
>  
> *If entitlement exists only via Article 11 (combined coverage):*
> - Benefits not dependent on duration are calculated **proportionally** to the ratio of coverage periods to a 30-year baseline, but **not exceeding full amount**.
> - For invalidity or survivors’ benefits, periods after the contingency are taken into account **only proportionally** to the ratio of coverage to **two-thirds of the time between age 16 and the event**, capped at full period.
>  
> **Exclusions:**
> - Benefits from supplementary insurance
> - Means-tested benefits (to ensure minimum income)
>  
> **No benefit if total coverage is less than 12 months and no entitlement exists under Austrian law alone.**

> ✅ *Purpose:* Provides a fair, transparent, and proportionate method for calculating benefits, with clear caps and exclusions to prevent overpayment.

---

### 11. **Totalization of Coverage from Third States (Article 15 – New Addition)**
- **Inserted as new Article 15 (after the title of Part III):**
> *If a person is not entitled to a benefit based on combined coverage under both countries (Article 11), entitlement is determined by adding:*
> - Periods of coverage under both Canada and Austria, **plus**
> - Periods of coverage under a **third country** with which Canada has a social security agreement that allows totalization of periods.

> **Exception:**  
> *If the total duration of coverage under Canadian law is less than 12 months and no benefit exists under Canadian law alone, Canada is not required to pay benefits under this agreement.*

> ✅ *Purpose:* Expands access to benefits by allowing totalization with third countries (e.g., Germany, France, etc.), ensuring individuals with cross-border work histories are not excluded.

---

### 12. **Pension and Spouse’s Allowance Calculations (Article 16 – Revised)**
- **Deleted Original Paragraphs (2) to (4)**  
- **New Paragraphs (2) and (3):**
> *If a person is entitled to a pension or spouse’s allowance solely through Article 11 or Article 15:*
> - The amount is calculated **exclusively** based on **residence in Canada** under the **Old Age Security Act (OASA)**.
> - This applies even if the person has not resided in Canada long enough to qualify for a full pension under OASA.
>  
> **Conditions for Payment Outside Canada:**
> - An **Old Age Security (OAS) pension** may be paid **only if** total coverage (combined under Article 11 and Article 15) equals or exceeds the **minimum residency requirement** in Canada.
> - A **spouse’s allowance** or **Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)** is paid **only to the extent permitted by OASA**.

> ✅ *Purpose:* Ensures that benefits are tied to residency and coverage, and that payments outside Canada are conditional on meeting minimum thresholds.
