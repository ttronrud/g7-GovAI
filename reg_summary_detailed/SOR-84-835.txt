**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Turkey Marketing Levies Order (October 23, 1984)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Manitoba Turkey Marketing Levies Order*, issued on October 23, 1984, establishes a regulatory framework under which turkey producers in Manitoba are required to pay levies to the **Manitoba Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board (the Board)**. This Order is enacted pursuant to **Section 4 of the Manitoba Turkey Order, C.R.C., c. 160**, and is further authorized by the **Natural Products Marketing Act (Manitoba)**.

The primary purpose of this Order is to **fix, impose, and collect levies** on turkeys marketed in interprovincial or export trade, ensuring that producers contribute to the marketing, promotion, and support of the province’s turkey industry.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act (Manitoba)*, which provides the legal foundation for the Board’s authority to establish and administer marketing levies.
- **Board**: The *Manitoba Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board*, a statutory body created under the Act to oversee the marketing and economic development of turkey in Manitoba.
- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the **raising or keeping of turkeys** within the province of Manitoba.
- **Turkey**: A turkey of any variety, grade, or class that is raised or kept specifically for **slaughter** in Manitoba.

### **Core Provisions**

#### 1. **Levy Rate**
- Every producer must pay a levy of **one and one-half cents ($0.015) per kilogram of live weight** on all turkeys that are marketed through **interprovincial or export channels**.
- This levy is calculated based on the **live weight** of the turkey at the time of sale and applies only to turkeys sold outside Manitoba.

#### 2. **Payment Deadline**
- Producers must pay the levies to the Board **no later than seven days after the last day of the week** in which the turkeys were sold.
- For example, if turkeys are sold on a Monday, the levy must be paid by the following Monday.

#### 3. **Deduction and Payment by Purchaser (Optional Mechanism)**
- The levy may be **deducted from the purchase price** paid by the buyer (purchaser) of the turkey.
- The purchaser is then responsible for remitting the levy directly to the Board at its office in **Winnipeg, Manitoba**, within **seven days after the last day of the week** in which the turkeys were sold.
- This mechanism allows for **streamlined collection** and reduces the administrative burden on producers, especially in cases where the buyer is a large processor or exporter.

#### 4. **Exemption Clause**
- This Order **does not apply** to the sale of turkeys that are **less than 10 days old**.
- This exclusion likely applies to young, newly hatched turkeys that are not yet ready for market or are sold for direct farm-to-consumer or local consumption purposes, which are outside the scope of the marketing levy system.

### **Legal Authority and Citation**
- The Order is issued under the authority granted by **Section 4 of the Manitoba Turkey Order, C.R.C., c. 160**.
- It may be cited as the **Manitoba Turkey Marketing Levies Order, 1984**.

### **Purpose and Implications**

1. **Revenue Generation**:
   - The levy generates revenue for the Board to fund marketing initiatives such as **branding, advertising, research, and promotion** of Manitoba turkey in national and international markets.

2. **Market Support**:
   - By ensuring a consistent funding stream, the levy helps maintain the competitiveness and visibility of Manitoba’s turkey industry in the broader Canadian and global market.

3. **Fair Distribution**:
   - The levy is based on live weight, which ensures that producers with larger flocks or heavier turkeys contribute proportionally more—aligning the cost with production volume.

4. **Administrative Flexibility**:
   - The option for purchasers to pay the levy directly improves efficiency, especially in commercial transactions where buyers may be large-scale processors or exporters.

5. **Exclusion of Young Turkeys**:
   - The 10-day age restriction ensures that the levy does not apply to turkeys in the early stages of growth, which are not yet part of the commercial marketing chain.
