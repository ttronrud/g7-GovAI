Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **Regulation Title and Legal Basis**
- **Title**: *List of Pest Control Product Formulants and Contaminants of Health or Environmental Concern*
- **Legal Authority**: Established under **paragraph 43(5)(b)** of the *Pest Control Products Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 28).
- **Issuing Authority**: The **Minister of Health** of Canada.

This regulation serves to formally identify specific chemical substances—known as **formulants** and **contaminants**—that are used in pest control products and which may pose **health or environmental concerns**.

---

#### **Effective Date**
- The List comes into force on the day that **Section 43 of the Pest Control Products Act** comes into force.
- **Note**: Section 43 was originally enacted in 2002, and the regulation is aligned with its implementation timeline. 
- A reference to **SI/2006-93** (Statutory Instrument 2006-93) indicates that as of **June 28, 2006**, this regulation was in force and updated or confirmed in that version.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This regulation was **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument 2020-44, Section 2**, meaning it is **no longer in effect** as of the date of that repeal.  
> Therefore, while this summary describes the original content and intent, the regulation is **currently invalid and superseded**.

---

#### **Scope of Application**
- Applies **only to pest control products that are registered under the Pest Control Products Act**.
- It does **not** apply to unregistered or non-pest control products.
- The List specifically identifies substances used in formulations (formulants) or present as contaminants (e.g., due to manufacturing processes) that may present **health or environmental risks**.

---

#### **Definition of Key Term**
- **CAS Registry Number**:  
  This is the unique identification number assigned to a chemical substance by the **Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS)**, a division of the **American Chemical Society (ACS)**.  
  - The use of CAS numbers ensures precise identification and traceability of chemicals across scientific, regulatory, and industrial databases.

---

#### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**
1. **Application to Allergens**:
   - The regulation includes a specific provision stating that **Part 2** (which contains allergen-related content) applies not only to listed allergens but also to:
     - Any **protein-containing derivative** of the allergen,
     - **Hydrolyzed plant proteins**,
     - **Starch**, or
     - **Lecithin** derived from the allergen.
   - This broadens the scope to cover related compounds that may still trigger allergic reactions, even if not the original allergen itself.

2. **Purpose of the List**:
   - To inform stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, distributors, users) about potentially harmful substances in pest control products.
   - To support regulatory oversight and risk management by identifying substances that may pose:
     - Health risks (e.g., allergies, toxicity),
     - Environmental risks (e.g., bioaccumulation, harm to non-target species).

---

#### **Status and Current Relevance**
- **Repealed**: The regulation was formally **repealed by SI/2020-44, Section 2**, effective as of the date of that instrument.
- This means:
  - The List is **no longer legally enforceable**.
  - It has been replaced by more up-to-date, comprehensive, or scientifically revised regulatory frameworks.
- The repeal likely reflects advances in scientific understanding, changes in risk assessment methodologies, or the adoption of more modern allergen or contaminant monitoring systems.

---

#### **Regulatory Context**
- The *Pest Control Products Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 28) is the primary Canadian legislation governing the registration, labeling, safety, and environmental impact of pest control products.
- Section 43 empowers the Minister to establish lists of substances of concern to ensure that products are safe for human health and the environment.
- This regulation was part of a broader effort to enhance public health protection and environmental sustainability in the use of pesticides and related chemicals.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation was a **temporary, targeted measure** to identify and regulate specific formulants and contaminants in pest control products that could pose health or environmental risks. While it provided clarity on allergens and related derivatives, it is now **obsolete** due to its repeal in 2020.

> ✅ **Key Takeaway**:  
> The regulation is **historically significant** for understanding Canada’s approach to allergen management in pest control products, but it is **no longer in force**. Current regulations on such matters are governed by updated provisions under the *Pest Control Products Act* and related scientific assessments.

---

### **Recommendation for Stakeholders**
- Review **current versions** of the *Pest Control Products Act* and its amendments, particularly those related to allergens, safety assessments, and environmental impact.
- Consult **Health Canada’s official databases** (e.g., Pest Management Regulatory Agency – PMRA) for up-to-date information on pest control product safety and ingredient restrictions.
