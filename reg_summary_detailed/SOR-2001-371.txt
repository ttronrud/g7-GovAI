The provided text consists of repeated references to the repeal of specific sections of a regulatory instrument, specifically:

- **SOR/2013-48, s. 13** (Statutory Instrument 2013-48, Section 13)  
- **SOR/2009-60, s. 1** (Statutory Instrument 2009-60, Section 1)

However, **no actual regulation or text is included** in the query—only references to repealed sections. Therefore, there is **no detailed summary of a regulation** to provide, as the regulation itself has been officially repealed.

### Summary of the Information:

- The cited sections (SOR/2013-48, s. 13 and SOR/2009-60, s. 1) have been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from legal effect).
- The repeal was enacted through:
  - **SOR/2013-48, s. 13**: This statutory instrument, issued in 2013, formally repealed certain provisions, likely related to environmental, occupational health, or workplace safety regulations, depending on the context of the original regulation.
  - **SOR/2009-60, s. 1**: This earlier instrument, issued in 2009, also repealed a provision, possibly a minor or outdated rule in a regulatory framework (e.g., in the area of occupational safety, hazardous materials, or public health).

### Important Notes:
- Since the sections have been **repealed**, they are **no longer in force** and **do not apply** under current law.
- The repeal means that any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously contained in those sections are **no longer valid**.
- To understand the **original content** of these repealed sections, one would need to consult the **original regulation** (e.g., the predecessor legislation or the full text of SOR/2009-60 or SOR/2013-48 before repeal).
- The repeated citation (three times) suggests that the repeal of these sections was a significant or notable event, possibly due to the importance of the provisions or the scope of the repeal.

### Conclusion:
There is **no detailed summary of a current regulation** to provide, because the referenced sections have been **repealed** and are no longer part of the legal framework. The information provided only indicates that certain regulatory provisions were officially removed from law in 2009 and 2013. To obtain the original content or context of the repealed sections, a search of the official government publications (e.g., Canada Gazette or legislation databases like CanLII or the Canadian government’s legislation website) would be required.

👉 **Recommendation**: For further details on the original provisions, consult the full text of SOR/2009-60 and SOR/2013-48 prior to repeal, or refer to the legislative history or explanatory documents associated with those instruments.
