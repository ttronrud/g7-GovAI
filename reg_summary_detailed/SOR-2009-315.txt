Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation — the *Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations* (as made under the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*) — structured to clearly convey its purpose, key provisions, definitions, requirements, and regulatory framework.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations**

### 🔍 **Overview**

The *Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations* (the "Regulations") were enacted on **April 18, 2009**, following a public consultation period under the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act* (the "Act"). These regulations establish detailed operational, safety, environmental, and administrative standards for oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities in Canada. They are administered by the **National Energy Board (NEB)** — now known as the **Canadian Energy Regulator (CER)** — and apply to both onshore and offshore operations.

These Regulations provide a comprehensive regulatory framework governing:
- Well operations
- Safety and environmental protection
- Management systems
- Reporting and compliance
- Authorization and approval processes
- Emergency preparedness
- Decommissioning and site restoration

They are designed to ensure **safety**, **environmental protection**, **economic efficiency**, and **public accountability** in the oil and gas sector.

| **Seafloor** | Surface of land under the sea. |
| **Slick Line** | Single steel cable used to run tools in a well. |
| **Support Craft** | Vessels, aircraft, or vehicles used for transportation or assistance on-site. |

| **Suspended** | A well in which operations have temporarily ceased. |
| **Termination** | Abandonment, completion, or suspension of well operations. |
| **Waste Material** | Garbage, refuse, sewage, used drilling fluid, cuttings, produced water. |
| **Well Approval** | Approval granted by the Board under section 13. |
| **Well-Bore** | Hole drilled by a bit to make a well. |
| **Well Control** | Control of fluid movement into or out of a well. |
| **Well Operation** | Includes drilling, completion, workover, re-entry, suspension, abandonment. |

| **Workover** | Operation requiring removal of Christmas tree or tubing from a completed well. |
| **Zone** | A stratum or sequence of strata; may be designated by the Board. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Terms like *delineation well*, *development well*, *exploratory well*, *drilling installation*, *production installation*, etc., are defined consistently with existing regulations (e.g., *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* and *Canada Oil and Gas Installations Regulations*).

> 🔍 **Special Definitions for Section 5(4)(c)**:
> - **Production Facility**: Equipment at a site for production (separation, processing, storage), **excluding** platforms, artificial islands, or subsea systems.
> - **Production Platform**: Includes the facility and all associated platforms, artificial islands, subsea systems, drilling equipment, and diving systems.
