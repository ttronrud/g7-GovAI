**Detailed Summary of the National Parks Land Rents Remission Order, No. 2**

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to make orders remitting land rents when it is in the public interest. The decision is based on the recommendation of two key federal departments:
- The **Minister of Canadian Heritage**
- The **Treasury Board**

This demonstrates a collaborative approach between heritage policy and financial administration to address land rent issues in national parks.

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of the **National Parks Land Rents Remission Order, No. 2** is to **provide financial relief to leaseholders** of public lands located within designated national parks. Specifically, it offers **partial remission (reduction or cancellation)** of rent obligations that would otherwise be due in the year 2000 and for subsequent years, under specific lease conditions.

The remission is designed to:
- Alleviate financial hardship for leaseholders during a period of significant rent adjustments.
- Promote public interest by ensuring sustainable land use in national parks without placing undue burden on private operators or leaseholders.
- Reflect the economic realities of changing rental rates over time, particularly in a transition from higher to lower rates.

---

### **Scope of Application**
The order applies to:
- **Leaseholders** who hold leasehold interests in **public lands situated within national parks** listed in **Schedule I to the Canada National Parks Act**.
- Leases that are governed by:
  - The **terms of the applicable lease agreement**
  - The **National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations (1991)**

Thus, only those lease arrangements that are formally recognized and regulated under the current national parks framework are eligible.

### **Two Types of Rent Remission (Based on Lease Duration)**

#### **1. Ten-Year Lease Period (Beginning in 2000)**
- **Eligibility**: Leaseholders whose rent is due to be fixed in **2000** for a **ten-year period beginning in 2000** (i.e., 2000–2009).
- **Remission Amount**:
  - Equal to the **difference between**:
    - The **rental rate for the second year** of the ten-year period (i.e., 2001)
    - The **rental rate for the last year** of the period (i.e., 2009)
  - In formula form:
    > Remission = Rental Rate (2001) – Rental Rate (2009)

> ✅ This means that if the rent in 2001 was higher than in 2009, the leaseholder receives a remission equal to that difference.  
> ❌ If the rent in 2001 was lower than in 2009, no remission is granted.

👉 This provision is designed to **offset a declining rental rate** over time, rewarding leaseholders who faced a drop in income due to rent reductions.

#### **2. Two-Year Lease Period (Beginning in 2000)**
- **Eligibility**: Leaseholders whose rent is due to be fixed in **2000** for a **two-year period beginning in 2000** (i.e., 2000–2001).
- **Remission Amount**:
  - Equal to the **sum of two differences**:
    1. The amount by which the rental rate for the **first year (2000)** exceeds the rental rate for the **second year (2001)**  
       → (2000 Rate – 2001 Rate)
    2. The amount by which the rental rate for the **second year (2000–2001)** exceeds the rental rate for the **second year of the ending period (2001–2002)**  
       → (2001 Rate – 2002 Rate)

> In formula form:
> > Remission = (Rate 2000 – Rate 2001) + (Rate 2001 – Rate 2002)

> ✅ This results in a **total remission** that captures the **entire decline in rent over the two-year span**, even if the drop is gradual.

👉 This provision is especially beneficial for short-term leaseholders who experience a **significant drop in rent from year one to year two**, and again from year two to the end of the term.

### **Key Observations and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Public Interest Justification** | The remission is not automatic—it is justified as being in the public interest, suggesting a balance between conservation goals and economic fairness for land users. |
| **Rent Decline as a Trigger** | The remission only applies when rent decreases over time. No benefit is given if rents increase or remain stable. |
| **Time-Based Structure** | The order targets a specific year (2000) and a specific time horizon (ten or two years), making it a **historical policy measure** tied to the early 2000s. |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | The order strictly follows the **National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations (1991)**, ensuring legal consistency and transparency. |
| **No Retroactive Benefit** | The remission applies only to rent that is **due or fixed in 2000**—it does not cover prior or future years. |

### **Conclusion**

The **National Parks Land Rents Remission Order, No. 2** is a targeted, time-limited financial relief measure enacted in **1991** to assist leaseholders in national parks facing declining rental rates during the early 2000s. It operates under a clear, transparent formula based on the difference between initial and final rental rates, with two distinct provisions for **longer-term (10-year)** and **shorter-term (2-year)** leases.

This regulation reflects a pragmatic approach to balancing:
- **Environmental conservation** (by maintaining land access within national parks)
- **Economic fairness** (by mitigating rent reductions for leaseholders)

While it is a historical policy from 1991, it remains a notable example of how federal government can intervene in land lease arrangements to support both public interest and private stakeholders.

**Note**: This order is now largely historical, as it pertains to rent adjustments in the year 2000. Modern rent adjustments in national parks are likely governed by updated regulations and may not follow the same structure. However, it serves as a valuable reference for understanding past government interventions in park land use and rental policy.
