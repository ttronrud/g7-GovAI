The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2017-6" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 6 of 2017 has been formally repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter — e.g., environmental, transport, health, or employment regulation), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content of the original regulation that was repealed.

In general, a statutory instrument (SI) such as SI/2017-6 would typically be a secondary piece of legislation introduced under the authority of an Act of Parliament. It may have covered a specific area such as:

- Licensing or compliance requirements
- Administrative procedures
- Safety standards
- Environmental controls
- Employment practices
- Tax or financial regulations

Once an SI is marked as "repealed," it means:

1. The regulation is no longer in force.
2. It has been formally removed from the legal framework by a subsequent legislative or administrative action.
3. The repeal may be due to:
   - The enactment of a new, more comprehensive or updated law
   - Obsolescence or redundancy
   - Inconsistency with current legislation
   - A decision to streamline or simplify regulatory frameworks

For example, if SI/2017-6 had been a regulation on workplace safety, its repeal might have been due to the implementation of a broader safety framework under a new Act.

To provide a detailed summary, the full title and content of the original SI/2017-6 would be required. As of now, based on the information provided, the only factual detail is that **SI/2017-6 has been repealed**.

Therefore, the detailed summary is:

> The Statutory Instrument SI/2017-6 has been formally repealed. This means the regulation was no longer in force and is legally invalid. The exact subject matter, scope, and provisions of the original regulation are not available in the provided information. To offer a detailed summary of its content, the full title and text of SI/2017-6 would be required. The repeal likely occurred due to legislative update, redundancy, or replacement by a more comprehensive or current legal instrument. Without further details, a specific summary of its provisions cannot be provided.

If you can provide the full title or subject area of SI/2017-6 (e.g., "The Employment Rights (Amendment) Regulations 2017"), I can offer a more detailed and accurate summary.
