The provided regulation text has been **repealed** and is no longer in force. Here is a detailed summary of what the regulation *originally* stated—prior to its repeal—along with context on its legal significance and current status:

---

### **Summary of the Repealed Regulation (SOR/2003-116, s. 23, 25, 26)**

#### **1. Oath of Allegiance**
- **Provision (SOR/2003-116, s. 23):**  
  The *Oaths of Allegiance Act* establishes the formal oath of allegiance that must be taken and subscribed by the Commissioner of Yukon.  
  This oath is a legal requirement affirming the Commissioner’s loyalty to the Canadian Crown and the principles of Canadian governance.

- **Purpose:**  
  The oath of allegiance ensures that the Commissioner of Yukon is a loyal servant of the Crown, upholding the constitutional and legal framework of Canada, particularly in a territorial jurisdiction.

#### **2. Oath of Office**
- **Provision (Schedule I):**  
  The specific text of the *oath of office* for the Commissioner of Yukon is set out in **Schedule I** of the regulation.  
  This oath outlines the duties, responsibilities, and commitments of the Commissioner, including the duty to serve the people of the Yukon Territory impartially, faithfully, and in accordance with the law.

- **Key Elements (Implied from typical oaths of office):**  
  While the full text of Schedule I is not included in the excerpt, such oaths typically include:
  - A commitment to uphold the Constitution of Canada.
  - A pledge to serve the public interest.
  - A declaration of loyalty to the Crown.
  - A commitment to act with integrity, independence, and accountability.

#### **3. Venue for Swearing In**
- **Provision (SOR/2003-116, s. 25):**  
  The Commissioner of Yukon must take and subscribe both the oath of allegiance and the oath of office before:
  - A **judge of the Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory**, or
  - In the judge’s absence, a **police magistrate**.

- **Legal Authority:**  
  This provision establishes the proper judicial authority for the swearing-in ceremony. The requirement ensures that the swearing-in is conducted in a legally valid and formal manner, with the appropriate level of judicial oversight.

#### **4. Repeal Status**
- **Repealed by SOR/2003-116, s. 23, 25, 26:**  
  These provisions were officially **repealed** (cancelled or replaced) by **Regulation 2003-116, Section 23, 25, and 26**.  
  This means that the requirement for the Commissioner of Yukon to take the oath of allegiance and oath of office under these specific provisions is **no longer applicable**.

- **Reason for Repeal:**  
  The repeal likely reflects a change in the administrative or constitutional framework governing the appointment and swearing-in of territorial commissioners. It may have been replaced by a new regulation, a different statutory framework, or a decision to streamline or modernize the process.

### **Current Legal Status**
- **Out of Force:**  
  As of the date of repeal (2003), the provisions described are **no longer valid or enforceable** in the legal system of the Yukon Territory.  
  Any current swearing-in of the Commissioner of Yukon must follow a different legal or procedural framework, which may be found in updated legislation, administrative regulations, or bylaws.

- **Possible Replacement:**  
  The current process for swearing in the Commissioner of Yukon may now be governed by:
  - The *Commissioners of Yukon Act* (or a similar statute),
  - A more recent regulation (e.g., under the *Yukon Territorial Government Act*),
  - Or administrative guidelines issued by the Yukon government.

### **Conclusion**
The regulation in question, while historically significant, is **repealed** and **no longer in effect**. It originally mandated that the Commissioner of Yukon take the oath of allegiance (as defined in the Oaths of Allegiance Act) and the oath of office (as set out in Schedule I), and that these oaths be administered before a judge of the Supreme Court of the Yukon or a police magistrate. However, due to the repeal in 2003, these requirements are no longer legally binding. For current procedures, one must consult the most recent legislation or administrative rules governing the appointment and swearing-in of the Commissioner of Yukon.
