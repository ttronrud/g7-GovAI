### **Detailed Summary of the Quebec Family Allowances (1989) Remission Order**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**.
- It is authorized under **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the federal government to make orders related to the remission (i.e., forgiveness or cancellation) of income taxes in specific circumstances deemed to be in the **public interest**.
- The **purpose** of this Order is to provide a tax relief measure for individuals who received **Quebec Family Allowances in 1989**.

#### **2. Title of the Order**
- The Order is officially titled:  
  **"Quebec Family Allowances (1989) Remission Order"**  
  and may be cited as such.

#### **3. Key Definitions**
- **"Act"** refers to the **Income Tax Act** (specifically, the federal legislation governing income taxation in Canada).
- **"Remission"** means the **cancellation or forgiveness** of certain income taxes, interest, and penalties that would otherwise have been due.

#### **4. Who Is Eligible?**
- The remission applies to **every individual** who:
  - Received **family allowances** in **1989** under the **Family Allowances Act of the Province of Quebec**.
  - These allowances were provided by the provincial government as financial support to families with children.

#### **5. What Is Being Remitted?**
- The Order grants a **remission of income taxes, interest, and penalties** for the **1989 taxation year**.
- The amount of remission is calculated as follows:

> **Remission Amount =**  
> *(Taxes, interest, and penalties payable under Parts I and I.1 of the Income Tax Act for 1989)*  
> **minus**  
> *(Taxes, interest, and penalties that would have been payable if the family allowance amounts had NOT been included in the individual’s income for 1989)*

#### **6. Key Principle of the Remission**
- The remission is **not a blanket refund** or a general tax reduction.
- It is **proportional** to the tax burden that would have been imposed **if the family allowance had been counted as income**.
- In other words:
  - The individual was **required to pay taxes** on the family allowance because it was treated as income under the Income Tax Act.
  - However, the **family allowance is not taxable income** under the Income Tax Act (as it is a non-taxable benefit provided by the province).
  - Therefore, the remission compensates for the **overpayment of taxes** that occurred due to the **incorrect inclusion** of the allowance in taxable income.

#### **7. Public Interest Justification**
- The Governor General in Council has determined that it is in the **public interest** to provide this remission.
- This likely reflects a recognition that:
  - Family allowances are **social welfare benefits** intended to support low- and middle-income families.
  - Including such benefits in taxable income leads to **unfair tax burdens** on families who are not earning income from employment or investment.
  - Correcting this error ensures **fairness and equity** in the tax system.

#### **8. Scope and Limitations**
- The Order applies **only to the 1989 taxation year**.
- It applies **only to individuals** who received family allowances under the **Quebec Family Allowances Act**.
- The remission applies **only to taxes, interest, and penalties** under **Parts I and I.1** of the Income Tax Act (which generally cover personal income tax and related charges).
- It does **not** extend to:
  - Other years.
  - Other types of benefits or allowances.
  - Taxes on other income sources.

#### **9. Practical Effect**
- For an individual who received family allowances in 1989:
  - The government will **cancel or reduce** the taxes, interest, and penalties they were required to pay on that year.
  - The amount canceled will be equal to the **difference** between:
    - What they actually paid (because the allowance was treated as income), and
    - What they would have paid if the allowance had been excluded from taxable income.

#### **10. Significance**
- This Order is a **corrective measure** that aligns federal tax treatment with the **intended purpose** of family allowances—providing financial support without increasing the tax burden on families.
- It reflects a **policy of tax equity and fairness**, recognizing that certain government benefits should not be subject to taxation.

### **In Simple Terms:**
This regulation says:  
> "If you received family allowances from the Province of Quebec in 1989, and those allowances were incorrectly counted as income for your federal tax return, then the federal government will cancel the extra taxes, interest, and penalties you were charged because of that mistake. The amount canceled will be exactly the difference between what you paid and what you would have paid if the allowance had not been included in your income."

### **Conclusion**
The **Quebec Family Allowances (1989) Remission Order** is a targeted, equitable correction to a tax error. It ensures that families receiving provincial family allowances are not unfairly taxed under federal rules. By remitting the overpaid taxes, the government promotes fairness, supports family well-being, and upholds the principle that certain government benefits should remain non-taxable.
