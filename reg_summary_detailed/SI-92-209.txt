Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Foreign Aircraft Servicing Equipment Remission Order, 1992**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- **Issuing Body**: His Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation**: Made by the Minister of National Revenue.
- **Legal Basis**: Pursuant to **subsection 23(2)** of the *Financial Administration Act*.
- **Purpose**: To revoke a previous order (the *Foreign Aircraft Servicing Equipment Remission Order, 1991*) and establish a new, updated version for 1992, based on public interest considerations.

> This means the government has formally removed an earlier policy and introduced a new one under the authority of federal financial administration laws, specifically allowing for duty remission under certain conditions.

---

#### **2. Official Title and Citation**
- **Title**: *Foreign Aircraft Servicing Equipment Remission Order, 1992*  
- **Citation**: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2) — indicating it is a statutory instrument originating from the *Customs Tariff Act* (or related legislation), and the specific section referenced is from a prior enactment.

> Note: The citation suggests that the original order was issued in 1991 under section 7(2) of a statute (likely the *Customs Tariff*), and this 1992 version revokes and replaces it.

---

#### **3. Scope of the Remission**
The regulation grants **remission (exemption or reduction)** of two types of taxes on imported equipment used exclusively for servicing foreign-registered aircraft:

##### **(a) Customs Duties**
- **What is remitted**: Customs duties paid or payable under the *Customs Tariff*.
- **Eligible Goods**: Machinery and equipment imported into Canada **on or after September 17, 1969**.
- **Purpose of Import**: The equipment must be used **exclusively** to service aircraft that are:
  - Registered in a **foreign country or territory**.
  - Operating at **international airports in Canada**.
- **Key Condition**: At the time of importation, the **foreign country or territory must grant a similar privilege** to Canadian-registered aircraft.

> This reciprocal condition ensures that the Canadian policy is aligned with international practices. For example, if a foreign country allows its own aircraft to be serviced in Canada without paying duties, Canada may similarly allow foreign aircraft to be serviced in Canada without duty payments — creating a balanced, reciprocal arrangement.

> **Example**: If the United States allows U.S.-registered aircraft to be serviced in Canada without duty, Canada may allow foreign aircraft to be serviced in Canada without customs duties — provided the foreign country grants similar treatment to Canadian aircraft.

##### **(b) Sales Tax (Excise Tax)**
- **What is remitted**: Sales tax paid or payable under the *Excise Tax Act*.
- **Amount of Remission**: Equal to the **difference** between:
  1. The **actual sales tax** paid or payable on the goods, and  
  2. The sales tax that **would have been payable** if the **duty-paid value** used to calculate the sales tax had been **reduced by the amount of the customs duty remission**.

> In simpler terms:
> - Sales tax in Canada is typically calculated based on the **duty-paid value** (i.e., the cost of the goods plus any duties).
> - If customs duties are remitted (i.e., not paid), the duty-paid value is reduced.
> - Therefore, the **sales tax is reduced proportionally** — the difference between the original tax and the tax based on the lower duty-paid value is refunded or remitted.

> This ensures that the **overall tax burden** on the equipment is not increased due to the remission of customs duties — maintaining tax fairness and consistency.

#### **4. Key Principles and Rationale**
- **Public Interest**: The Governor General in Council acted based on the public interest, indicating that the policy supports international aviation cooperation, promotes economic efficiency, and maintains fairness in cross-border trade.
- **Reciprocity**: The policy is not unilaterally applied. It requires that the **foreign country or territory provides equivalent treatment** to Canadian aircraft. This prevents unilateral advantage and ensures fairness.
- **Time Limit**: The eligibility starts from **September 17, 1969**, meaning older equipment or imports before this date are not covered.
- **Exclusivity Requirement**: Equipment must be used **exclusively** for servicing foreign-registered aircraft — preventing misuse or broader commercial applications.

---

#### **5. Practical Implications**
- **For Importers**: 
  - Can import aircraft servicing equipment into Canada without paying customs duties, provided the foreign country offers similar treatment.
  - Must prove both the foreign country’s reciprocal privilege and the exclusive use of the equipment for foreign aircraft servicing.
- **For Tax Authorities**:
  - Sales tax on such equipment will be adjusted downward by the amount of customs duty remission.
  - The adjustment ensures compliance with the principle of "tax neutrality" — the total tax liability is not increased by the remission of duties.
- **For International Aviation Industry**:
  - Encourages smoother operations at international airports by reducing costs for foreign airlines.
  - Promotes Canada as a cooperative and open aviation hub.

---

#### **6. Duration and Effectiveness**
- The Order is **in force from its date of publication** and remains valid until revoked or amended by future legislation.
- It applies to all imports of qualifying equipment **on or after September 17, 1969**.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a **reciprocal, condition-based remission** of both **customs duties and sales tax** for machinery and equipment used to service foreign-registered aircraft at Canadian international airports. It is grounded in fairness, reciprocity, and public interest, ensuring that Canadian aviation infrastructure supports international operations without imposing undue financial burdens — provided that the foreign country offers equivalent treatment to Canadian aircraft.

It reflects Canada’s commitment to international cooperation in aviation and maintains alignment with global trade practices through a balanced, rules-based approach.

> **Note**: This is a **revocation and replacement** of a prior order (1991), suggesting that the 1992 version may have been introduced to clarify, refine, or expand the original policy based on evolving international conditions or administrative needs.
