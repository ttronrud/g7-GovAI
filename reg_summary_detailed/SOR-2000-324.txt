**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: *Regulations Respecting Anti-Competitive Acts of Persons Operating a Domestic Service***  
*(S.C. 2000, c. 15, s. 13(3); R.S., c. 19 (2nd Supp.), s. 19)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
This regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendations of the **Minister of Industry** and the **Minister of Transport**, under **subsection 78(2)a of the Competition Act**.  

The primary objective is to **prohibit anti-competitive conduct** by **persons operating a domestic service**—specifically, air carriers—within the context of Canada’s air transportation market. These rules are designed to ensure fair competition, prevent market manipulation, and protect consumers by preventing practices that restrict or distort competition.

---

### **2. Scope of Application**
The regulation applies to **persons operating a domestic air service**, as defined in **subsection 55(1) of the Canada Transportation Act**. This includes airlines that provide scheduled passenger or cargo services within Canada.

---

### **3. Anti-Competitive Acts Under Paragraph 78(1)(j) of the Competition Act**

The following acts or conduct are deemed **anti-competitive** and are prohibited under the Competition Act:

#### **(a) Operating Capacity at Uncoverable Fares**
- A carrier may **not operate capacity (i.e., flights or routes)** at fares that **do not cover the avoidable cost** of providing the service.
- *Avoidable cost* refers to the cost that could be avoided if the service were not provided (e.g., variable operating expenses, not fixed infrastructure).
- This prevents airlines from offering services at prices that are below cost, which could be used to drive competitors out of the market.

#### **(b) Increasing Capacity at Uncoverable Fares**
- Similarly, **increasing capacity** (such as adding more flights or routes) at fares that fail to cover avoidable costs is prohibited.
- This prevents price-based predatory behavior where a dominant carrier expands its operations at a loss to eliminate rivals.

#### **(c) Use of a Low-Cost Second-Brand Carrier**
- A carrier may not use a **low-cost second-brand carrier** (e.g., a subsidiary or affiliated brand operating at lower prices) in a way that:
  - Is intended to **undermine or eliminate a competitor**, or
  - **Impede or prevent a competitor from entering or expanding** in the market.
- This provision targets practices where a parent airline uses a low-cost brand to engage in predatory pricing or market exclusion.

#### **(d) Pre-empting Airport Facilities or Services**
- A carrier may not **pre-empt (reserve or block access to)** airport facilities or services (e.g., gates, counters, check-in areas) that are **required by another air carrier** to operate its business.
- The purpose must be to **withhold these facilities or services from the market**.
- This prevents dominant carriers from using their access to airport infrastructure to exclude competitors.

#### **(e) Pre-empting Take-Off or Landing Slots**
- Where not governed by other legislation (e.g., slot allocation rules under different Acts), a carrier may not **pre-empt take-off or landing slots** required by another carrier for its operations.
- The intent must be to **withhold these slots from the market**.
- This protects smaller or independent carriers from being blocked from operating due to lack of access to essential airport slots.

#### **(f) Using Commissions, Incentives, or Inducements to Discipline or Eliminate Competitors**
- A carrier may not offer **commissions, incentives, or other inducements** (e.g., rebates, bonuses, preferential terms) to:
  - Sell or purchase flights with the **purpose of disciplining or eliminating a competitor**.
  - Impede or prevent a competitor from entering or expanding in the market.
- This targets collusion or predatory behavior involving financial incentives to influence market dynamics.

#### **(g) Using Loyalty Marketing Programs to Discourage Competition**
- A carrier may not use **loyalty marketing programs** (e.g., frequent flyer programs) with the intent to:
  - Discourage or eliminate a competitor.
  - Impede or prevent a competitor from entering or expanding in the market.
- This prevents the use of customer retention tools to create barriers to entry.

#### **(h) Altering Schedules, Networks, or Infrastructure to Impede Competition**
- A carrier may not **alter its flight schedules, network structure, or infrastructure** (e.g., route changes, hub closures) with the purpose of:
  - Disciplining or eliminating a competitor.
  - Preventing a competitor from entering or expanding in the market.
- This includes strategic changes that reduce market access or create unfair advantages.

> ⚠️ **Note**: These acts are considered anti-competitive under **paragraph 78(1)(j)** of the Competition Act, which prohibits acts that have the effect of substantially lessening competition.

### **4. Definition of "Essential Facilities and Services" Under Paragraph 78(1)(k)**

This section defines what constitutes **essential facilities and services** necessary for an air carrier to operate in a competitive market.

A facility or service is considered **essential** if it meets **all of the following criteria**:

1. **Required for Competitive Air Service**  
   - The facility or service is **necessary** to provide a competitive air service (e.g., a gate, slot, or maintenance service).

2. **Cannot Be Reasonably Purchased or Acquired**  
   - It is **not feasible or practical** for another carrier to independently purchase, acquire, provide, or replicate the service on its own.

3. **Effectively Controlled by the Carrier Refusing Access**  
   - The carrier that denies access **effectively controls** the facility or service (e.g., holds exclusive rights or operational authority).

4. **Can Be Feasibly Provided to Another Carrier**  
   - Despite the above, the facility or service **can be feasibly provided** to another carrier, **taking into account**:
     - Operational constraints
     - Safety requirements
     - Legitimate business justifications of the carrier

> ✅ This definition ensures that access to essential services is not unreasonably withheld, even if the carrier claims operational or safety reasons.

---

### **5. Examples of Facilities and Services Covered**
The regulation explicitly lists several types of airport infrastructure and services that may qualify as essential:

- **Take-off and landing slots**  
- **Interline arrangements** (e.g., code-sharing agreements)  
- **Airport gates**  
- **Loading bridges**  
- **Check-in counters**  
- **Baggage handling infrastructure, equipment, and services**  
- **Maintenance services**

> These are all critical components that enable airlines to operate efficiently and safely.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Effectiveness**
- The regulation comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- It is enforceable under the **Competition Act**, meaning that the **Competition Bureau** or the **Canadian Competition Tribunal** may investigate and take action against violations.
- Violations may result in **fines, injunctions, or other remedies** to restore competitive conditions.

---

### **7. Key Principles Underlying the Regulation**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prevention of Predatory Pricing** | Prohibits operating or expanding at losses to eliminate competitors. |
| **Market Access and Fairness** | Ensures all carriers have equitable access to essential airport infrastructure. |
| **Anti-Abuse of Market Power** | Prevents dominant carriers from using their position to stifle competition. |
| **Consumer Protection** | Supports lower prices, better service, and innovation through fair competition. |

---

### **8. Limitations and Exclusions**
- The regulation **does not apply** to take-off or landing slot allocations governed by other Acts (e.g., the *Airports Act* or other sector-specific legislation).
- The prohibition on pre-empting slots or facilities **only applies when the intent is to withhold them from the market**—not in cases of legitimate operational needs.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation strengthens Canada’s competition regime in the domestic air transport sector by clearly defining and prohibiting anti-competitive behaviors. It protects smaller and emerging airlines from being unfairly excluded from the market through predatory pricing, access denial, or strategic manipulation of infrastructure and customer loyalty programs.

By establishing clear standards for what constitutes an anti-competitive act and defining essential facilities, the regulation promotes a **fair, transparent, and competitive environment** in Canada’s domestic air services market—ultimately benefiting consumers through better service, lower prices, and greater innovation.

---

**Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**:
- Airlines must ensure that all pricing covers avoidable costs.
- They must not use low-cost brands or loyalty programs to eliminate rivals.
- Access to airport facilities and slots must be granted fairly and not withheld with discriminatory intent.
- Any changes to schedules or networks must not be used to block competition.

This regulation remains a cornerstone of Canada’s efforts to maintain a competitive and equitable domestic air transport market.
