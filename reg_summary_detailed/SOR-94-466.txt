**Detailed Summary of the Dairy Products Marketing Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Dairy Products Marketing Regulations* are a set of rules established under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act* (Act) by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture. These regulations govern the **marketing of dairy products** in **interprovincial and export trade**, with specific provisions related to quotas, licensing, production controls, record-keeping, and enforcement.

Importantly, these regulations **do not apply** to the marketing of **liquid milk or cream for consumer use** in intraprovincial trade — a key distinction that ensures the system remains focused on commercial, processed dairy products intended for broader markets.

### **Key Definitions and Terminology**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act*, the enabling legislation under which these regulations operate. |
| **Board** | A provincial body established under provincial law to regulate the production or marketing of dairy products within its province. Must be a signatory to the *National Milk Marketing Plan* (NMMP), as amended. Boards manage **provincial quotas**. |
| **Committee** | The *Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee*, established under the NMMP, responsible for setting and adjusting **federal quotas** based on national demand and supply. |
| **Dairy Year** | A 12-month period beginning on **August 1** after the regulations come into force. This is the key timeframe for quota allocation and planning. |
| **Federal Quota** | The total quantity of milk or cream (including components) authorized by the federal government for **interprovincial or export trade**. Allocated by the Committee. |
| **Provincial Quota** | The total quantity of milk or cream authorized by a provincial Board for **intraprovincial trade**. |
| **Marketing** | Broadly defined to include all activities such as selling, buying, pricing, assembling, packing, storing, transporting, and delivering dairy products. |
| **Federal Licence** | A legal authorization issued by the Commission to individuals or entities that are entitled to market dairy products in interprovincial or export trade. |
| **Canadian Requirements** | The estimated total demand for milk and cream in dairy products during a given dairy year, based on: <br> - Previous year’s production (across provinces with Boards), <br> - Imports and exports of dairy products, <br> - Inventory held by the Commission, <br> - Anticipated future demand. |

> **Note:** Several definitions (e.g., "dairy product," "milk," "cream") were **repealed** in 2001 and 2005, reflecting policy changes and the evolution of the regulatory framework.

### **Core Provisions and Regulatory Framework**

#### **1. Scope of Application**
- Applies to:
  - The **production for marketing** or **marketing** of dairy products in **interprovincial or export trade**.
- **Excludes**:
  - Marketing of **liquid milk or cream for direct consumer use** in intraprovincial trade.

> This means the regulations focus on **commercial dairy products** (e.g., cheese, butter, yogurt, whey) rather than raw milk or fresh dairy for home consumption.

---

#### **2. Determination of Canadian Requirements**
- At the start of each dairy year, the **Canadian Dairy Commission (Commission)** calculates the **Canadian requirements** for milk and cream.
- The calculation is based on:
  - Historical production in provinces with Boards,
  - Imports and exports of dairy products,
  - Inventory held by the Commission,
  - Projected demand for the new dairy year.
- The Commission may **adjust** these requirements **during** the dairy year based on actual production, use, and demand data.

> This dynamic approach allows for responsiveness to real-world market conditions.

---

#### **3. Allocation of Federal Quotas**
- The **portion of the federal quota** available to each Board is determined **before the start of each dairy year**.
- This allocation is made by the **unanimous agreement of the Committee**, after considering the Canadian requirements.
- If adjustments to Canadian requirements occur during the year, the Committee must **quickly adjust** the federal quota allocation via unanimous agreement.

> This ensures fairness and transparency in quota distribution among provinces.

---

#### **4. Allotment of Quotas by Boards**
- A Board may:
  - Allot a share of the **federal quota** to any eligible producer,
  - Suspend or cancel any allotted portion.
- **Critical Rule**: When a Board allocates a share of the **federal quota**, it must do so **at the same time** as it allocates a share of the **provincial quota** to the same producer.
- Boards may apply the **same criteria, rules, and powers** used for provincial quota management when allocating federal quota shares.

> This ensures consistency and alignment between provincial and federal allocation systems.

---

#### **5. Federal Licence Requirements**
- A **federal licence** is required to engage in interprovincial or export trade of dairy products.
- A person may be issued a licence only if:
  1. They hold a share of the federal quota,  
  2. They are **registered as a milk producer** with the **Manitoba Milk Producers**, **or**  
  3. They are **licensed as a cream producer** under Ontario’s *Milk Act*.

> This ensures that only legitimate, registered producers can participate in the federal marketing system.

- A federal licence is **valid only as long as**:
  - The holder continues to hold a share of the federal quota, and
  - They maintain their producer status (registration or licensing).

> This creates a direct link between eligibility and ongoing compliance.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on Unlicensed Marketing**
- **No person may market a dairy product in interprovincial or export trade** unless:
  - The product is made from milk or cream produced by someone who holds a **federal licence**.

> This is a central enforcement mechanism to prevent unauthorized or unregulated trade.

> Applies to all dairy products produced **in Canada**.

---

#### **7. Intraprovincial Marketing Restrictions**
- If a dairy product is **required by provincial law** to be marketed **within a province** through a Board or to a designated person, then:
  - That product **cannot be marketed in interprovincial or export trade** except through that same Board or to that designated person.

> This prevents bypassing provincial oversight and maintains regulatory control at the provincial level.

---

#### **8. Levies, Charges, and Financial Oversight**
- The Commission has the authority to:
  - **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from producers and marketers involved in interprovincial or export trade.
  - Classify these entities into different groups and set **group-specific levies**.
  - Use collected funds for the **operation and functions** of the Canadian Dairy Commission under the Act.

> This provides a revenue stream to support the Commission’s regulatory and market management functions.

---

#### **9. Record-Keeping Obligations**
- Every person involved in the **production or processing** of a dairy product for interprovincial or export trade must:
  - Maintain **complete, accurate books and records** of all relevant production and processing activities.
  - Make those records **available upon request** by the Commission.

> This ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability in the supply chain.

---

#### **10. Enforcement and Seizure Powers**
- An inspector appointed under the Act may **seize** a dairy product if there is **reasonable grounds** to believe it was marketed in interprovincial or export trade in **violation** of these regulations.
- If the product is **perishable**, the inspector must:
  - Dispose of it promptly,
  - Any proceeds from disposal are **credited to the Canadian Dairy Commission Account**.
- If the producer is later found **not to have violated** the rule, the Commission must **return** the product or proceeds to the producer.

> This provides a mechanism for enforcement while protecting legitimate producers from unjust penalties.

---

### **Key Repeal Notes**
Several provisions were **repealed** over time:
- **"Cream" and "dairy product"** were repealed in 2001 (SOR/2001-14, s.1) — likely due to outdated definitions.
- **WTO Agreement** references were repealed in 2005 (SOR/2005-290, s.1 & s.2) — indicating alignment with international trade obligations.
- Several sections (e.g., s.5, s.6) were repealed in 2005, suggesting that the regulatory structure was reformed to modernize and simplify the system.

> These repeals reflect a shift from a rigid, centrally controlled system to a more flexible, market-responsive, and internationally aligned framework.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Objectives**

The regulations aim to:
1. **Stabilize the dairy market** by managing supply through quotas.
2. **Ensure fair access** to interprovincial and export markets via transparent allocation processes.
3. **Protect consumers and producers** through traceability, record-keeping, and accountability.
4. **Support national food security** by aligning production with demand.
5. **Promote cooperation** between federal and provincial governments through the National Milk Marketing Plan.

### **Conclusion**

The *Dairy Products Marketing Regulations* form a foundational regulatory framework for managing the interprovincial and export trade of dairy products in Canada. By establishing clear rules around quota allocation, licensing, record-keeping, and enforcement, the regulations ensure market stability, fairness, and compliance.
