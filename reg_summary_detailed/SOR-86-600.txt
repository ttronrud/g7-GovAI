### **Detailed Summary of the Central Registry of Divorce Proceedings Regulations, 1986**

---

#### **Background and Legal Authority**
These regulations were introduced by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice**, under **subsection 26(1) of the Divorce Act, 1985**. The purpose was to **repeal the previous Divorce Regulations (C.R.C., c. 557)** and replace them with a new set of rules establishing a **centralized registry for divorce proceedings in Canada**.

The new regulations came into force on **June 1, 1986** (S.C. 1986, c. 4), and were designed to improve transparency, prevent duplication of proceedings, and ensure that courts are aware of existing or pending divorce cases involving the same spouses.

> **Note:** These regulations were repealed in 2013 under SOR/2013-169, Section 2. However, this summary focuses on their original content and intent.

---

## **Key Components of the Regulations**

---

### **1. Definition of Key Terms**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Divorce Act, 1985*.
- **Application for divorce**: A formal request submitted under subsection 8(1) of the Divorce Act.
- **Central registry**: A centralized database established in **Ottawa, Ontario**, to track all divorce proceedings across Canada.
- **Order**: Refers to the *Central Registry of Divorce Proceedings Fee Order*, which governs fees associated with filing and processing applications.
- **Registrar**: The chief administrative officer of a court (including the registrar, prothonotary, or clerk of the court).

> *Note: The "registration form" was later repealed (SOR/2013-169, s. 3), meaning the system now relies on electronic or standardized forms agreed upon between registrars and the central registry.*

---

### **2. Establishment and Location of the Central Registry**

- A **central registry of divorce proceedings** is established in **Ottawa, Ontario**.
- This registry serves as a **national database** to help courts determine whether a divorce proceeding is already pending or whether a prior divorce has already been granted.

---

### **3. Mandate of the Central Registry**

The primary purpose of the registry is to:
- Assist courts in determining **jurisdiction** over divorce cases.
- Prevent **duplicate filings** by spouses applying for divorce in different courts.
- Maintain a **comprehensive, accurate record** of all divorce proceedings involving a given marriage.

This is achieved by collecting and storing specific personal and procedural information about each application.

---

### **4. Assignment of Divorce Registry Numbers**

When an application for divorce is filed:

#### **(a) Number Assignment**
- The **registrar of the court** must assign a unique **divorce registry number** to the application.
- The number must be the **next sequential number** after the last one assigned by that court’s registrar.

#### **(b) Information to Be Provided to the Central Registry (within 7 days)**
Within seven days of filing, the registrar must submit the following information to the central registry:

| Information Item | Details |
|------------------|--------|
| Court number and divorce registry number | Assigned to the application |
| Province and date of filing | Where and when the application was filed |
| Date of marriage | For the marriage in question |
| For each spouse: | |
| - Role in the proceeding | Applicant, joint applicant, or respondent |
| - Surname and given names on the day before marriage | As they existed at the time of marriage |
| - Gender and date of birth | On the day before the marriage |
| Fee status | If no fee is attached, state that the fee will be sent upon invoicing or that no fee applies |

> This data is submitted either on a **form established by the central registry** or in an **agreed-upon electronic format**.

---

### **5. Handling of Transfers Between Courts**

If a divorce proceeding is **transferred** from one court to another:

#### **(a) New Registry Number**
- The **new court’s registrar** assigns a new divorce registry number that follows the sequence of the last number assigned by that court.

#### **(b) Information to Be Provided (within 7 days)**
The transferring registrar must provide the central registry with:

| Information Item | Details |
|------------------|--------|
| Court number and divorce registry number of the **transferring court** |
| Court number and province of the **new court** |
| Date of transfer |
| Date of marriage |
| For each spouse: role, surname, given names, gender, and date of birth |

> Again, this information must be submitted via an official form or electronic format, signed and dated by the registrar.

---

### **6. Processing of Submitted Information by the Central Registry**

Upon receiving the information, the central registry performs the following steps:

#### **(a) Verification of Completeness and Accuracy**
- Checks whether all required information is present.
- If missing or incorrect, **requests correction or completion** from the registrar within 7 days.

#### **(b) Sequence Validation**
- Verifies that the divorce registry number is in **sequential order**.
- If not, **requests an explanation** from the registrar within 7 days, or requires correction.

#### **(c) Entry into the Central Record**
- Once the information is complete, accurate, and properly sequenced, it is **entered into the central database**.

---

### **7. Notification to Registries of Pending or Existing Divorce Proceedings**

After receiving a new application, the central registry checks its records to determine:

- Whether **another divorce proceeding is pending** between the same spouses.
- Whether a **divorce has already been granted** for that marriage.

#### **Notifications Sent Based on Findings:**

| Scenario | Notification Sent To |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Another divorce proceeding is pending** (even if filed in different courts) | To the **registrars of all courts** where the applications were filed (if filed on different days) <br> OR to **all registrars** and the **Registry of the Federal Court** (if filed on the same day) |
| **A divorce has already been granted** | To the **registrar of the court** where the current application was filed |
| **No pending proceedings and no prior divorce** | To the **registrar of the court** where the application was filed |

> The notification is **valid for six years** from the date it is issued.

#### **Renewal of Notifications**
- If the divorce proceeding is **not dismissed or discontinued**, and no final judgment has been issued:
  - The **registrar of the court of competent jurisdiction** can request a **renewal** of the notification.
  - The central registry will issue a renewed notification valid for another **six years**.

> This ensures that the registry remains updated and active during the duration of the case.

---

### **8. Registrar Responsibilities Upon Receiving a Notification**

When a registrar receives a notification from the central registry:

- Must **place the notification with the relevant application file**.
- Must **inform the applicant (spouse who filed)** if:
  - There is **another pending divorce** between the spouses, or
  - A **divorce has already been granted**.

This ensures that applicants are fully informed and can avoid duplicative or invalid applications.

---

### **9. Information to Be Submitted Upon Transfer or Case Closure**

#### **(a) Upon Transfer**
- Within 7 days of transfer, the **transferring court’s registrar** must provide:
  - Court number and divorce registry number of the transferring court
  - Province and (if known) court number of the receiving court
  - Surname and given names of each spouse on the day before marriage

#### **(b) Upon Discontinuance or Final Judgment**
- Within 7 days after:
  - The case is **discontinued**, or
  - A judgment is **dismissed or granted**
- The registrar must send to the central registry:
  - Court number and divorce registry number
  - Surname and given names of each spouse
  - Outcome of the proceeding (discontinuance, dismissal, or grant)
  - Date when the proceeding ended or judgment took effect

> All such information must be submitted via an official form or electronic format, signed by the registrar.

---

### **10. Presumption of Discontinuance (Record Keeping Rule)**

For the **sole purpose of record keeping**, the central registry will **presume a divorce proceeding has been discontinued** if:

- It does **not receive** the required information under subsection 7(2), or
- It does **not receive** a request for renewal of the notification within the **six-year period**.

> This is a **presumption**, not a legal conclusion. It means the registry will treat the case as inactive after six years, unless evidence to the contrary is provided.
