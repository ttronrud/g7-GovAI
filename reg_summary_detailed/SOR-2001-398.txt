## 📊 Valuation of Interests in Real Property

### General Rule (Sections 8–12)
For the purposes of sections 8 to 12 of the TLC Act, the **book value** of an interest in real property is determined based on:
- **Real property**: Gross book value minus accumulated depreciation (as per the Superintendent’s accounting principles under subsection 313(4) of the TLC Act).
- **Securities or loans**: Book value as reported on the company’s balance sheet under the same accounting standards.

> This ensures consistency in valuation using standardized financial reporting practices.
