### **Overview**

The *Westbank First Nation Land Registry Regulations* establish the administrative framework for the registration and recording of documents affecting Westbank First Nation lands. These regulations are issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, pursuant to the authority granted under **Section 13 of the Westbank First Nation Self-Government Act**. The regulations came into force on **November 5, 2007**, and are designed to ensure transparency, consistency, and legal certainty in land transactions and records within the Westbank First Nation territory.
