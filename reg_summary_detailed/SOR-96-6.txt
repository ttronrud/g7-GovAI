**Detailed Summary of the General Preferential Tariff Reduction Order, 1996**

---

### **Overview**

The *General Preferential Tariff Reduction Order, 1996* is a regulatory instrument issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **section 35 of the Customs Tariff** (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)). This Order amends the **General Preferential Tariff (GPT)** provisions in the Customs Tariff to reduce customs duty rates for certain imported goods, with specific rules governing how and when reductions take effect.

The Order is effective **January 1, 1996**, and applies to specific tariff items listed in **Schedules I to IV** of the Order. It introduces tiered reduction mechanisms, with different treatment depending on the schedule and the nature of the tariff item.

### **Key Provisions and Application by Schedule**

---

#### **Schedule I: Direct Reduction of Duty Rates**

**Provision:**  
For each tariff item number listed in **Column I** of Schedule I, the existing **General Preferential Tariff (GPT) rate** is reduced to the rate specified in **Column II** of that item.

**Effect:**  
- A direct, fixed reduction of duty rates for specific goods.
- The new rate becomes effective **January 1, 1996**.
- No further adjustments are made after this date unless otherwise specified.

**Example:**  
If a product under tariff item 8516.30 has a GPT rate of 5% and is reduced to 2% in Column II, the new duty rate of 2% applies immediately.

---

#### **Schedule II: Rate Reduction with a Two-Part Formula (Conditional Adjustment)**

**Provision:**  
For each tariff item in **Column I of Schedule II**, the GPT rate is reduced to the **greater of two values**:

1. The rate specified in **Column II** of that item (the "direct rate").
2. The **lesser of two values**:
   - The previous GPT rate as of **December 31, 1995**, **reduced by 1%** (and any fractional percentage).
   - Two-thirds of the **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) rate** applicable to that item, **reduced by any fraction of a per cent**.

**Effective Date:**  
January 1, 1996.

**Key Mechanism:**  
This ensures that the new GPT rate is not lower than:
- A 1% reduction from the prior year’s GPT rate, and  
- Two-thirds of the MFN rate (a benchmark for fair trade treatment).

The rate is set as the **higher** of these two options, protecting the GPT rate from dropping below a reasonable floor.

**Annual Adjustment Clause (Post-1996):**  
If the rate derived from the two-part formula (paragraph 1(b)) is **greater than** the direct rate (paragraph 1(a)), then:
- The higher rate is **reduced by 1% each year** on January 1, starting in 1997.
- This reduction continues **until the difference between the two rates is less than 1%**.
- Once the difference falls below 1%, the **lower rate (from paragraph 1(a))** becomes the applicable GPT rate.

**Purpose:**  
This mechanism ensures that preferential treatment does not gradually erode over time and provides a gradual convergence toward the more favorable (lower) rate, preventing excessive preferential advantage.

#### **Schedule III: Replacement of "X" with a Specific Rate**

**Provision:**  
For each tariff item in **Column I of Schedule III**, the symbol **"X"** (which previously indicated no duty under the GPT) in the **"General Preferential Tariff" column of Schedule I to the Customs Tariff** is **replaced** with the rate specified in **Column II** of that item.

**Effect:**  
- Goods previously eligible for zero or no duty under GPT now have a **specific, positive duty rate**.
- This effectively **removes the preferential status** for those items and replaces it with a defined duty rate.
- Effective January 1, 1996.

**Implication:**  
This marks a shift from full preferential treatment (duty-free) to a **limited preferential rate**, signaling a policy of reducing or eliminating preferential access for certain goods.

---

#### **Schedule IV: Rate Determination Based on MFN and Direct Rate (with Annual Adjustment)**

**Provision:**  
For each tariff item in **Column I of Schedule IV**, the GPT rate is replaced by the **greater of**:
1. The rate in **Column II** of that item (direct rate), or  
2. Two-thirds of the **MFN rate**, reduced by any fraction of a per cent.

**Effective Date:**  
January 1, 1996.

**Annual Adjustment Clause (Post-1996):**  
If the rate derived from the two-part formula (paragraph 1(b)) is **greater than** the direct rate (paragraph 1(a)), then:
- The higher rate is **reduced by 1% annually** on January 1, starting in 1997.
- This continues until the difference between the two rates is **less than 1%**.
- At that point, the **lower rate (from paragraph 1(a))** becomes the GPT rate.

**Purpose:**  
Similar to Schedule II, this ensures that preferential rates are not excessively high relative to MFN rates and are gradually adjusted downward over time.

### **Key Features and Policy Implications**

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Effective Date** | All changes take effect on **January 1, 1996**. |
| **Gradual Adjustment** | For items where the formula rate exceeds the direct rate, annual 1% reductions apply until the gap is less than 1%. This prevents long-term preferential advantages. |
| **MFN Rate Benchmark** | The use of **two-thirds of the MFN rate** establishes a cap on how favorable the GPT rate can be, ensuring it does not exceed a reasonable threshold. |
| **Prevention of Unfair Advantage** | The structure prevents GPT rates from becoming excessively low or unfair compared to standard trade terms. |
| **Flexibility** | Different treatment based on schedule allows for targeted policy responses — some items get direct reductions, others are subject to formulas. |
| **Transparency** | The formulaic approach provides clear rules for determining the final rate, improving predictability for importers and exporters. |

### **Summary Table of Schedules**

| Schedule | Action | Key Rule | Adjustment Mechanism |
|--------|--------|---------|------------------------|
| I | Direct rate reduction | Replace GPT rate with Column II rate | None after 1996 |
| II | Conditional rate (with floor) | Greater of (Column II) or (lesser of: prior GPT –1%, 2/3 MFN) | Annual 1% reduction if formula rate > direct rate; stops when difference <1% |
| III | Replace "X" with rate | Replace "X" with Column II rate | No further adjustment |
| IV | Conditional rate (with floor) | Greater of (Column II) or (2/3 MFN) | Annual 1% reduction if formula rate > direct rate; stops when difference <1% |

### **Conclusion**

The *General Preferential Tariff Reduction Order, 1996* represents a **targeted and structured approach** to adjusting customs duty preferences for specific imported goods. It:

- Reduces preferential treatment in a transparent, rule-based manner,
- Prevents excessive or unsustainable preferential advantages,
- Aligns GPT rates with international trade norms (via the MFN benchmark),
- Introduces a **gradual convergence mechanism** to ensure fairness over time,
- Balances immediate relief for certain goods with long-term economic sustainability.

This Order reflects a deliberate policy shift toward **greater tariff transparency, fairness, and alignment with global trade practices**, while still allowing for targeted support for specific products or sectors.
