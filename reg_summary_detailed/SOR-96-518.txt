## 🚧 Scope and Application

### ✅ Applies to:
- A public servant who:
  - Ceases to be employed in the public service, and  
  - Becomes employed by an airport authority **as a direct result of the transfer of an airport** to that authority.

### ❌ Does NOT Apply to:
1. A person who **subsequently returns to employment** with the **same airport authority** after leaving.
2. A person who becomes employed by a **different airport authority** after leaving the first.
3. A person who **makes an election under paragraph 5(1)(e) of the Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act** on or after the coming into force of these regulations.

> This means the rules only apply to **one-time transitions** from public service to a specific airport authority due to transfer.

---

## ⏳ Exclusions Based on Options Under the Act

### Sections 4 to 11 (General Pension Rules)  
- **Do not apply** to individuals who have exercised an option under **subsection 3(2)** of the PSSA (i.e., those who have chosen a transfer option).

> These provisions are **exempted** for those who have already made a transfer decision.

---

## 📅 Timing of Options and Eligibility

Despite the general rule, **a person who would otherwise be eligible** to exercise certain pension options under the PSSA is **permitted to do so** under specific conditions:

### 1. For **paragraphs 13(7)(a) and (b)** of the PSSA (death benefits for surviving spouse/children):
- Must exercise the option **by June 20, 1998**.

### 2. For **subsection 12(3)** and **section 13.01** of the PSSA (pension or transfer value options):
- Must exercise the option by the **later of**:
  - April 1, 1999  
  - **One year after** the date the person ceases to be employed in the public service and begins employment with the airport authority.

> This creates a **1-year window** for eligible individuals to act after their transition.

---

## 📏 Service and Age Calculations (When Exercising an Option)

When a person exercises an option under the above timeframes, the following rules apply:

### Period of Pensionable Service:
- Is the period of pensionable service **to the person’s credit on the date they ceased public service**.

### Age of the Person:
- If the person ceased public service **on or after April 1, 1998**:
  - Age is that of the person **on the date of leaving public service**.
- In **all other cases**:
  - Age is that of the person on **April 1, 1998**.

> This ensures that individuals who transitioned after April 1, 1998, are assessed using their actual age at departure.

---

## 💰 Valuation Date (for Transfer Value)

Under **section 13.01 of the PSSA** and **sections 83–99 of the Public Service Superannuation Regulations**:

- For those who ceased public service **on or after April 1, 1998**:
  - **Valuation day** = the **later** of:
    - The date of ceasing public service  
    - The date on which the option for transfer value is exercised
- For all others:
  - **Valuation date** = the date the option is exercised

> This ensures that valuation reflects the **actual timing** of the transition and option exercise.

---

## 🔒 Non-Exclusivity of Options

> A person who has exercised an option under subsection (2) (i.e., the special time-limited option) **cannot** later exercise an option under subsection (1) (the general option) when they cease employment with the airport authority.

> This prevents **double-eligibility** and ensures a **clear, single path** for pension or transfer decisions.

---

## 🏥 Death Benefits (Surviving Spouse & Children)

For a person who dies while employed by an airport authority:

- **Death Benefit**: Surviving spouse and children are entitled to a **return of contributions** (as per subsection 12(8) of the PSSA).
- **Allowance**: Surviving spouse and children are entitled to an allowance under **paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b)** of the PSSA, **subject to limitations** in subsections 12(4) and (5).

> These benefits are **extended to cover the period of employment with the airport authority**, ensuring continuity of family support.

---

## 👶 Child Allowance (Stepchildren & Adopted Children)

A child who:
- Was **born to**, **adopted by**, or **became a stepchild** of the public servant  
- During the period **from the date of ceasing public service to the date of ceasing employment with the airport authority**

> Is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the PSSA** (i.e., the general child allowance provisions).

> This protects **family continuity** during the transition period.

---

## ⏱️ One-Year Period for Certain Benefits

Under **subsection 10(5)** of the PSSA:
- The **one-year period** (for certain benefits such as spousal or child allowances) begins on the **date the person ceases employment with the airport authority**, not the date of leaving public service.

> This aligns the benefit window with the **new employment period**.

---

## 📚 Pensionable Service and Age (Under Sections 12, 13, 16, 17)

- **Pensionable service** includes:
  - The period of service with the airport authority that begins on the date of ceasing public service and ends on the date of ceasing employment with that airport authority.

- **Age of the person when ceasing public service**:
  - Is defined as the person’s age on the **day they cease employment with the airport authority**.

> This ensures that service and age are calculated based on **actual employment with the airport**, not public service.

---

## ⚠️ Voluntary vs. Involuntary Cessation

> **Ceasing employment otherwise than voluntarily** in operational service **does not include** ceasing employment due to the **transfer of an airport to an airport authority**.

> This means:
- A public servant who leaves due to airport transfer is **not considered to have resigned voluntarily**.
- The transfer itself is treated as a **non-voluntary cessation** for pension purposes.
- This protects the individual from losing pension rights due to a change in employer status.

---

## 🏷️ Group Classification

- All contributors to whom these regulations apply are considered **Group 1 contributors** under the PSSA.

> This classification determines eligibility for certain pension plans and benefits under the PSSA.

---

## 📅 Effective Date

- The regulations **came into force on December 1, 1996**.

> This means all provisions apply from that date onward, even if the transfer of airports occurred earlier.
