**Regulatory Summary: Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2021-947 and Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities as the Minister for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, in accordance with Section 2 of the *Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act* (R.S., c. C-7). Section 2 of the Act defines the term "Minister" as the individual responsible for overseeing the operations and administration of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). This provision ensures that the Act is administered by a designated federal minister, providing clarity and accountability in governance.

**2. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2021-947**  
The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2021-947, issued on October 26, 2021. This prior order had previously designated a different minister as the Minister responsible for the CMHC. The repeal signifies the end of that earlier designation, effectively removing the previous administrative assignment and invalidating its provisions.

This action reflects a change in ministerial responsibility, likely due to a reorganization of federal government departments or a shift in policy priorities. The repeal ensures that the current ministerial designation is legally effective and aligned with the current government structure.

**3. Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities**  
Under this regulation, the **Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** is formally designated as the Minister for the purposes of the *Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act*. This designation is made effective through the use of a Statutory Instrument (SI/2021-92), which serves as the legal mechanism for such appointments under Canadian administrative law.

The Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is also recognized as a member of the **King’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal recognition of the individual’s status as a senior federal official with the authority to participate in the governance of the Crown and to act on behalf of the government in certain official capacities.

**4. Legal and Practical Implications**  
- **Administrative Continuity**: The designation ensures that the CMHC continues to operate under the leadership of a clearly defined minister, providing stability and continuity in policy implementation.  
- **Departmental Alignment**: The transfer of responsibility to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities reflects a strategic alignment between housing policy and broader infrastructure and community development goals. This reflects a growing emphasis on integrated housing and infrastructure planning.  
- **Legal Validity**: The designation is binding under the Act and must be respected by all government departments and officials involved in CMHC operations, including financial oversight, policy development, and program delivery.  
- **Accountability**: The new minister is now directly accountable to Parliament for the performance and direction of the CMHC, ensuring transparency and responsiveness to public interest in affordable housing and housing stability.

**5. Purpose and Intent**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to update the official ministerial responsibility for the CMHC in line with current government structure and policy direction. It streamlines administrative oversight and ensures that housing policy is coordinated with broader infrastructure and community development strategies.

This move may also signal a renewed focus on addressing housing affordability, affordability initiatives, and sustainable community development through the CMHC’s mandate.

**6. Effective Date and Implementation**  
While the specific effective date is not explicitly stated in the provided text, such designations typically take effect immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette and upon being formally adopted by the Governor in Council. The repeal of P.C. 2021-947 and the new designation would thus become effective upon the publication of this regulation in the official government journal.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation marks a significant administrative update to the governance of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. By repealing an outdated ministerial designation and formally assigning responsibility to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, the government ensures that housing policy is now aligned with broader infrastructure and community development priorities. The change reinforces accountability, enhances coordination, and reflects a strategic reorientation of federal housing policy under current government leadership.
