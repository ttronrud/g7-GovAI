The regulation referenced — "[Repealed, SOR/2012-99, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been formally repealed by the **Supplemental Orders and Regulations (SOR/2012-99)**, under **section 1** of that document.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable. It was officially removed from the legal framework by the enactment of SOR/2012-99, section 1.

- **Repeal Source**:  
  The repeal is found in **SOR/2012-99, section 1**, which is a statutory instrument issued by the Government of Canada under the authority of a relevant federal statute (such as the *Canada Labour Code*, *Fisheries Act*, or another applicable act). The exact parent statute must be identified based on the context of SOR/2012-99, which is a collection of regulatory amendments and repeals.

- **Purpose of the Original Regulation (Inferred)**:  
  While the specific content of the repealed regulation is not provided, regulations that are repealed through SOR/2012-99 typically relate to areas such as:
  - Labour standards (e.g., workplace safety, working hours)
  - Environmental protection
  - Fisheries management
  - Transportation or licensing
  - Health and safety in specific industries  
  The exact subject matter would depend on the original regulation being repealed.

- **Effective Date of Repeal**:  
  The repeal became effective upon the publication of SOR/2012-99 in the Canada Gazette, which usually occurs within a few days of the regulation’s issuance. The effective date is generally the date of publication unless otherwise specified.

- **Legal Consequence of Repeal**:  
  Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions previously established by the repealed regulation are no longer enforceable. Entities or individuals previously subject to those rules must now comply with any successor regulations or the applicable statute as amended.

- **Public Access**:  
  The full text of SOR/2012-99, including section 1, can be accessed through official government sources such as:
  - [CanLII (Canadian Legal Information Institute)](https://www.canlii.org)
  - [Government of Canada – Regulations and Orders](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-public-services.html)
  - [Canada Gazette](https://www.canada.ca/en/gazette.html)

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer in effect** due to being formally repealed by **SOR/2012-99, section 1**. It was removed from the regulatory framework, and its provisions are superseded by either a new regulation or the underlying statute. Without the original text of the repealed regulation, the specific details of its content, scope, and application cannot be fully reconstructed. To understand the full context, one must consult the original regulation or the detailed text of SOR/2012-99.
