**Detailed Summary of the Multi-Sector Air Pollutants Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Overview and Legal Basis**

The *Multi-Sector Air Pollutants Regulations* are a set of environmental regulations enacted under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**. These regulations were formally issued by **His Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, pursuant to **subsections 93(1)** and **330(3.2)d** of CEPA 1999.

This regulatory action follows a formal and transparent process:
- A **proposed regulation** was published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **June 7, 2014**, allowing stakeholders to submit **comments or objections**.
- The **National Advisory Committee** was given the opportunity to provide expert advice under **section 6c** of CEPA 1999.
- The Governor in Council concluded, pursuant to **subsection 93(4)**, that the proposed regulations do **not overlap with or duplicate existing environmental protections** under other federal or provincial laws and that they provide **adequate protection to human health and the environment**.

Thus, the regulations were finalized and adopted to establish **national standards for emissions of key air pollutants**, specifically **nitrogen oxides (NOx)** and **sulfur dioxide (SO₂)**, from industrial sources.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of the regulations is to **protect human health and the environment** by setting **emission limits** for specific pollutants from major industrial sources. These limits are designed to reduce air pollution, particularly in areas where emissions contribute to smog, acid rain, respiratory illness, and climate change.

The regulations apply to **multiple sectors** and cover a range of equipment and processes, with a focus on **stationary combustion sources**.

---

### **Key Emission Controls by Sector**

The regulations divide their requirements into **four main parts**, each targeting different types of industrial facilities and emissions.

---

#### **Part 1: NOx Emissions from Boilers and Heaters**

- **Applies to**: Boilers and heaters in **regulated industrial facilities** across various sectors.
- **Pollutant**: Nitrogen oxides (NOx), defined as the sum of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).
- **Scope**:
  - Excludes boilers used solely for electricity generation.
  - Covers facilities in sectors such as:
    - Iron and steel production
    - Aluminum manufacturing
    - Cement production
    - Chemicals
    - Pulp and paper
    - Base metals (e.g., copper, nickel)
- **Emission Limits**: Specific NOx emission limits are established based on facility type, size, and operating conditions.
- **Monitoring Requirement**: Facilities must use **Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS)** to verify compliance.

---

#### **Part 2: NOx Emissions from Stationary Spark-Ignition Engines**

- **Applies to**: Stationary spark-ignition engines that burn **gaseous fuels** (e.g., natural gas, biogas) in industrial settings.
- **Pollutant**: NOx only.
- **Scope**:
  - Engines must be stationary (not in self-propelled machines).
  - Must operate under conditions similar to the theoretical Otto cycle.
  - Must use spark plugs or other sparking devices.
- **Facilities Covered**:
  - Gas processing plants
  - Waste-to-energy plants
  - Industrial process heating
  - Facilities using natural gas for backup or auxiliary power
- **Emission Limits**: NOx limits are set according to engine size, fuel type, and operational parameters.
- **Monitoring Requirement**: CEMS required for compliance with emission limits.

---

#### **Part 3: NOx and SO₂ Emissions from Cement Manufacturing Facilities**

- **Applies to**: All cement manufacturing facilities that produce **clinker**.
- **Pollutants**: Both **NOx** and **SO₂**.
- **Emission Limits**:
  - Specific, enforceable limits are established for both pollutants.
  - Limits are based on facility capacity and process type.
- **Rationale**: Cement production is a significant source of NOx and SO₂, contributing to acid rain and respiratory health risks.
- **Monitoring Requirement**: CEMS required to ensure accurate and ongoing measurement of emissions.

---

#### **Part 4: General Rules on Monitoring and Reporting**

This part establishes the **technical and administrative framework** for compliance, including:

1. **CEMS Reference Method**:
   - Defines which methods govern CEMS use.
   - Two primary reference methods are recognized:
     - **EC CEMS Code** (European Commission, 2005): The primary reference standard for monitoring emissions from thermal power generation.
     - **Alberta CEMS Code** (1998): A provincial standard adopted as a secondary reference.
   - The EC CEMS Code takes precedence unless otherwise specified.

2. **Alternative Methods**:
   - Allows the use of **alternative methods** to those incorporated by reference, **provided** they meet or exceed the performance standards of the reference methods.
   - These alternatives must be approved by the Minister of the Environment.

3. **Reporting, Recording, and Retention Requirements**:
   - Operators must:
     - Maintain detailed records of emissions data.
     - Submit reports to the relevant environmental authority.
     - Retain records for a minimum period (typically **five years**).
   - Records must be accurate, complete, and verifiable.
   - Data must be stored in a way that allows for audit and inspection.

4. **Interpretation of Incorporated Documents**:
   - Any reference to **“should”** in incorporated documents (e.g., EPA or ASTM standards) is interpreted as **“must”**.
   - Any **recommendation or suggestion** is treated as an **obligation**, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
   - The **accuracy and precision** of measurements are strictly required — no context can justify lower standards.

5. **Application of U.S. EPA Methods**:
   - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods (e.g., EPA Method 1, 2, 3A, 4, 6C, 7E) are incorporated by reference.
   - These methods are applied **without reference to EPA discretion** — they are binding and must be followed exactly.

### **Definitions of Key Terms**

The regulations define numerous technical terms to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 |
| **Boiler** | Combustion equipment used to transfer thermal energy to water or steam (not for electricity generation only) |

| **Engine** | Stationary spark-ignition engine operating under Otto cycle conditions |
| **Gaseous fuel** | Fuel that is gaseous at 15.6°C and 101.325 kPa |
| **Gasoline** | Defined by specific vapour pressure, antiknock index, and distillation ranges |
