The provided text appears to be a **repealed regulation** related to the **prohibition of chemical and conventional weapons**, specifically under the **Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)**. However, the content is **not a coherent, standalone regulation** as presented — it is a **list of items that have been repealed**, followed by a **detailed list of prohibited substances**, including weapons, toxic chemicals, precursors, and mixtures, with references to the CWC and CAS numbers.

Below is a **detailed, accurate, and structured summary** of the **substance and intent** of this regulation — even though it has been **repealed**, as the content reflects what was previously legally binding.

## 🔍 Detailed Summary of the Repealed Regulation

### 📌 General Overview

This regulation, now **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or replaced), was designed to **prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, use, and transfer** of certain **conventional weapons** and **chemical weapons** under the **Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)**, adopted in 1992.

It outlines specific categories of **prohibited goods**, including:

- Small arms and large-calibre weapons
- Components and parts of such weapons
- Toxic chemicals and their precursors classified under CWC Schedules 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B
- Mixtures containing these substances
- Exclusions for consumer goods

The regulation also defines key terms such as **CWC** and **CAS**, and includes **specific chemical names and CAS numbers** for precision in identification.
