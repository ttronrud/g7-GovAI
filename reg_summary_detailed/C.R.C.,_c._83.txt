**Detailed Summary of the Gander International Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled:  
**"Gander International Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and are designed to establish spatial and structural constraints around Gander International Airport in the District of Gander-Twillingate, Province of Newfoundland.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical geographic and technical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**:  
  Refers specifically to **Gander International Airport**, located in the District of Gander-Twillingate, Newfoundland.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A precise geographic point defined in **Part I of the Schedule**. For regulatory purposes, this point is **deemed to be at 450 feet above sea level**, regardless of actual elevation at the time of measurement.

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (strip), perpendicular to its centerline. It ensures clear visual and navigational access for aircraft during approach.  
  - Described in **Part III of the Schedule**.  
  - Specific ratios and dimensions vary by runway:
    - Runways **04-22** and **14-32**: 1 foot vertical per 50 feet horizontal (1:50 slope).
    - Runway **09-27**: 1 foot vertical per 40 feet horizontal (1:40 slope).  
  - Each surface rises to a horizontal line 1,000 feet above the end of the strip (for 04-22/14-32) or 200 feet (for 09-27), extending 50,000 feet or 10,000 feet horizontally, with outer ends at 8,000 or 1,250 feet from the centerline, respectively.

- **Outer Surface**:  
  An imaginary surface that forms a boundary around the entire airport area. It is designed to protect aircraft from visual obstructions and ensure safe flight paths.  
  - Composed of:
    - A **common plane at 150 feet above the ARP elevation**.
    - If this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, a **30-foot surface above ground** is used instead.  
  - This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any object within the airport’s outer zone.

- **Strip**:  
  The designated rectangular area of the runway used for takeoff and landing, including the runway and its immediate approach zones.  
  - Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**:
    - **Runway 04-22**: 1,000 ft wide (500 ft on each side), 10,900 ft long.
    - **Runway 09-27**: 500 ft wide (250 ft on each side), 6,580 ft long.
    - **Runway 14-32**: 1,000 ft wide (500 ft on each side), 9,300 ft long.

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending outward from the lateral edges of each strip and its associated approach surface. It connects the approach surface to the outer surface and prevents obstructions from interfering with aircraft navigation.  
  - Slope: 1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal (1:7).
  - Extends upward and outward until it intersects with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:
- All **land and underwater areas** (including public road allowances),
- Adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport,
- Within the **outer limits defined in Part II of the Schedule**.

**Exception**:  
The regulations **do not apply** to land that is **formally incorporated into the airport** (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or airport-owned facilities).

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:
- **Erect, construct, or add to** any building, structure, or object on land covered by these regulations,  
- **If the highest point of that object exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at the location of the object**:
  - Approach surfaces,
  - Outer surface,
  - Transitional surfaces.

This means all structures (including trees, towers, antennas, or buildings) must remain **below** the maximum allowable height defined by these surfaces at every point on the land.

> **Purpose**: To ensure unobstructed visibility and safe flight operations for aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.

---

### **5. Prohibition of Interference with Aeronautical Operations**

No owner or lessee may:
- Use or develop any part of the regulated land in a way that:
  - **Interferes with signals or communications** to or from aircraft, or
  - **Disrupts aeronautical service facilities** (e.g., radar, navigation aids, control towers).

> **Purpose**: To maintain reliable and uninterrupted communication and surveillance systems essential for aviation safety.

---

### **6. Management of Natural Growth**

If natural vegetation (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land grows **above the elevation of any of the surfaces defined in Section 5**, the **Minister of Transport** may:
- Require the **owner or lessee** to **remove the excess growth**.

> **Purpose**: To prevent natural obstructions from compromising aircraft visibility or signal integrity.

---

### **7. Geographic Boundaries and Reference Points**

#### **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located **500 feet southeast** of the intersection of runway 09-27 and runway 04-22, measured at right angles to the centerline of runway 09-27.
- Measured **3,500 feet along the centerline of runway 09-27** from its intersection with runway 04-22.

#### **Outer Area (Circular Zone)**
- A **circular area with a radius of 13,000 feet**, centered at the ARP.

This zone defines the overall perimeter within which height restrictions and operational rules apply.

---

### **8. Regulatory Documentation and Reference**

All defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional, and strips) are **graphically illustrated** in:
- **Department of Transport Plan MT-1593**, dated **August 25, 1975**.

This plan serves as the **primary reference document** for determining the exact shape, dimensions, and locations of all regulatory surfaces.

---

### **9. Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Ensure Flight Safety**:  
   Prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

2. **Maintain Communication and Navigation Integrity**:  
   Protect critical aeronautical infrastructure from interference.

3. **Preserve Visual and Radio Line-of-Sight**:  
   Guarantee clear visibility and signal propagation for pilots and air traffic control.

4. **Enforce Consistent Zoning**:  
   Apply uniform height and development standards across all land adjacent to the airport.

5. **Provide Legal Authority**:  
   Empower the Minister of Transport to enforce compliance, including removal of excessive vegetation.

---

### **10. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directives regarding height limits.
  - Require removal of overgrown vegetation.
  - Enforce compliance through administrative action.

This gives the government a clear mechanism to uphold aviation safety standards.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Gander International Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive framework to protect the airport environment from physical and operational interference. By defining precise geometric boundaries (approach, outer, transitional surfaces), setting strict height limits, and prohibiting interference with aviation systems, the regulations ensure that Gander International Airport remains safe, efficient, and compliant with national aviation standards.

These rules are grounded in technical precision, spatial planning, and operational necessity, and are supported by a detailed plan (MT-1593) that provides visual and measurable reference for all stakeholders — including landowners, developers, and aviation authorities.

**Note**: These regulations are **not retroactive** and apply only to land within the defined boundaries and under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Transport. Any changes to the airport layout or surrounding land would require review and potential amendment of the schedule.
