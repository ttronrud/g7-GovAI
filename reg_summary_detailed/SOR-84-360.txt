**Detailed Summary of the African Development Bank Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *African Development Bank Privileges and Immunities Order* is a Canadian regulatory instrument enacted under the authority of the *Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act* (S.C. 1974–75–76, c. 69, s. 2). It grants specific legal and operational privileges and immunities to the **African Development Bank (AfDB)** and its representatives, officials, and experts while they are operating in Canada.

This Order is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**, and is directly derived from international legal frameworks, particularly the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations* (the "Convention").

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- **Statutory Authority**: The Order is made under **Section 3** of the *Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act*, which empowers the federal government to grant privileges and immunities to international organizations and their personnel.
- **International Framework**: The Order aligns with the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, which sets out standardized rights and protections for UN entities and their personnel. The AfDB is granted similar rights under the Convention, based on its status as a regional international organization with a structure and function comparable to the UN.

> - Search and seizure,
> - Taxation,
> - Civil and criminal liability,

#### **2. Representatives of Member States (Government Delegates)**

- Representatives of **member states** of the AfDB (i.e., government officials or diplomatic envoys) shall have in Canada:

### **Important Limitations and Exceptions**

- **No Exemption from Taxation or Liability for Canadian Citizens**:
  - **Crucially**, the Order explicitly states that **nothing in this Order exempts a Canadian citizen** (whether residing or ordinarily resident in Canada) from:
    - Liability for debts,
    - Taxes,
    - Duties imposed under Canadian law.

> This means that if a Canadian citizen is acting as a representative, official, or expert for the AfDB, they remain fully subject to Canadian tax laws and legal obligations. The privileges and immunities granted are **not extended to individuals who are Canadian citizens**, and such individuals are not protected from taxation or legal action.

> This provision ensures that Canadian law remains fully enforceable and that Canadian citizens are not shielded from accountability.

4. **Balances National Interests**: By explicitly excluding Canadian citizens from immunity, the Order maintains Canada’s sovereignty and fiscal accountability.
