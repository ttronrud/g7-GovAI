**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Prohibiting the Issuance of Interests at Rampart House in the Yukon Territory

**Legal Authority:**  
This order was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, pursuant to **subsection 10(1) of the Canada Petroleum Resources Act (R.S., c. 36 (2nd Supp.))**. This provision allows the federal government to regulate or restrict the issuance of land interests in certain areas where public or historic values are at stake.

---

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **prohibit the issuance of any land interests** (such as mineral rights, surface rights, or other forms of ownership or proprietary interests) in specific frontier lands designated as a **Historic Site**. The decision is based on the recognition of the cultural, historical, and heritage significance of the site.

---

**Scope of the Prohibited Interests:**  
- No interests—whether fee simple, leasehold, mineral rights, or any other form—may be issued in respect of the following lands:  
  - **The whole of Lots 1 and 2, Group 1301**, in the Yukon Territory.  
  - These lots are specifically described as the **Rampart House Historic Site**.  
  - The exact boundaries of these lots are defined by **Plan of Survey of Record No. 35102**, which is held in the Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa.

---

**Key Exemptions (Saving Provisions):**  
Despite the general prohibition, the following areas are **exempt** from the restriction:  
1. **Part of Rampart House situated within 60 feet of the Canada–United States (Yukon–Alaska) international boundary.**  
   - This exemption recognizes the need for access or management related to the international border, possibly for administrative, security, or diplomatic reasons.  
2. **Any part of Lot 1, Group 1301**, that has already been granted **fee simple title**.  
   - This means that if any portion of Lot 1 already has full ownership rights (fee simple), those rights are not subject to the prohibition.  
   - The exemption applies only to land where fee simple title has been legally established and registered.

> *Note: The exemption does not extend to any other land within the group or to future interests being issued.*

---

**Effective Date:**  
The Order comes into force on **December 4, 1997**. All prohibitions and restrictions apply from this date onward.

---

**Regulatory Context and Significance:**  
- This order reflects the federal government’s role in protecting **cultural heritage sites** under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act, even in areas where petroleum or resource development might otherwise be considered.  
- The designation of Rampart House as a Historic Site underscores its importance in Canadian history—likely tied to early exploration, Indigenous presence, or frontier settlement.  
- By prohibiting the issuance of interests, the government prevents potential development or privatization that could threaten the site’s integrity or historical value.  
- The exemption for land near the international boundary and for land with existing fee simple title ensures that practical land-use needs are not entirely eliminated, while still preserving the core heritage protection.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a legally binding instrument that protects the **Rampart House Historic Site** in the Yukon Territory from unauthorized land interest development. It balances heritage conservation with practical land-use considerations by allowing limited exceptions for border-related access and existing property titles. The order demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to preserving significant historical locations, even in the context of resource management and land use planning.
