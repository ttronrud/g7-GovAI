**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Canadian Firearms Centre to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207). This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the authority to transfer control and supervision of certain portions of federal public administration from one department or agency to another, particularly in the context of public service restructuring or administrative efficiency.

**Key Provisions of the Regulation:**

1. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**  
   The regulation formally transfers from the *Canadian Firearms Centre* (CFC) to the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police* (RCMP) the **control and supervision** of all portions of the federal public administration that fall within the Canadian Firearms Centre.

2. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **May 17, 2006**. This date marks the point at which the RCMP assumes full administrative, operational, and supervisory responsibility for the functions and personnel previously managed by the Canadian Firearms Centre.

3. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer is not a dissolution or reorganization of the Canadian Firearms Centre as an entity, but rather a shift in **administrative oversight**. The CFC continues to exist as a functional unit, but its day-to-day operations, management, and supervision are now exercised by the RCMP. This includes responsibilities related to firearms licensing, safety, regulation, and enforcement — functions traditionally handled by the CFC.

4. **Rationale (Implied Context):**  
   The transfer was likely driven by strategic government decisions to consolidate firearms-related authority under a single, well-resourced, and trusted law enforcement agency. The RCMP, as Canada’s national police force with established expertise in law enforcement and public safety, was deemed better positioned to manage firearms regulation, oversight, and compliance across Canada.

5. **Legal Basis and Process:**  
   The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which enables the federal government to restructure public service responsibilities. The Governor General in Council acts on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, reflecting a formal and constitutionally sound process for such administrative changes.

6. **Impact on Operations:**  
   - The RCMP assumes responsibility for policy development, staffing, budgeting, and performance monitoring of the CFC’s activities.  
   - The CFC continues to carry out its mandate — such as issuing firearms licences, conducting safety inspections, and providing firearms safety education — but now under the operational and administrative umbrella of the RCMP.  
   - This transfer enhances coordination between firearms regulation and law enforcement, potentially improving consistency and responsiveness in public safety.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within Canada’s federal public service. It transfers the control and supervision of the Canadian Firearms Centre to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, effective May 17, 2006. The move consolidates firearms regulation under a single, authoritative law enforcement body, aiming to improve efficiency, accountability, and public safety. The regulation is legally grounded in the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* and reflects a strategic shift in how Canada manages firearms-related responsibilities within its federal institutions.
