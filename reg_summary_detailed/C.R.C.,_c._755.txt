**Detailed Summary of the Defence Production and Development Sharing Remission Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Defence Production and Development Sharing Remission Order* and may be cited accordingly. It establishes a specific tax remission provision for certain imported or purchased goods used in defence-related activities under bilateral agreements between Canada and the United States.

---

**2. Scope of Remission**  
Under this Order, **excise taxes** (excluding the tax under Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*) are **remitted**—that is, waived or refunded—for the following:

- **Articles and materials** that are:
  - **Imported into Canada** or
  - **Purchased in Canada**

- By **persons carrying on business in Canada** who have been awarded **defence production and development sharing contracts** between the **Government of Canada** and the **Government of the United States**.

- These articles or materials must be used **solely and exclusively** for:
  - The **development and production of goods**, or
  - Being **incorporated into goods** that are ultimately delivered to an **agency of the Government of the United States** under such a defence contract.

> ⚠️ **Important Exclusion**: The remission does **not apply** to taxes under **Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act* (which typically relates to certain fuel or motor vehicle taxes). This ensures that specific tax categories remain unaffected.

**3. Conditions for Claiming Remission**  
To qualify for remission, a claimant must provide the following supporting documentation:

- **Verification by the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)**:  
  A formal confirmation from the CCC that the claimant has been awarded a **defence production and development sharing contract** between Canada and the U.S. government.  
  → This verifies the legitimacy and existence of the contractual relationship.

- **Certificate from the Importer**:  
  A certificate issued by the **importer** of the articles or materials, in a form **prescribed by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue**, stating that:
  - The goods have been **used**, or are **intended to be used**, solely and exclusively for the purposes described in paragraph 2(b) (i.e., development, production, or incorporation into goods delivered to a U.S. government agency).

> This dual verification ensures that the remission is not misapplied to non-defence or commercial purposes.

---

**4. Authority and Flexibility for Implementation**  
The **Minister of National Revenue** has the authority to:
- Issue **instructions and directions** as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of this Order.
- This includes setting procedural rules, clarifying application criteria, or adjusting requirements in response to operational or administrative needs.

> This provision allows for flexibility in enforcement while maintaining the integrity and purpose of the remission.

---

**5. Purpose and Policy Rationale**  
The Order is designed to:
- Facilitate **cooperative defence production** between Canada and the United States.
- Encourage **joint development and manufacturing** of defence-related goods by reducing financial burdens on Canadian businesses participating in such joint ventures.
- Support **national security and international defence partnerships** by enabling cost-effective, efficient production of goods for U.S. government agencies.

By remitting excise taxes on qualifying goods, the government reduces the cost of production and allows Canadian firms to compete effectively in joint defence projects without being disadvantaged by domestic tax obligations.
