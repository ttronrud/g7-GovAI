---

### **Title of the Proclamation**  
*Proclamation Designating the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine as Designated States under the Visiting Forces Act*

---

### **Issuing Authority**  
The Governor General of Canada, **Ramon John Hnatyshyn**, acting on the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**, in the name of **Queen Elizabeth II**, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.

---

### **Date of Issue**  
**May 19, 1993**  
(Referenced in the proclamation as "the nineteenth day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three")

---

### **Legal Basis**  
This proclamation is issued under **Section 4 of the Visiting Forces Act**, which is **Chapter V-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985**.  

Under this section, the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting through the Governor General) has the authority to:  
1. **Designate any country as a "designated state"** for the purposes of the Visiting Forces Act; and  
2. **Declare the extent to which the Act applies** to that designated state.

---

### **Background and Context**  
- On **May 4, 1993**, the Governor in Council issued **Order in Council P.C. 1993-918**, which directed that a proclamation be issued to designate the following five post-Communist Central and Eastern European countries as designated states:  
  - The **Czech Republic**  
  - The **Republic of Hungary**  
  - The **Republic of Poland**  
  - The **Slovak Republic**  
  - **Ukraine**

- This action was part of Canada’s effort to **facilitate the presence of foreign military forces** in these countries, particularly in the context of **post-Cold War security cooperation, regional stability, and international defense arrangements**.

- The designation was made during a period of significant geopolitical transition in Eastern Europe, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Canada sought to maintain clear legal frameworks for the temporary presence of foreign military personnel in these newly independent nations.

### **Key Provisions of the Proclamation**  

#### 1. **Designation of Designated States**  
The Governor General formally **designates** the following five countries as "designated states" under the Visiting Forces Act:  
- Czech Republic  
- Hungary  
- Poland  
- Slovakia  
- Ukraine  

This designation means that the **Visiting Forces Act** will apply to these countries in a manner consistent with Canadian law governing the presence of foreign military forces.

#### 2. **Scope of Application of the Act**  
The Act applies to these designated states **with one important exception**:  
> **Part VI of the Visiting Forces Act is excluded** from application.

- **Part VI** of the Visiting Forces Act typically deals with **military personnel who are subject to Canadian jurisdiction**, including provisions related to **military liability, criminal liability, and the rights of visiting forces in matters of law enforcement or national security**.  
- By excluding Part VI, the Canadian government **does not extend full criminal or legal jurisdiction** over visiting military personnel in these countries — a necessary accommodation to respect the sovereignty of the designated states.

- Therefore, **the rest of the Act (Parts I to V)** applies, which includes provisions on:  
  - The rights and privileges of visiting forces (e.g., access to facilities, freedom of movement, use of property);  
  - Conditions under which visiting forces may be subject to Canadian law;  
  - The requirement for Canadian forces to comply with host nation laws;  
  - Procedures for the treatment of visiting personnel during emergencies or incidents.

### **Purpose and Significance**  

1. **Facilitation of Military Cooperation**  
   - The designation enables Canada to maintain **legal clarity and predictability** in its military engagements with these countries.  
   - It supports **defense cooperation, joint exercises, training, and humanitarian missions** involving Canadian and foreign military forces.

2. **Sovereignty and Diplomatic Sensitivity**  
   - By excluding Part VI, Canada respects the **sovereignty and legal autonomy** of these post-Soviet states.  
   - It avoids imposing Canadian criminal law or jurisdiction over visiting military personnel, which would have been politically and diplomatically unacceptable in the early 1990s.

3. **Post-Cold War Geopolitical Strategy**  
   - This proclamation reflects Canada’s broader foreign policy goal of **engaging with Eastern European nations** as part of a broader European security framework.  
   - It aligns with Canada’s role in **NATO and international peacekeeping efforts**, especially as these countries sought to integrate into Western defense structures.

4. **Legal Continuity and Predictability**  
   - The proclamation provides a **clear, legally binding framework** for how Canadian forces and visiting foreign forces interact in these countries — ensuring consistency and reducing legal ambiguity.

---

### **Legal Effect**  
- The proclamation is **binding on all persons and entities** affected by the Visiting Forces Act.  
- It is **publicly accessible** and must be **taken into account by all government bodies, military personnel, and foreign military authorities** operating in the designated states.  
- It is issued under the **Great Seal of Canada**, affirming its legal authority and validity.

---

### **Formal Language and Signatory**  
- The proclamation is signed by **Ramon John Hnatyshyn**, who held the following official positions at the time:  
  - Governor General of Canada  
  - Member of the Privy Council  
  - Chancellor of the Order of Canada  
  - Commander of the Order of Military Merit  
  - Counsel learned in the law  

- The signing is witnessed by the **Great Seal of Canada**, which affirms the legal validity of the instrument.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This 1993 Proclamation is a **foundational legal instrument** in Canada’s post-Cold War foreign military engagement policy. It formally recognizes the **sovereign status and legal equivalence** of five Central and Eastern European nations as "designated states" under Canadian law, while **excluding certain provisions (Part VI)** that would otherwise impose Canadian jurisdiction over visiting military personnel.  

It serves as both a **practical tool for military cooperation** and a **symbol of Canada’s diplomatic engagement** with newly independent nations during a pivotal period in world history.

---

### **Additional Notes**  
- The designation remains in force **unless revoked by a subsequent proclamation**.  
- The exclusion of Part VI has been **retained in subsequent legal interpretations** and remains a key feature of Canada’s approach to military presence in Eastern Europe.  
- This proclamation is part of a broader body of Canadian legislation related to **military presence abroad**, including the **Military Service Act**, **Defence Act**, and **Commonwealth military agreements**.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
In May 1993, the Governor General of Canada formally designated the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine as "designated states" under the Visiting Forces Act, allowing Canadian and foreign military forces to operate under the Act’s provisions — with the exception of Part VI — to promote security cooperation and respect for national sovereignty during a period of post-Cold War transformation.
