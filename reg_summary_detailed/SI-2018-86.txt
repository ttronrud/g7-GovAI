The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2018-90"** — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered **2018/90** has been officially repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter of the regulation), a detailed summary cannot be provided, because:

1. **The regulation itself is no longer in force** — the designation "Repealed" means the instrument was formally revoked and is no longer applicable.
2. **No content is available** — since it has been repealed, the original text, provisions, or rationale for the regulation are no longer active or legally binding.
3. **SI/2018-90 lacks a clear subject** — Without knowing the full title (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2018"), it is not possible to determine whether it dealt with matters such as licensing, environmental standards, employment rules, or tax policy.

### What "Repealed, SI/2018-90" means in practice:
- The regulation was a piece of secondary legislation (a Statutory Instrument) introduced in 2018.
- It was formally repealed by a later statutory instrument or by an amendment to primary legislation.
- The repeal may have occurred to:
  - Remove outdated or redundant rules.
  - Align with updated legislation.
  - Avoid legal inconsistencies.
  - Reflect changes in policy or administrative structure.

### To obtain a detailed summary:
You would need to:
- Identify the **full title** of SI 2018/90 (e.g., *The [X] (Amendment) Regulations 2018*).
- Access the **original text** of the regulation (available via the UK legislation website: [www.legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk)).
- Review the **provisions**, **objectives**, **applicable scope**, and **key changes** it introduced.
- Then compare it with the **repealing instrument** to understand the reason for repeal.

### Example (hypothetical):
If SI 2018/90 were titled *"The Food Safety (Packaging) Regulations 2018"*, a detailed summary might include:
- Requirements for labeling of food packaging.
- Standards for material safety and allergen declaration.
- Compliance timelines and enforcement mechanisms.
- Repeal reason: superseded by more comprehensive food safety regulations in 2020.

✅ **Conclusion**:  
As of now, **SI/2018-90 is repealed**, and therefore **no detailed summary of its content can be provided** — as it is no longer in effect. To obtain a detailed summary, the full title and original text of the regulation must be identified and accessed from official legal databases.
