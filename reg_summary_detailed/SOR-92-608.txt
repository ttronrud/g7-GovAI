**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission Levies Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission Levies Order*, made under Sections 3 and 4 of the *Saskatchewan Canola Order* (Order in Council P.C. 1992-1026, dated May 14, 1992), establishes a regulatory framework for the **collection of levies** from individuals and entities involved in the **production and marketing of canola in Saskatchewan**. This Order is formally cited as **SOR/92-271**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on October 16, 1992.

The primary objective of this regulation is to **generate revenue** to support the development, promotion, and economic sustainability of the canola industry in Saskatchewan—through initiatives such as research, marketing, quality improvement, and infrastructure development.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agri-Food Act*, Statutes of Saskatchewan 1990–91, c. A-15.2. This Act provides the legal authority for the Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission to operate and enforce regulations related to canola.

- **Buyer**: A person who purchases canola for resale, direct use, or further processing.

- **Canola**: Specifically refers to canola *produced in Saskatchewan*. This ensures that only locally grown canola is subject to the levy, maintaining regional focus and economic benefit.

- **Commission**: The *Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission*, the body responsible for administering the levy system, collecting funds, and using them for canola industry development.

- **Producer**: Broadly defined and includes:
  - Any individual or entity engaged in the **production or marketing** of canola;
  - The **employer** of such a person;
  - Anyone entitled under a lease or agreement to a **share of the canola** produced by a producer;
  - Anyone entitled to the **proceeds from the sale** of that canola;
  - Anyone who **takes possession** of canola through legal proceedings (e.g., for debt recovery).

> This expansive definition ensures that even indirect stakeholders (e.g., tenants, leaseholders, or creditors) are included in the levy system, ensuring broad-based financial support for the industry.

### **Levy Structure and Application**

#### **1. Levy on Producers (Paid by the Producer)**  
- Every **producer** must pay a levy of **75 cents per metric tonne** (or portion thereof) of canola that is **marketed in interprovincial or export trade**.
- This levy applies only to canola marketed outside of Saskatchewan (i.e., not sold within the province).
- The levy is collected in accordance with the procedures outlined in **Section 4** of the Order.

> *Purpose*: To ensure that producers contribute directly to the development of the canola industry, particularly in areas such as research, quality control, and international market access.

#### **2. Levy Deducted by Buyers (Paid by the Buyer)**  
- Every **buyer** of canola must **deduct 50 cents per tonne** (or portion thereof) from any payment made to a producer.
- The deduction is applied on a **pro rata basis**, meaning it is calculated based on the proportion of canola the producer is selling.
- Buyers must deduct this levy **even if they are purchasing canola for resale or on behalf of the producer**.

> *Purpose*: To ensure that the financial burden of supporting the canola industry is shared across the supply chain. This creates a more equitable and transparent system where downstream buyers also contribute.

#### **3. Reporting and Forwarding of Levies by Buyers**  
- Every buyer who deducts the levy must:
  - **Forward the full amount of the levy** (50 cents per tonne) to the Commission;
  - Include a **completed statement** on a form provided by the Commission that contains:
    - The **amount of canola** obtained from the producer;
    - The **total levy amount** being paid on behalf of the producer;
    - The **name of the producer**;
    - The producer’s **Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) identification number**.

> *Purpose*: To ensure accurate record-keeping, accountability, and traceability of levy payments, enabling the Commission to manage funds efficiently and verify compliance.

#### **4. Payment Deadline for Levies Collected by Buyers**  
- Buyers must remit the collected levy to the Commission **within 55 days** after the end of the month in which the levy was collected.
- This deadline applies **unless otherwise directed** by the Commission (e.g., for special circumstances or adjustments).

> *Purpose*: To ensure timely and consistent revenue collection, allowing the Commission to maintain financial stability and plan long-term industry initiatives.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| **Exclusivity to Interprovincial/Export Trade** | Levies do not apply to canola sold within Saskatchewan, which helps avoid overburdening local farmers with costs not tied to external markets. |
| **Reporting Requirements** | Enhances transparency and enables the Commission to track market activity and levy collection. |
| **Inclusion of Indirect Stakeholders** | Expands the levy base to include leaseholders, tenants, and debtors, ensuring all parties with a financial interest in canola contribute. |
