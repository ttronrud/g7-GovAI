### **2. Core Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation establishes a **flexible employment framework** for temporary positions in **Statistics Canada** that are directly involved in **census and national survey operations**, particularly those related to:
- The **Population Census**
- The **Agriculture Census**
- A **national survey** replacing the long-form population census questionnaire (conducted in conjunction with the census)

The regulation addresses two key actions:
1. **Re-application** of the *Public Service Employment Act* to certain excluded positions
2. **Exclusion** of specific provisions of the PSEA from applying to certain temporary positions in Statistics Canada

---

### **3. Key Provisions Explained**

#### ✅ **Action 1: Re-application of PSEA to Excluded Positions**
- The Public Service Commission (PSC) **re-applies** the full provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* to positions that were previously excluded under the **Statistics Canada Census and Survey Related Term Employment Exclusion Approval Order (SI/2010-81)**.
- This means that **all standard employment rules** of the PSEA (e.g., promotion, transfer, internal appointments, dismissal, etc.) now apply to these positions **again**, effectively restoring them to the general public service employment framework.

> 🔍 *Note*: This re-application was made possible because the PSC determined that, in the past, excluding these positions from the PSEA was not practical or in the public interest — but now, due to changes in operational needs or policy, the rules are being reinstated.

---

#### ✅ **Action 2: Exclusion of Specific PSEA Provisions from Temporary Positions**
Despite the re-application, the regulation **excludes certain provisions of the PSEA** from applying to specific temporary positions in Statistics Canada. These exclusions are designed to allow flexibility and efficiency during census and survey operations.

##### 🔹 **Positions Covered by Exclusion**:
- Positions whose **primary function** is:
  - To provide **administrative or management support**, or  
  - To perform **data processing duties**  
- For the purpose of:
  - Conducting the **Population Census**
  - Conducting the **Agriculture Census**
  - Conducting a **national survey** under Sections 7 and 8 of the *Statistics Act* (which replaces the long-form census questionnaire and is conducted alongside the population census)

##### 🔹 **Applicable Personnel**:
- Individuals **appointed or deployed** to these positions on a **specified term basis** (i.e., temporary, fixed-term roles)

##### 🔹 **Provisions Excluded from Application**:
The following definitions and sections of the PSEA **do not apply** to these temporary positions:
- Definitions of:
  - **Deployment**
  - **Internal appointment process**
- Sections:
  - 39.1 to 41d
  - 48
  - 51 to 53e
  - 57
  - 59
  - 62

> ⚠️ *Note*: These provisions typically govern internal mobility, promotion, transfer, and appointment processes within the public service. Their exclusion allows Statistics Canada to manage temporary staff more flexibly without being bound by standard public service hiring and promotion rules.

##### 🔹 **Exception Clause**:
- The exclusion **does not apply** to individuals mentioned in **subsection 5(1) of the Statistics Act**.
- This means that certain key personnel (e.g., senior officials, chief officers, or those with specific statutory roles) remain subject to the full PSEA.

---

### **4. Policy Rationale (Why This Was Done)**

The regulation is grounded in two key policy justifications:

#### 📌 **(1) Practicality and Operational Needs**
- The Public Service Commission concluded that applying the full scope of the PSEA to temporary census and survey staff would:
  - Be **operationally impractical**
  - Hinder the ability of Statistics Canada to respond quickly and efficiently to census and survey demands
- Temporary roles require **flexibility**, especially during peak data collection periods.

#### 📌 **(2) Public Interest and Service Delivery**
- The goal is to ensure **timely, accurate, and cost-effective** data collection for national censuses and surveys.
- Excluding certain rules allows Statistics Canada to:
  - Recruit and deploy staff rapidly
  - Avoid bureaucratic delays in hiring or internal transfers
  - Maintain data integrity and operational continuity

---

### **5. Consultation Requirement**
- As required by **subsection 20(2) of the PSEA**, the Public Service Commission **consulted with the employer** (Statistics Canada) before making this decision.
- This ensures transparency, accountability, and alignment with organizational needs.

---

### **6. Timeline and Context**
- The original exclusion was established in **2010 (SI/2010-81)**.
- In **2015**, amendments (S.C. 2015, c. 5, s. 2 and s. 9) refined the scope and conditions.
- The **2017 re-application** reflects a shift in policy: while temporary roles are still excluded from certain PSEA rules, the broader employment framework is being restored to ensure accountability and compliance with public service standards.

---

### **7. Key Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Temporary Staff Flexibility** | Staff in data processing or administrative roles can be hired, deployed, and managed without going through full PSEA processes (e.g., internal appointments, promotions). |
| **Accountability** | The re-application of PSEA to excluded positions ensures that temporary staff still fall under public service employment standards, promoting fairness and transparency. |
| **Exclusion Limitations** | Exclusion only applies to **administrative/data support roles** during census/survey periods — not to core statistical or analytical roles. |
| **Statutory Exceptions** | Key personnel (as defined in subsection 5(1) of the *Statistics Act*) remain protected under full PSEA rules. |

---

### **8. Conclusion**

This regulation strikes a **balanced approach** between:
- **Operational flexibility** for Statistics Canada during critical data collection periods
- **Public service accountability** through the re-application of core employment rules

It allows Statistics Canada to:
- Respond efficiently to census and survey demands
- Maintain staffing flexibility
- Ensure that temporary roles do not disrupt the broader public service employment framework

At the same time, it preserves the integrity of public service employment standards by:
- Re-applying PSEA to excluded positions
- Excluding only specific, non-essential procedural rules from temporary roles
- Protecting key statutory personnel from such exclusions

## 📚 Summary in One Sentence:
> On July 18, 2017, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, re-applied the *Public Service Employment Act* to temporary positions in Statistics Canada previously excluded under SI/2010-81, while simultaneously excluding key employment provisions (such as deployment and internal appointment rules) from administrative and data processing roles involved in census and national survey operations — except for those individuals specifically mentioned in subsection 5(1) of the *Statistics Act* — to ensure operational flexibility without compromising public service accountability.
