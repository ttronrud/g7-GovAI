## **Scope and Application**

- These regulations apply to **all cutting and removal of timber** within a **forest area** as defined in the Forestry Act.
- They govern both **individual permit-based harvesting** and **large-scale commercial operations via agreements** with the Minister.

---

## **Permit System – Key Provisions**

### **1. Authorization Requirement**
- **No person may cut or remove timber without a permit issued by a forestry officer** under Section 7 or an agreement with the Minister under Section 14.
- **Exception**: Employees of the Department of Forestry may carry out logging duties in performance of their official duties without needing a permit.

### **2. Public Notice Requirement**
Before issuing a permit, a forestry officer must post a public notice in a prominent location that includes:
- Details of any proposed timber cutting (location, volume, species).
- Relevant information applicants must provide.
- Deadline for permit applications.
- Name and address of the forestry officer to whom applications should be submitted.

### **3. Application Process**
- Applications can be submitted **in writing or in person** to the designated forestry officer.
- The officer may issue a permit if:
  - The applicant previously harvested timber under a valid permit or agreement and **did not breach its terms**.
  - The application is submitted **within the prescribed time limit**.
  - If multiple applicants qualify, the officer selects via **random drawing of lots**.

### **4. Fee Payment**
- Applicants must pay **fees (stumpage or royalties)** to the Receiver General **before** a permit is issued.
- Fees are determined by the province where the forest area is located.
- **Cap on annual fees**: No permit holder may pay more than **$2,000 per fiscal year per forest area**.

> ⚠️ *Note: This cap applies to total fees across all permits in a single forest area per year.*

### **5. Permit Content Requirements**
Every permit must specify:
- The **exact forest area or portion** where cutting will occur.
- The **approximate amount and species** of timber allowed.
- The **method of measurement** (e.g., mill scale or licensed scaler).
- **Terms and conditions** that protect the forest area, including:
  - Encouraging **regeneration and reforestation**.
  - Preventing damage to non-permitted vegetation or habitats.
  - Avoiding harm to surrounding ecosystems and animal habitats.

> 🌳 *Environmental protection is a core principle — permits are not just about volume, but about ecological sustainability.*

### **6. Fee for Excess Harvesting**
- If a permit holder cuts **more timber than permitted**, they must pay additional fees calculated by the forestry officer based on the excess volume.

### **7. Permit Cancellation and Appeal Process**
A forestry officer may cancel a permit if:
- The permit holder **fails to follow permit conditions**.
- The holder **refuses or fails to comply** with environmental instructions (e.g., reforestation, habitat protection).
- The holder violates **municipal, provincial, or federal laws** related to forest activities.

**Cancellation Procedure**:
- The officer must **notify the permit holder in writing** of the cancellation and reasons.
- The permit holder has **21 days** to appeal the cancellation in writing to the Minister.
- The Minister must render a **decision on the appeal within 30 days**.

> 🔍 *This provides a formal review mechanism to protect permit holders from unjust cancellation.*

### **8. Non-Transferability**
- **Permits cannot be assigned or transferred** to another party.

## **Agreement System (for Large-Scale Operations)**

The Minister may enter into **agreements with operators** (individuals or entities) for large-scale timber harvesting, following a **public tender process**.

### **Key Requirements for Agreements**:
- The operator must submit a **security deposit** of **at least 10% of the tender price**.
- The deposit ensures performance and is **applied directly to the tender price**.
- The agreement must be in a form approved by the Minister and may include:
  - Payment schedule (including security deposit).
  - Forest area and timber limits (species, quantity, product).
  - Timber utilization standards (how wood will be used).
  - Measurement practices (scaling methods).
  - Environmental protection measures (e.g., erosion control, habitat preservation).
  - Silviculture plans (long-term forest regeneration).
  - Standards for construction (roads, trails, landing areas, buildings).
  - Default and termination clauses.
  - Indemnity obligations (financial responsibility for damages).

> ⚖️ *This system promotes accountability, transparency, and long-term planning in commercial forestry.*

## **Post-Harvest Obligations**

All permit holders and operators must **remove** the following from the forest area:
- All **buildings and structures**.
- All **equipment** brought into the forest.
- All **debris** (including logging slash, waste, and garbage).

### **Timeline for Removal**:
- If a period is specified in the permit or agreement, removal must occur **within that period**.
- If no period is specified, removal must occur **within 12 months** after:
  - The permit expires, or
  - Operations are completed.

### **Extension of Removal Period**
- The permit holder or operator may **request an extension of up to 12 months**.
- The request must be made **before the expiry of the original period**.
- The extension is granted **only if circumstances beyond the operator’s control** (e.g., weather, road access, flooding) prevent timely removal.

> 🛠️ *This ensures that forest areas are restored to a clean, unobstructed state after harvesting.*

## **Exemptions and Special Cases**

- **Government entities** (departments or agencies of the Government of Canada) may be issued **fee-free permits** to harvest timber on **their own lands** for **official purposes** (e.g., infrastructure, emergency response, research).
- This exemption supports national operations without requiring financial burden.

---

## **Repealed Provisions (Important Note)**

- **Section 8 (Minister’s designation)** and **Sections 10 and 11 (related to tendering and security deposits)** were **repealed** by **SOR/2017-52, s. 7 and s. 1**.
- These changes indicate **modernization or replacement** of outdated provisions, possibly due to administrative streamlining or shifts in policy.

> 🔍 *The current version of the regulations reflects a more streamlined, environmentally focused, and transparent system than earlier versions.*
