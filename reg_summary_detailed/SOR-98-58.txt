### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Regulations**

These regulations establish the rules governing the **temporary importation of goods under Tariff Item No. 9993.00.00** in Canada. This tariff item is designated for goods imported on a **temporary basis**, typically for specific purposes such as exhibitions, emergencies, testing, or training. The regulations ensure compliance with customs requirements while allowing flexibility for temporary use of goods without immediate permanent entry into the Canadian market.

The rules apply specifically to goods that are imported under **tariff item 9993.00.00**, which is categorized as a temporary importation provision under the Customs Tariff.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Carnet** | An A.T.A. (Admission Temporaire-Temporary Admission) carnet, as defined in the International Customs Convention on the A.T.A. Carnet for Temporary Admission of Goods. This document allows for the temporary importation of goods without paying customs duties. |
| **Convention** | A closed assembly of persons meeting for a common purpose (e.g., a trade show, conference, or professional gathering). |
| **Minister** | Refers to the Minister of National Revenue, who is responsible for administering these regulations. |
| **Originating Good** | A good that qualifies as "originating" under the rules of origin established by the **CUSMA**, **CCFTA**, or **CCRFTA** (Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, Canada-Central America Free Trade Agreement, Canada-Central America Regional Free Trade Agreement). |

> ⚠️ Note: The definitions for *emergency*, *exhibition*, and *accredited organization* have been **repealed** by SOR/2003-240, s.1. These terms are no longer used in the current version of the regulations.

### **3. Temporary Importation Period**

Under paragraph (f) of tariff item 9993.00.00, goods are generally subject to an **eighteen-month period** during which they must be exported or destroyed.

#### **Extension of the 18-Month Period**

If it becomes **impracticable or impossible** to export the goods within the initial 18 months, the period is extended under the following conditions:

- To the day **30 days after** the day it becomes **practicable or possible** to export the goods; **or**
- To the day that occurs **30 months after** the expiry of the original 18-month period  
> The extension applies only to the **earlier** of these two dates.

This provision provides practical relief for importers facing unforeseen logistical, financial, or operational challenges in exporting the goods.

---

### **4. When Can Goods Be Consumed or Expended?**

Goods may be considered **consumed or expended** (i.e., legally permitted to be used up) under one of the following circumstances:

1. **In the course of responding to an emergency**  
   (e.g., natural disasters, public health crises)

2. **During testing or examination of the goods for certification**  
   by an **accredited organization** (e.g., a recognized testing lab or certification body)

3. **In the course of an emergency response training exercise**  
   (e.g., fire drills, medical response training)

> These are the only circumstances under which consumption or expenditure is legally recognized and exempt from requiring export or destruction.

---

### **5. Security Requirements for Importers**

If goods are imported under tariff item 9993.00.00 **without a valid A.T.A. carnet**, the importer must provide **security** to ensure compliance with the temporary importation rules.

#### **Security Must Cover Two Outcomes:**

1. **Exportation or Destruction** of the goods within the 18-month period (or any extension under section 3); **or**  
2. **Payment of applicable customs duties** that would have been due if the goods had been permanently imported and classified under their correct tariff item.

> The amount of security is determined by the Minister based on the conditions specified in tariff item 9993.00.00.

#### **Exemptions from Security Requirements**

The following situations **do not require** the importer to provide security:

- **Originating goods** (i.e., goods that qualify as originating under CUSMA, CCFTA, or CCRFTA rules of origin)
- Goods intended for **display or demonstration** at a **convention or exhibition** held in Canada by any level of government, whether in Canada or abroad
- Goods where the **customs duties are $100 or less**
- There is **evidence that the goods will be exported**
- **Commercial samples and advertising films** imported from the **United States, Mexico, Chile, or Costa Rica**

> ⚠️ Note: The exemption for commercial samples and advertising films from the U.S., Mexico, Chile, and Costa Rica is specific and limited to these countries and types of goods.

---

### **6. Refund or Cancellation of Security**

Security provided under subsection 5(1) may be **refunded or cancelled** in the following cases:

1. **Re-determination of tariff classification**  
   – If the goods undergo a re-determination of their tariff classification under the Customs Act  
   – And the **duties applicable to the re-determined classification have been paid**

2. **Before expiration of the 18-month period (or extension)**  
   – If the goods have been:
     - **Exported**
     - **Destroyed**, and the destruction has been **certified** by:
       - A customs officer, or
       - Another person designated by the Minister under tariff item 9993.00.00

3. **Consumed or expended** in one of the circumstances listed in **Section 4** (emergency, testing, training)

> This ensures that importers are not penalized unnecessarily if they comply with the rules and either export, destroy, or legally use the goods.

---

### **7. Repeal and Amendments**

- The definitions of **"emergency"**, **"exhibition"**, and **"accredited organization"** have been **repealed** by **SOR/2003-240, s.1**. These terms are no longer in force.
- The requirement for security on certain goods has been **revised or removed** by **SOR/2024-41, s.68**, which **fully repeals** the security requirement in specific instances.  
  > This means that the exemption for **originating goods**, **exhibitions**, **low-duty goods**, and **commercial samples** from the U.S., Mexico, Chile, and Costa Rica remains in effect, but the security provisions are now more clearly defined and simplified.

### **8. Effective Date**
