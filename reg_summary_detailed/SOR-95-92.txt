**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act*, specifically **paragraph 29(1)(a)**. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) to authorize certain government employees to acquire an interest in territorial lands within the Northwest Territories.

This Order is formally titled:  
**"Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1995, No. 1."**

---

**2. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **authorize a specific employee of the Government of Canada** to acquire a legal interest in a parcel of land located in the Northwest Territories. This authorization is granted under the provisions of the Territorial Lands Act, which permits government employees to obtain land interests for specific purposes, such as work-related or operational needs.

**3. Authorized Employee and Land Description:**

The employee authorized under this Order is:  
**Charles Roger Bourque**,  
- Residence: Town of Fort Smith, Northwest Territories  
- Occupation: Craftsman  
- Departmental affiliation: Department of Canadian Heritage  

**Land Description:**  
The employee is authorized to **lease for commercial purposes** the entire parcel of land situated:  
- On the **easterly shore of Alcantara Lake**  
- Within **Quad 75 C/16** of the Northwest Territories  

The exact location of the parcel is specified as being **outlined in red** on a sketch plan titled **"file 33-1-12"**, which is held in the **Land Management Division** of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (now part of the Department of Indigenous Services Canada or a related federal department).

**4. Key Provisions and Exclusions:**

- **Commercial Use Only:** The lease is designated for **commercial purposes**, indicating that the activity will involve business operations, likely related to crafts, manufacturing, or other commercial enterprises, given Bourque’s occupation as a craftsman.

- **Exclusions and Reservations:**  
  The Order explicitly **saves and reserves** from the lease the following rights and interests:  
  - All **mines and minerals**, including **hydrocarbons** (such as oil, gas, or natural gas)  
  - Both **solid, liquid, and gaseous** forms of minerals  
  - The **right to work** such mineral resources  

  This means that while the employee may use the land for commercial purposes, the government retains all rights to explore, extract, or develop mineral resources on the parcel.

---

**5. Legal and Administrative Significance:**

- This Order is a **federal land use authorization** under the Territorial Lands Act, which governs land tenure and use in the Northwest Territories.  
- It reflects a mechanism by which the federal government can facilitate the use of land by its employees for operational or commercial activities, while maintaining control over valuable natural resources.  
- The reservation of mineral rights ensures that the federal government retains regulatory and economic control over potential resource development on the land, even if it is leased for commercial use.

---

**6. Practical Implications:**

- Charles Roger Bourque can now **enter into a lease agreement** with a third party (or operate commercially) on the specified parcel, provided the lease complies with all applicable laws and regulations.  
- The lease must be structured to **exclude any rights to extract or develop minerals**, as those rights are reserved by the government.  
- The lease may be subject to review or approval by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development or a relevant land management authority.

---

**7. Context and Background:**

- The 1995 date reflects a period when federal government departments were increasingly utilizing land acquisition mechanisms to support employee-based economic development or cultural initiatives.  
- The inclusion of a craftsman in such a lease may indicate a government effort to support **indigenous or local cultural industries** or to promote **economic development in rural or remote communities** like Fort Smith.  
- The reservation of mineral rights underscores the federal government’s role in managing natural resources in northern territories, particularly in the context of resource exploration and development.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation authorizes **Charles Roger Bourque**, an employee of the Department of Canadian Heritage, to lease a parcel of land on the eastern shore of Alcantara Lake in the Northwest Territories for **commercial purposes**. The lease is strictly limited to non-mineral activities, with all rights to **mines, minerals, and hydrocarbons** being **reserved by the Government of Canada**. The Order is a formal, legally binding instrument issued under the Territorial Lands Act and serves as a tool for enabling federal employees to engage in commercial land use while preserving government control over natural resources.
