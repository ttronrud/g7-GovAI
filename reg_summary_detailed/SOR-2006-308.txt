**Detailed Summary of the Going-Private Transaction (Insurance Companies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**

The regulations are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act):

- **Subsection 2(1)** of the Act: Defines the term *going-private transaction*.
- **Subsection 1021(1)b** of the Act: Provides the legal basis for regulating such transactions in the context of insurance companies and insurance holding companies.

These regulations are formally enacted under:
- **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 214(2)** and **s. 364** (Statutes of Canada, 2005, Chapter 54)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 47** (Reference to prior legislative framework)

This means the regulations are a statutory instrument designed to implement and clarify the definition of a "going-private transaction" as defined in the *Insurance Companies Act*, with a focus on protecting the interests of participating security holders.

### **2. Key Definition: What Constitutes a "Going-Private Transaction"?**

A **going-private transaction** is defined as:

> *"An amalgamation or other transaction involving a distributing company or a distributing insurance holding company, other than an acquisition of shares under section 308 of the Act, that results in the interest of a holder of participating securities of the company or insurance holding company being terminated without the consent of the holder and without the substitution of an interest of equivalent value in participating securities of the company or the insurance holding company or of another company or another insurance holding company that succeeds to the business of the company or the insurance holding company, which participating securities have rights and privileges that are equal to or greater than the affected participating securities."*

#### **Breakdown of the Definition:**

- **Applicable Entities**: The transaction must involve:
  - A **distributing company** (a company that distributes insurance products or services), or
  - A **distributing insurance holding company** (a holding company that owns or controls insurance companies and distributes their products).

- **Exclusion**: The definition **excludes** transactions that are **acquisitions of shares under Section 308 of the Act**. This ensures that ordinary share purchases or transfers are not captured under this regulatory definition.

- **Core Requirement**: The transaction must result in:
  - The **termination of a holder’s interest** in **participating securities**.
  - This termination must occur **without the consent** of the security holder.
  - **No substitution** of an equivalent interest in:
    - Participating securities of the same company or holding company, or
    - Participating securities of another company or insurance holding company that **succeeds to the business** of the original company.

- **Value and Rights Requirement**: The participating securities involved must have **rights and privileges that are equal to or greater than** those of the affected securities. This ensures that the transaction does not disproportionately disadvantage holders of participating securities.

> In simpler terms: A "going-private transaction" occurs when a company or holding company restructures or merges in a way that removes a participating security holder’s rights (e.g., right to share in profits or assets) without their consent, and without replacing those rights with equivalent ones in a successor entity.

### **3. Definition of "Participating Securities"**

These are securities that provide holders with:

- A **right to share in the earnings** (profits) of the company or insurance holding company.
- A **right to share in the assets** of the company or holding company **after liquidation, dissolution, or winding up**.

> These are distinct from ordinary shares. Participating securities typically offer enhanced benefits, such as profit-sharing or dividend participation, and are often associated with long-term, stable insurance company structures.

The inclusion of such securities in the definition emphasizes the protection of policyholders and investors who rely on these benefits, especially in the context of insurance companies where long-term stability and profit-sharing are key.

### **4. Purpose and Regulatory Objective**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Protect the rights of participating security holders** during corporate restructuring or amalgamations.
- Prevent situations where such holders are **unfairly deprived** of their benefits (e.g., profit-sharing rights) without consent or adequate compensation.
- Ensure that any transaction that results in the termination of participating interests is **transparent, fair, and compliant** with the principles of equity and investor protection.
- Maintain public confidence in the stability and integrity of the insurance sector.

By requiring that equivalent interests be substituted in the event of a going-private transaction, the regulations promote **fairness and transparency** in corporate restructurings.

### **5. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*. This ensures that the rules are immediately enforceable upon formal publication and legal recognition.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Going-Private Transaction (Insurance Companies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* serve as a critical mechanism within the *Insurance Companies Act* to safeguard the interests of participating security holders during corporate restructuring. By clearly defining what constitutes a "going-private transaction" and setting strict conditions on the termination of participating rights, the regulations ensure that such transactions do not undermine the financial security or long-term benefits of investors and policyholders. The rules are narrowly focused—excluding share acquisitions under Section 308—and are designed to preserve the rights of those who hold securities with enhanced profit-sharing and asset-sharing privileges.

These regulations reflect a commitment to **transparency, fairness, and investor protection** in the Canadian insurance industry.
