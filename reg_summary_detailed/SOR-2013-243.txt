**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Grain Order (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2; R.S., c. A-6)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Origin**
The Ontario Grain Order was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, under **Section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. This legislative authority enables the government to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, specifically grain, in Ontario.

This Order is a regulatory instrument designed to govern the **marketing of grain in interprovincial and export trade** within the province, and it establishes specific powers and responsibilities for two key bodies:  
- The **Commodity Board** (Grain Farmers of Ontario)  
- The **Supervisory Board** (Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission)

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Commodity Board** | Refers to the **Grain Farmers of Ontario**. It is responsible for managing and regulating grain marketing, particularly in interprovincial and export markets. |
| **Grain** | Defined broadly as **any combination of grain corn, soybeans, and any variety of wheat** produced in Ontario. This includes all common staple grains grown in the province. |
| **Grain Corn** | Specifically refers to **corn that is not seed corn, sweet corn, or popping corn**. This excludes specialty or seed varieties, focusing on commodity-grade corn used in food, feed, or industrial applications. |
| **Supervisory Board** | Refers to the **Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission**. It oversees and monitors the grain marketing system to ensure fair practices, transparency, and equitable outcomes. |

### **3. Powers Granted to the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board**

The Order grants both the Commodity Board and the Supervisory Board **broad regulatory powers** over the marketing of grain in **interprovincial and export trade**, including the ability to exercise powers similar to those they hold in **local marketing within Ontario**.

These powers include:

#### **A. Levies and Charges**
- The Boards are authorized to:
  - **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals and entities engaged in **grain production or marketing** within Ontario.
- They may **classify producers or marketers into different groups** (e.g., based on size, type of operation, or volume of production).
- Each group can be assigned **different levies or charges**, allowing for a tiered, equitable system that reflects the scale or nature of participation.

#### **B. Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:
- **Creation of reserves** (to provide financial buffers during market downturns or price volatility)
- **Payment of operating expenses** associated with grain marketing activities
- **Reimbursement of losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of grain (e.g., price drops, spoilage, or market fluctuations)
- **Equalization or adjustment of financial outcomes** among grain producers

> This equalization mechanism is particularly significant — it allows the Boards to **distribute or transfer funds** to producers who may have suffered losses due to market conditions, thereby promoting **fairness and economic stability** across the grain sector.

---

### **4. Scope and Application**
- The powers apply to **persons and property located within Ontario**.
- The regulations specifically cover **interprovincial trade** (sales to other provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside of Canada), ensuring that grain producers and marketers are governed consistently regardless of the destination of their grain.
- The Boards can apply these powers in a manner consistent with their local marketing authority, ensuring continuity and coherence in policy implementation.

---

### **5. Effective Date**
The Ontario Grain Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the Ontario Gazette. This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication, allowing stakeholders to adjust their operations accordingly.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Market Stability** | By establishing levies and reserves, the Order helps stabilize grain markets during periods of price volatility. |
| **Equity Among Producers** | The equalization mechanism ensures that smaller or less profitable producers are not disproportionately harmed by market fluctuations. |
| **Regulatory Oversight** | The involvement of both the Grain Farmers of Ontario (representing producers) and the Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission (an independent oversight body) ensures a balance between producer interests and market integrity. |
| **Financial Sustainability** | The ability to generate and manage levies supports the long-term financial health of the grain marketing system. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The Ontario Grain Order is a critical regulatory framework that empowers the **Grain Farmers of Ontario** and the **Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission** to manage the interprovincial and export marketing of grain in Ontario. By enabling the imposition of tiered levies, the creation of financial reserves, and the equalization of producer incomes, the Order promotes **economic fairness, market stability, and long-term sustainability** in the province’s grain industry.

It reflects a balanced approach that protects producer interests while ensuring the efficient and equitable functioning of grain trade across Canada and internationally.
