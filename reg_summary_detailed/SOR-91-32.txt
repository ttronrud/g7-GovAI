**Detailed Summary of the Mail and Courier Imports (GST/HST) Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Context and Authority**  
The *Mail and Courier Imports (GST/HST) Regulations* were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under subsection 277(1) of the *Excise Tax Act* (Act). These regulations came into force on November 26, 1997, and are part of Canada’s framework for collecting Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) on imported goods delivered via mail or courier services.

The regulations are formally cited as the *Mail and Courier Imports (GST/HST) Regulations* and are designed to ensure that certain imported goods—particularly those received through postal or courier channels—are subject to GST/HST at the point of importation, even when the goods are not physically delivered to a retail store.

---

**Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a clear definition of which imported goods are considered "prescribed goods" for the purposes of section 7 of Schedule VII of the *Excise Tax Act*. This ensures that the tax collection system applies consistently to goods imported by mail or courier, preventing tax evasion and ensuring equitable taxation across all forms of cross-border trade.

**Key Definitions and Scope**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*, which governs the taxation of excisable goods and other taxable items in Canada.

2. **"Prescribed Goods" (under section 7 of Schedule VII of the Act)**  
   The regulations define specific categories of imported goods that are subject to GST/HST when imported by mail or courier. These include:

   - **Excisable goods and wine**  
     Goods that are subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, fuel) are included. These are taxed regardless of the method of delivery.

   - **Goods that are prescribed property under section 143.1 of the Act**  
     This category applies to goods that are considered "prescribed property" under section 143.1 (typically goods with specific tax implications, such as certain high-value or luxury items). However, only those goods supplied by a seller who is *required to register* under Subdivision d of Division V of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act but is *not actually registered* are included.  
     *Rationale*: This provision targets unregistered suppliers who may be selling taxable goods through mail or courier, ensuring that such sales are taxed properly.

   - **Goods for which the value for duty is reduced under section 85 of the Customs Tariff**  
     These are goods that qualify for a reduced duty rate under the Customs Tariff (e.g., certain consumer goods or items with specific trade agreements). Even though duty may be reduced, these goods are still subject to GST/HST under the regulations when imported by mail or courier.

   - **Goods purchased from a retailer in Canada and mailed or transported directly from outside Canada to the purchaser**  
     This covers the scenario where a Canadian resident buys goods from a Canadian retailer, and the goods are shipped directly from abroad (e.g., a Canadian customer orders a product online from a foreign supplier, and the retailer ships it directly). The goods are considered imported and thus subject to GST/HST.

   - **Goods purchased or ordered through or from a person in Canada acting on behalf of a person outside Canada**  
     This includes cases where a Canadian-based intermediary (e.g., an online seller, e-commerce platform, or agent) sells goods to a Canadian buyer on behalf of a foreign seller. The goods are considered imported into Canada and are subject to GST/HST.

---

**Effective Date**  
Subsection 2(1) of the regulations specifies that the rules apply to goods imported **after November 26, 1997**. This means that prior to this date, goods imported by mail or courier were not subject to the same GST/HST rules under this regulation.

**Key Implications and Practical Effects**

- **Tax Compliance for E-Commerce and International Shipping**  
  The regulations provide a legal basis for taxing goods delivered to Canadian consumers via international mail or courier services, especially in the growing e-commerce sector.

- **Prevention of Tax Evasion**  
  By defining which goods are taxable, the regulations help prevent tax avoidance through the use of mail or courier services to bypass traditional retail sales tax systems.

- **Clarity for Businesses and Consumers**  
  The clear categorization of taxable goods helps businesses understand their tax obligations when selling or distributing goods across borders and informs consumers about potential tax liabilities on imported items.

- **Alignment with Customs and Excise Framework**  
  The rules are consistent with broader customs and excise tax frameworks, particularly section 85 of the Customs Tariff and section 143.1 of the Excise Tax Act, ensuring coherence between duty and tax regimes.

**Conclusion**  
The *Mail and Courier Imports (GST/HST) Regulations* establish a comprehensive and targeted framework for applying GST/HST to specific types of imported goods delivered by mail or courier. By identifying which goods are subject to taxation—particularly excisable items, goods from unregistered suppliers, and those shipped directly from abroad—the regulations ensure fair and consistent tax collection in Canada’s evolving international trade environment. The rules are particularly relevant in the context of online retail and cross-border e-commerce, where goods are often delivered directly to consumers without passing through traditional retail channels.

These regulations remain a foundational component of Canada’s tax administration for imported goods and continue to be relevant in the modern digital economy.
