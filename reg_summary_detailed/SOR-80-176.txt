#### **1. Regulatory Context and Authority**
- These regulations were issued by the **Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** under **Section 3 of the Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order**.
- The regulations are enacted pursuant to the **Farm Products Marketing Act (Ontario)**, which provides the legal framework for regulating the marketing of farm products, including asparagus.
- The regulations came into effect on **March 7, 1980**, and are officially cited as the **Ontario Asparagus Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations** (SOR/78-859, 1978 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 4217).

#### **2. Scope and Applicability**

- **Exclusions**:
  - Producers whose land is **less than one-half acre**.

### **Conclusion**

The **Ontario Asparagus Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations, 1980**, establish a comprehensive, regulated system for the marketing of processed asparagus in Ontario. By centralizing control through the Commodity Board, enforcing strict rules on transport, grading, and payment, and ensuring equitable profit distribution, the regulations aim to:

- Protect producers from market volatility,
- Ensure consistent product quality,
- Facilitate efficient interprovincial and export trade,
- Promote fair competition and transparency.

While the regulations reflect a specific historical context (early 1980s agricultural marketing), their core principles—centralized marketing, quality standards, and equitable revenue sharing—remain relevant to modern agricultural commodity boards in Ontario and beyond.
