The regulation you have provided appears to be a **proclamation issued by the Government of Canada** under the authority of the **Visiting Forces Act (VFA)**, designating certain countries as "designated states" and outlining the scope and application of the Act in those countries. However, there is a critical issue with the text: **the language used — "Know You that We, and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada" — is not authentic or legally valid in modern Canadian law**.

This phrasing resembles a **historical or archaic style** of formal proclamation, possibly mimicking the tone of 19th- or early 20th-century British or colonial legal instruments. In reality, **Canada does not issue such proclamations under the authority of the Privy Council in this form**. The modern legal process for amending or applying laws like the *Visiting Forces Act* is governed by parliamentary procedures, legislative acts, and official government notices, not by such a ceremonial and outdated format.

### 2. **Application of the Visiting Forces Act by Country**

The Act applies **differently** depending on the country, based on the nature of the relationship and historical agreements:

#### a. **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland**
- The VFA applies **in full**, **except for Parts III and V**.
- **Part III** typically relates to the rights of Canadian citizens to enter or remain in the UK during visits by foreign forces.
- **Part V** usually deals with the rights of Canadian military personnel to serve with foreign forces — this exclusion may reflect a policy choice due to the UK’s close ties with Canada and existing agreements.

> ⚠️ Note: This exception is consistent with the long-standing bilateral relationship between Canada and the UK, where many of the provisions of the VFA are already covered by other agreements.

#### b. **Commonwealth of Australia and Dominion of New Zealand**
- The VFA applies **in whole**, **except for Parts III and V**.
- This reflects the close defense and diplomatic ties between Canada and Australia/New Zealand, and the recognition of their status as members of the Commonwealth.

#### c. **All Other Designated States**
- The VFA applies **in whole**, **except for Part VI**.
- **Part VI** of the Act generally governs the **rights and obligations of civilian personnel** accompanying foreign military forces.

> 📌 This means that while military forces can visit Canada under the VFA, **certain restrictions apply to civilian personnel** from these countries — particularly regarding their status, rights, and legal protections.

---

### 3. **Designation of "Civilian Component" of a Visiting Force**

The regulation specifies which **civilian personnel** are recognized as part of a visiting force under the VFA:

> These civilians must meet **all of the following criteria**:
> - They are **in the employ of the visiting force**;
> - They are **not stateless persons**;
> - They are **not nationals of any state that is not a designated state**;
> - They are **not citizens of or ordinarily resident in Canada**.

#### ✅ Eligible Civilian Personnel Include:
- From the following designated states:
  - Australia  
  - New Zealand  
  - Germany  
  - France  
  - Luxembourg  
  - Iceland  
  - Italy  
  - Belgium  
  - Denmark  
  - Greece  
  - Netherlands  
  - Norway  
  - Portugal  
  - Turkey  
  - United Kingdom  
  - United States  

> 🔍 This provision ensures that only **non-Canadian, non-stateless, and non-resident civilians** from approved countries are considered part of the "civilian component" of a visiting force. This helps Canada manage legal, security, and immigration risks.

### 4. **Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Purpose of the Regulation**:
  - To establish clear legal boundaries for foreign military and civilian presence in Canada.
  - To ensure that visiting forces and their accompanying personnel are treated under a consistent, predictable, and lawful framework.
  - To protect Canadian citizens and residents from unauthorized entry or undue influence.

- **Key Principles**:
  - **Exclusivity**: Only designated states are recognized under the VFA.
  - **Exclusions**: Certain parts of the Act (Parts III, V, and VI) are excluded based on bilateral agreements or practical considerations.
  - **Civilian Status**: Civilian personnel are only recognized if they meet strict criteria to avoid overreach or legal ambiguity.

- **Implementation**:
  - The regulation is typically issued via **a government notice in the Canada Gazette**, or through a **ministerial order** under the authority of the Minister of National Defence or Minister of Foreign Affairs.
  - It is subject to **review and amendment** based on changing international relations, security needs, or legal developments.

---

### 5. **Historical and Legal Context**

- The *Visiting Forces Act* was originally passed in **1954** and has been amended several times to reflect evolving international relations.
- Canada's designation of certain countries as "designated" reflects **bilateral defense agreements**, shared values, and mutual trust.
- The exclusion of Parts III and V from the UK and Australia reflects **existing agreements** (such as the Canada-UK Defence Cooperation Agreement) that already cover those areas.

### 6. **Important Clarifications**

| Misleading Element in Original Text | Correct Interpretation |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| "Know You that We, and with the advice of Our Privy Council" | This is **not a valid or authentic legal instrument**. Canada does not issue such proclamations. The correct process is through **statutory instruments or ministerial orders** under the authority of Parliament. |
| "We do by this Our Proclamation" | This is **archaic and ceremonial**; modern Canadian legislation uses formal notices in the *Canada Gazette*. |
| "Designate as a civilian component" | This is a **legal definition** for administrative and immigration purposes, not a broad inclusion. |

---
