### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation grants a **remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness)** of anti-dumping duties that were previously imposed on specific imports of **vitreous type I cold-rolled steel** produced via the **open coil anneal process**. The remission applies to the period from **June 1, 1997, to October 31, 1997**.

---

### **Scope of the Remission**  
- **Product Type:** Vitreous type I cold-rolled steel  
- **Production Process:** Manufactured using the **open coil anneal process**  
- **Time Period Covered:** June 1, 1997 – October 31, 1997  

This remission applies to **anti-dumping duties** that were assessed and collected under the *Special Import Measures Act* during the specified period.

### **Conditions for Remission**  
To be eligible for the remission, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Timely Claim Submission:**  
   An importer must **submit a claim for remission to the Minister of National Revenue within two years** of the date this Order comes into force.  
   - Since the Order came into force on **February 26, 1998**, the deadline for claiming remission was **February 26, 2000**.

2. **Evidence Requirement:**  
   The importer must provide **sufficient evidence** to the Minister of National Revenue demonstrating that:  
   - The steel imported is indeed **vitreous type I cold-rolled steel**, and  
   - It was produced using the **open coil anneal process**.  
   - The evidence required may include documentation such as certificates of origin, technical specifications, production process details, or other relevant data as determined by the Minister.

---

### **Legal Basis**  
- The Order is authorized under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**, which allows for the remission of duties in certain circumstances, particularly when there is a justified economic or administrative reason (e.g., correcting errors, addressing market distortions, or ensuring fair trade practices).  
- The *Special Import Measures Act* provides the framework for the imposition of anti-dumping duties, and this Order serves to adjust or relieve those duties for a specific period and product.

---

### **Key Implications**  
- Importers who had paid anti-dumping duties on vitreous type I cold-rolled steel from the open coil anneal process during the 1997 period may be eligible to **recover those duties** if they meet the conditions.  
- The remission is not automatic — it requires **active application** and **verification of product details**.  
- The regulation reflects a policy of **trade adjustment and fairness**, possibly in response to market conditions, industry concerns, or administrative review of the original anti-dumping determination.

---

### **Important Notes**  
- The remission applies **only to the specified time frame** (June 1 – October 31, 1997).  
- The regulation does **not extend to other types of steel** or other production processes.  
- The requirement for evidence ensures that the remission is not misapplied and that only qualifying imports are eligible.  
- The two-year deadline is strict and must be observed to maintain eligibility.

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a targeted relief measure designed to correct or reduce the financial burden on importers of a specific type of steel during a defined period. It balances the need to enforce fair trade practices (via anti-dumping duties) with the need to provide relief in specific, well-defined circumstances. The conditions for eligibility—timely claim submission and verifiable product details—ensure accountability and prevent misuse of the remission.
