**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Cranberry Order (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2; R.S., c. A-6)**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, known as the *British Columbia Cranberry Order*, is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* and specifically enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. It establishes the regulatory framework governing the marketing of cranberries in British Columbia (BC), particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

The Order comes into force upon registration and provides the legal foundation for the British Columbia Cranberry Marketing Commission (the "Commission") to regulate the marketing of cranberries in ways that mirror its existing authority over local marketing, while extending those powers to broader trade channels.

### **Key Legal Authority**

- **Primary Basis**: Section 2(a) of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*.
- **Applicable Legislation**: 
  - The *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act* (RSBC 1996, c. 330), which provides the overarching legal framework for marketing regulation in BC.
  - The *British Columbia Cranberry Marketing Scheme, 1968* (the "Plan"), which serves as the foundational marketing framework for cranberry operations in the province.

### **Core Powers and Functions of the Commission**

The Commission is granted broad regulatory authority to manage the marketing of cranberries in both domestic (interprovincial) and international (export) markets. This authority is explicitly extended to persons and properties located within British Columbia, enabling the Commission to exercise powers similar to those it holds for local marketing under the Act and the Plan.

#### 1. **Regulation of Marketing Activities**
- The Commission may regulate all aspects of cranberry marketing in interprovincial and export trade.
- This includes setting rules for pricing, volume, quality standards, and market access, ensuring fair and stable market conditions for producers.

#### 2. **Imposition and Collection of Levies and Charges**
- The Commission has the power to:
  - **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities involved in the production or marketing of cranberries (or any part thereof).
- These levies may be applied differently depending on the type of participant (e.g., growers, processors, exporters).
- The Commission may **classify persons into different groups** (e.g., small producers vs. large processors) and establish **differential levies** based on group characteristics.

#### 3. **Use of Levies and Charges**
Funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a variety of purposes, including:
- **Creation of reserves** to provide financial stability during periods of market downturns or low prices.
- **Payment of operational expenses** and administrative costs associated with marketing and management.
- **Reimbursement for losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of cranberries (e.g., unsold inventory, price collapses).
- **Equalization or adjustment of revenues** among producers to ensure fair distribution of income from cranberry sales over time. This helps mitigate economic disparities between producers and supports market stability.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of this Order are:
- To ensure a stable and equitable market for cranberries in BC.
- To protect producers from market volatility, especially in interprovincial and export markets where prices can fluctuate significantly.
- To promote fair competition and prevent exploitation by large buyers or intermediaries.
- To maintain the long-term viability of the cranberry industry by providing financial safeguards and shared resources.

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the day it is officially registered in the *Statutes of British Columbia*. This date is typically published in the *BC Government Gazette* and serves as the legal start date for all provisions.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Economic Stability**: By allowing the Commission to create reserves and adjust revenues, the Order helps buffer producers against price volatility.
- **Equity Among Producers**: The equalization mechanism ensures that even small or less competitive producers benefit from market outcomes, reducing economic disparities.
- **Market Integrity**: The regulatory powers support transparency, fairness, and accountability in the marketing chain.
- **Continuity with Historical Framework**: The Order builds upon the 1968 Marketing Scheme, preserving institutional continuity while adapting to modern market conditions.

### **Conclusion**

The *British Columbia Cranberry Order* is a critical piece of agricultural regulation that empowers the Cranberry Marketing Commission to manage the marketing of cranberries in interprovincial and export markets effectively. By enabling the imposition of targeted levies, the use of collected funds for financial stability, and equitable revenue distribution, the Order supports a resilient, fair, and sustainable cranberry industry in British Columbia. It reflects a balanced approach to market regulation—protecting producer interests while maintaining market efficiency and transparency.
