**Detailed Summary of the Inter-American Development Bank Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Inter-American Development Bank Privileges and Immunities Order* and may be cited as such. This Order establishes the legal framework governing the privileges and immunities of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and its associated personnel when operating within Canada.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines two central terms:  

- **"Convention"**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1946. This international treaty provides a legal basis for the operational independence and protection of UN bodies, officials, and representatives.  
- **"Organization"**: Refers to the *Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)*, a multilateral financial institution established to promote economic and social development in the Americas.

**3. Legal Capacity of the Organization in Canada**  
The IADB is granted, in Canada, the **legal capacity of a body corporate**. This means that the Bank is recognized as a legally distinct entity with the rights and responsibilities of a corporation under Canadian law—such as the ability to own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and conduct business independently.  

This legal status enables the IADB to function effectively within Canada as a formal institution, including in matters of governance, financial operations, and contractual obligations.

**4. Privileges and Immunities of the Organization**  
To the extent necessary for the performance of its functions, the IADB shall have the **privileges and immunities** set out in **Articles II and III of the UN Convention**. These provisions typically include:  

- **Immunity from jurisdiction** (i.e., the inability of Canadian courts to issue warrants or enforce civil or criminal proceedings against the Bank itself or its property);  
- **Immunity from taxation** (such as income or property taxes);  
- **Freedom from interference in its administrative and financial operations**;  
- **Immunity of its property and assets** (including buildings, equipment, and funds);  
- **Freedom from search or seizure** of its premises or documents.  

These privileges ensure that the IADB can operate without undue interference from Canadian authorities, allowing it to fulfill its mandate of development financing and policy coordination across the Americas.

**5. Privileges and Immunities of State Representatives**  
Representatives of **member states** of the IADB (i.e., government officials or delegates sent by national governments to participate in IADB activities) shall have in Canada the privileges and immunities provided under **Article IV of the UN Convention**. These include:  

- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., civil or criminal proceedings) in Canada for acts performed in the course of their official duties;  
- **Immunity from taxation**;  
- **Protection of personal property and communications**;  
- **Freedom to travel and conduct official business** without interference.  

These protections ensure that diplomatic and governmental representatives can carry out their duties without fear of legal action or obstruction in Canada.

**6. Privileges and Immunities of Officials of the Organization**  
Officials of the IADB (such as senior staff, managers, or administrative personnel) shall have in Canada the privileges and immunities set forth in **Article V of the UN Convention**, which applies to officials of the United Nations. These include:  

- **Immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction** in Canada for acts performed in the course of their official duties;  
- **Immunity from search or seizure** of personal effects or official documents;  
- **Immunity from taxation** on income derived from official duties;  
- **Protection of personal and official communications**.  

This ensures that IADB employees can perform their duties professionally and independently, without fear of prosecution or legal action in Canada.

**7. Privileges and Immunities of Experts on Mission**  
Experts (such as consultants, technical advisors, or researchers) who are temporarily assigned to perform missions for the IADB shall have in Canada the privileges and immunities outlined in **Article VI of the UN Convention**, which applies to experts on missions for the United Nations. These include:  

- **Immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction** for acts performed in the course of their expert duties;  
- **Immunity from taxation** on income earned from the mission;  
- **Protection of personal and professional communications**;  
- **Freedom to travel and work without interference**.  

This allows experts to conduct their work objectively and without fear of legal consequences in Canada, which is essential for technical and advisory functions.

---

**8. Limitations and Conditions**  
All privileges and immunities are granted **"to such extent as may be required for the performance of their functions"**. This means:  

- The privileges are **not absolute** and are strictly limited to the scope necessary for the specific duties of the individuals or entity;  
- The IADB and its representatives must still comply with Canadian laws and regulations;  
- Any breach of Canadian law (e.g., fraud, corruption, or criminal conduct) may result in the loss of immunity;  
- The immunity does **not extend to personal misconduct** unrelated to official duties.

---

**9. Purpose and Policy Rationale**  
The Order serves several key purposes:  

- To enable the IADB to operate efficiently and independently in Canada;  
- To facilitate international cooperation and development projects by protecting the legal and operational integrity of the Bank and its personnel;  
- To align Canada’s treatment of the IADB with international standards, ensuring consistency with the UN Convention and multilateral norms;  
- To support Canada’s role as a host country for international institutions by providing a clear, predictable, and legally grounded framework for diplomatic and institutional operations.

**Conclusion**  
The *Inter-American Development Bank Privileges and Immunities Order* provides a comprehensive legal basis for the IADB’s operations in Canada. It grants the Bank corporate status and extends to it, as well as to its representatives, officials, and experts, a range of privileges and immunities derived from the UN Convention. These protections are essential for enabling effective international development cooperation, ensuring operational autonomy, and upholding the principles of diplomatic and institutional neutrality. However, such privileges are conditional and strictly limited to official duties, preserving Canadian legal sovereignty and accountability.  

This Order reflects Canada’s commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism in the context of development finance and regional integration.
