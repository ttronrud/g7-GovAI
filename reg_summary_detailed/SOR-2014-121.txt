**Key Provisions and Summary:**

1. **Purpose of the Regulation:**  
   This regulation formally and legally terminates (i.e., "expires") Section 12.2 of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006 Regulations*. It serves as an administrative instrument to update the regulatory framework by removing a specific provision that was previously in effect.

2. **Section 12.2 in Question:**  
   Section 12.2 of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006 Regulations* was a regulatory provision related to the export charge regime for softwood lumber products. While the exact content of Section 12.2 is not provided in the text, its expiration indicates that it governed a specific aspect—such as eligibility criteria, calculation methods, exemptions, or reporting requirements—related to the export charge system. The removal of this section suggests a change in policy or the completion of a transitional phase in the implementation of the export charge regime.

3. **Effective Expiry Date:**  
   Section 12.2 ceases to be in force on **October 12, 2013**. This means that after this date, no further legal obligation or requirement under Section 12.2 applies to any party involved in the export of softwood lumber products under the Act.

4. **Coming Into Force Date:**  
   Although the regulation itself is issued to expire a section, it is **deemed to have come into force on October 13, 2013**. This date marks the official start of the legal effect of the regulation—i.e., the moment the expiry takes effect. The delay of one day between the expiry date (October 12) and the effective date (October 13) is common in regulatory instruments to allow for administrative processing, public notice, or to ensure compliance with procedural requirements.

5. **Legal and Regulatory Context:**  
   - The *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006* was enacted to address trade imbalances and ensure fair competition in the Canadian softwood lumber export market.  
   - The export charge regime includes various regulatory components, such as charges based on volume or value, and rules governing who is subject to the charge.  
   - Section 12.2 likely served a transitional, procedural, or administrative function that was no longer needed after the initial implementation phase or following a policy review.  
   - The expiry of this section reflects a deliberate shift in the regulatory design—possibly due to policy changes, renegotiations, or the completion of a temporary measure.

6. **Implications:**  
   - Exporters, importers, and regulatory bodies no longer need to comply with the requirements outlined in Section 12.2 after October 12, 2013.  
   - The regulatory framework for softwood lumber exports is now adjusted, with the removal of this specific rule.  
   - This change may have contributed to a simplification of the export charge system or the realignment of responsibilities between stakeholders.

7. **Governor General in Council and Ministerial Role:**  
   The regulation is issued by the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue. This reflects the standard administrative process in Canadian federal law, where the Minister proposes changes to regulations, and the Governor General formally approves them through a statutory instrument.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a formal, legally binding notice that removes a specific provision (Section 12.2) from the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006 Regulations*. It ensures that the provision is no longer enforceable after October 12, 2013, and the regulation itself becomes effective on October 13, 2013. The action reflects a policy evolution in the Canadian softwood lumber export regime, likely aimed at streamlining compliance, adjusting the scope of the export charge, or adapting to changing trade dynamics.  

This step marks a closure of a transitional or temporary regulatory component, contributing to the ongoing refinement of Canada’s trade policy in the softwood lumber sector.
