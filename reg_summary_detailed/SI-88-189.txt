**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Purpose and Context:**
This regulation addresses the cost of providing copies of certain tax-related documents to the public under subsection 149.1(15) of the *Income Tax Act*. Specifically, it establishes that the financial burden of producing and supplying copies of these documents should fall on the individuals or entities requesting them, rather than being borne by the Government of Canada.

The provision is rooted in the principle of cost recovery—ensuring that public services, including access to tax information, are not financially unsupported by those who benefit from them. This aligns with broader fiscal accountability and administrative efficiency goals within the Canadian public sector.

**2. Legal Authority:**
The regulation is authorized under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This paragraph grants the Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) the power to authorize fees for services provided by the Government, particularly where such services involve the production or delivery of information or documents.

The authorization is made on the recommendation of two key bodies:
- The **Minister of National Revenue**, who is responsible for administering the Income Tax Act and overseeing tax information access.
- The **Treasury Board**, which provides oversight and ensures that fees are consistent with broader fiscal and administrative policies.

**3. Key Provisions:**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** is empowered to issue a regulatory order (a formal rule or directive) that establishes a **specific fee** for individuals or organizations seeking copies of documents that are made available to the public under subsection 149.1(15) of the Income Tax Act.
- The documents in question are those that are legally accessible to the public under the Act, typically including tax returns, assessment notices, or other official records that are subject to disclosure under the Act’s provisions.
- The fee is to be **paid directly by the person receiving the copy**, meaning the requester is responsible for covering the administrative and production costs associated with preparing and delivering the document.

**4. Rationale and Objectives:**
- **Cost Recovery:** The government aims to ensure that the administrative costs of copying and distributing official documents are not borne by taxpayers or public funds.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** By requiring users to pay for copies, the system avoids unnecessary strain on public resources and encourages responsible use of information access.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The regulation reinforces the principle that public access to information comes with reasonable financial obligations, promoting fairness in the distribution of services.

**5. Scope and Application:**
- Applies specifically to **copies of documents** that are made available to the public under subsection 149.1(15) of the Income Tax Act.
- Does not apply to all tax information or to documents that are exempt from disclosure or are available free of charge under other provisions.
- The fee may vary depending on the type of document, the number of copies, or other factors as determined by the Minister in the order.

**6. Process and Implementation:**
- The Minister of National Revenue will issue a **formal order** (a regulatory instrument) that specifies:
  - The exact amount of the fee.
  - The circumstances under which the fee applies.
  - The method of payment and any applicable exemptions or reductions.
- This order will be published in the *Canada Gazette*, making it legally binding and publicly accessible.

**7. Oversight and Review:**
- The Treasury Board retains oversight to ensure that the fee is reasonable, proportionate, and consistent with public service standards.
- The Minister may review and adjust the fee periodically based on changes in administrative costs or public demand.

**Conclusion:**
This regulation formalizes a long-standing administrative principle: that access to public information should not come at the expense of government finances. By authorizing the Minister of National Revenue to set a fee for copies of publicly available tax documents, the government ensures sustainable, transparent, and equitable access to information while maintaining fiscal responsibility. It represents a practical step in balancing public access with administrative cost management under the framework of the Financial Administration Act.
