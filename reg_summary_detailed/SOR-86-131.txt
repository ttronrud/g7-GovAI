**Detailed Summary of the Electricity and Gas Inspection Regulations (1986)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Electricity and Gas Inspection Regulations*, effective **January 25, 1986**, were promulgated under **section 28 of the Electricity and Gas Inspection Act (Act)**. These regulations provide a comprehensive framework for the **inspection, verification, calibration, and recordkeeping** of electricity and gas meters and metering installations in Canada. They were developed following a public consultation period during which interested parties were invited to submit representations to the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.

These regulations ensure that meters used in the supply of electricity and gas are accurate, reliable, and meet established technical standards, thereby protecting consumers and maintaining fair billing practices.

## **Key Provisions and Structural Elements**

---

### **1. Definitions and Terminology**

The regulations establish precise definitions for key technical and procedural terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Absolute Pressure Scale** | Pressure scale where zero represents a perfect vacuum. |
| **Gauge Pressure Scale** | Pressure scale where zero represents atmospheric pressure. |
| **Average Flowing Gas Temperature** | Time- or volume-weighted average temperature of gas flowing through a meter. |
| **Average Meter Pressure** | Time- or volume-weighted average pressure within the meter. |
| **Measured Atmospheric Pressure** | Time- or volume-weighted average atmospheric pressure at the meter location. |
| **Standard Conditions** | Defined as 15°C (60°F) temperature and 101.325 kPa (14.73 psia / 30 in. Hg) pressure. |
| **Standard Volume** | Volume of gas measured at standard temperature and pressure. |
| **Measurement Canada Office** | Department of Industry offices responsible for administering the Act. |

> All meter-related terms (e.g., types, functions, components) are interpreted according to **applicable specifications** made available under sections 12, 18, 19, 44, and 45.

### **2. Exemptions from Reverification Requirements**

#### **A. Broken Seals – Exemption for Inspectors or Verifiers**
A gas meter with a broken seal may continue in service **without reverification** if:
- The seal was deliberately broken by an inspector or accredited verifier for **remote reading installation/removal**;
- No meter components (except register cover and register) were removed;
- Any removed parts were **promptly replaced**, with no change in register reading except for **volume increases** due to gas flow;
- The meter is **promptly resealed and re-marked** (restamped, relabeled, retagged) by an inspector or verifier per director’s specifications.

#### **B. Plastic or Small Metallic Filament Seals**
A meter originally sealed with:
- A **plastic filament** of any diameter, or
- A **metallic filament <0.644 mm** in diameter,

may remain in service with a broken seal **if**:
- There is **no visible sign** of tampering or alteration to working parts;
- The seal is **resealed by an inspector** in accordance with the Act and these regulations.

> These exemptions recognize that some seals are fragile or prone to breakage during routine maintenance and that tampering is not evident in such cases.

### **3. Calibration of Measuring Apparatus**

All measuring devices used for electricity or gas measurement or meter examination must be calibrated in two ways:

1. **Accuracy Testing**: Tested at multiple points across the full measuring range.
2. **Traceability to National Standard**: Accuracy at one or more test points must be **traced to reference standards maintained by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC)**.

> **Certification Requirement (Section 5):**
> - The director certifies calibration only if:
>   - The apparatus is calibrated per the prescribed method;
>   - The proposed installation and use are appropriate;
>   - No error exceeds **2%** of the reference standard value at any test point.
>
> A certificate is valid only for:
> - The specified measuring range;
> - The intended installation and use;
> - For certain instruments listed in a table, for a **specific period** (as defined in column II).

### **4. Contractor Registration and Requirements**

#### **Eligibility to Register**
To register under **section 6 of the Act**, a contractor must:
- Submit a **written application** indicating whether they offer electricity or gas services;
- Include:
  - Name of contractor;
  - Principal place of business;
  - Geographical area of operation.

#### **Register Maintenance**
- The **official register** contains all registered contractors and includes:
  - Name, address, and business area;
  - Details of registration and any changes.

#### **Change Notification**
- Contractors must **notify the director in writing** of any change in information (e.g., address, scope of operations).
- Must **return the updated certificate** to the director.

#### **Notice of Ceasing Operations**
- Upon ceasing to sell electricity or gas by metering:
  - A **notice must be sent by registered mail**;
  - Must state the **date of cessation**;
  - Must include details on the **disposition** (sale, scrapping, leasing, loss) of all meters owned, used, or possessed.

---

### **5. Owner’s Records – Mandatory Documentation**

Owners of verified or reverified meters must maintain detailed records for **each meter**, including:

#### **Core Information per Meter**
- Type designation, serial number, rating, multiplier (from manufacturer);
- Purchaser’s account number, name, address;
- Inspection number assigned by contractor;
- Date of latest re-verification and initial verification/purchase;
- Applicable reverification period (as per section 12);
- Most recent certificate from inspector or verifier;
- Parent group identification (for group metering);
- Current installation address;
- Date of installation at present location;
- For unsealed meters:
  - Dates and nature of maintenance;
  - Dates and results of calibration;
- Dates of sale, scrapping, leasing, or loss;
- For each billing period:
  - Metering information used to establish charges.

#### **Additional Gas Meter-Specific Information**
- Whether the meter corrects for temperature, pressure, or both;
- Metric conversion factor used for billing;
- Mean atmospheric pressure or calculated/measured atmospheric pressure;
- Pressure multiplier (if regulated pressure is maintained);
- If average meter pressure exceeds mean atmospheric pressure by more than:
  - **3.5 kPa (0.5 psi)** → must record:
    - Average meter pressure on **gauge pressure scale** (for non-pressure-converting meters);

- The end of the calendar year to which the records apply (subsection 3);
- The end of use of a metering installation (subsection 4);
