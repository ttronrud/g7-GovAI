## 📚 **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act*. |

## 💰 **Prescribed Expenses**

- **What is prescribed**:  
  Expenses incurred by FINTRAC in relation to:
  - Ensuring compliance with **Parts 1 and 1.1** of the Act (i.e., the reporting and compliance obligations of financial institutions).
  - FINTRAC’s activities under **Sections 51.1 to 51.3** of the Act (specifically, the assessment and collection of fees).

> These expenses are **prescribed under subsection 51.1(1)** of the Act — meaning they are eligible for assessment against qualifying entities.

---

## 🏢 **Who is Subject to Assessment? (Prescribed Entities under subsection 51.1(3))**

Entities that must pay an assessment are categorized into four groups:

### 1. **Entities Covered by Banking or Insurance Laws**
- Every **bank** to which the *Bank Act* applies.
- Every **authorized foreign bank** (as defined in Section 2 of the *Bank Act*).
- Every **life company or foreign life company** to which the *Insurance Companies Act* applies.
- Every **company** to which the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* applies.

> These are large, regulated financial institutions with inherent compliance obligations.

### 2. **Entities That Made 500 or More Specified Reports in a Fiscal Year**
- Any **person or entity** (not covered in 1 above) that submitted **500 or more specified reports** during the fiscal year in which the expenses were incurred.

> This group includes smaller institutions, fintechs, or other businesses with significant transaction reporting activity.

> **Note**: If an entity made fewer than 500 reports, it is **not assessed** under this rule.

## 📊 **Prescribed Information**

- All data required to calculate assessments (e.g., asset values, number of reports, CPI indices) is considered **prescribed information** under **Section 51.3** of the Act.
- This ensures transparency and consistency in calculations and enables independent verification.

## ✍️ **Assessment Requirements**

All assessments must be made in **writing**, as required by subsection **51.1(3)** of the Act.

### 🔢 **Assessment Formulas by Entity Type**

#### ✅ **For Entities in Paragraph 3(a) – Banks, Life Companies, Trust/Loan Companies**
> Formula:
>  
> **Assessment = Base Assessment Amount + Proportional Assessment Amount – Interim Assessment**

Where:
- **Base Assessment Amount** = determined under **Section 7**
- **Proportional Assessment Amount** = determined under **Section 8**
- **Interim Assessment** = any amount already assessed during the fiscal year (if any)

> This formula ensures a **base fee** (based on size and assets) plus a **proportional share** of FINTRAC’s costs, adjusted for prior assessments.

---

### 🔢 **Base Assessment Amount (Section 7)**

This is a tiered fee based on the **value of the entity’s assets in Canada** at the end of its financial year (which ends in the fiscal year).

| Asset Value Range | Base Assessment |
|------------------|-----------------|
| ≥ $1 trillion | $250,000 |
| ≥ $500 billion – < $1 trillion | $200,000 |
| ≥ $100 billion – < $500 billion | $150,000 |
| ≥ $10 billion – < $100 billion | $100,000 |
| ≥ $1 billion – < $10 billion | $75,000 |
| ≥ $500 million – < $1 billion | $50,000 |
| ≥ $100 million – < $500 million | $25,000 |
| ≥ $10 million – < $100 million | $10,000 |
| ≥ $0 – < $10 million | $5,000 |
| ≤ $0 | Nil |

> **Adjustment for Inflation**:  
> The base amount is adjusted using **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**:
> - **CPI factor**:  
>   `CPI_fiscal_year / CPI_2024`  
>   (where both are average all-items CPI values from Statistics Canada, not seasonally adjusted)

> Example: If the CPI in 2024 was 100 and in 2025 was 110, the base amount is increased by 10%.

> **Rounding Rule**:  
> Final base amount is **rounded to the nearest $10**. If equidistant, **round up**.

---

### 🔢 **Proportional Assessment Amount (Section 8)**

For entities in **Group 3(a)**:

> Formula:
>  
> **Proportional Assessment = (FINTRAC Expenses × [N / O]) × (Entity’s Asset Value / Total Assets of All Group 3(a) Entities)**

Where:
- **FINTRAC Expenses** = total expenses incurred by FINTRAC in the fiscal year (Section 2)
- **N** = total number of specified reports made by **all Group 3(a) entities** during the fiscal year
- **O** = total number of specified reports made by **all persons and entities** during the fiscal year
- **Entity’s Asset Value** = value of the entity’s assets in Canada at year-end
- **Total Assets of Group 3(a)** = sum of all Group 3(a) entities’ asset values at year-end

> This formula ensures that **larger reporting entities** contribute more proportionally to the cost of compliance.

> **Note**: If an entity's asset value is negative, it is treated as **nil**.

---

### 🔢 **Proportional Assessment for Group 3(b), (c), and (d)**

For:
- Entities in **3(b)** or **3(c)** (life/trust companies) that made **500 or more reports**, or
- Any **person/entity in 3(d)** (non-financial entities with 500+ reports)

> Formula:
>  
> **Proportional Assessment = (FINTRAC Expenses × [M / P]) × (Entity’s Report Count / Total Reports by 3(b)/(c) and 3(d))**

Where:
- **M** = total number of reports made by **all entities NOT in 3(a)** during the fiscal year
- **P** = total number of reports made by **all persons and entities** during the fiscal year
- **Entity’s Report Count** = number of reports made by the entity
- **Total Reports by 3(b)/(c) and 3(d)** = sum of reports made by all entities in those groups that made 500+ reports

> This ensures that **entities with high reporting volumes** (even if not large in size) are assessed fairly based on their **volume of reporting activity**.

> ⚠️ **Important**:  
> If an entity in 3(b) or 3(c) made **fewer than 500 reports**, its proportional assessment is **nil**.
