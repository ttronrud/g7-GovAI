## 🔍 **Overall Context and Status**

- **Regulation Title**: *Radiation Emitting Devices Regulations* (SOR/2022-197, s. 24; later amended)
- **Repealed/Revoked Sections**:
  - The **Minister** designation was **repealed** by **SOR/2024-196, s. 1**.
  - The **"maximum test voltage" and "service control/user control" definitions** were **revoked** by **SOR/88-471, s. 1** and **SOR/94-40, s. 1**, respectively.
  - The **entire television receiver standards section** (including emission limits and labeling) was **revoked** under **SOR/94-40, s. 1**, indicating that **older standards for TVs are no longer applicable**.
- **Current Status**:  
  The regulation **retains the classification of radiation-emitting devices** and **prescribes standards for key medical and industrial devices**, but **many technical requirements (especially for TVs) are no longer in effect** due to repeal.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: This regulation is **partially active** — it **defines classes of radiation-emitting devices** and **prescribes standards** for certain medical and industrial equipment, but **many specific technical and performance requirements (especially for TVs)** have been **repealed or revoked** and are **no longer enforceable**.

## 📚 I. Key Definitions and Prescribed Classes of Devices

### 1. **"Act"**
- Refers to the *Radiation Emitting Devices Act* (REDA), which establishes the legal framework for regulating radiation-emitting devices.

### 2. **"Device"**
- A radiation-emitting device that falls within a class prescribed in **Schedule I** of the regulations.

### 3. **Prescribed Classes (Schedule I)**
These are the types of radiation-emitting devices subject to regulation under the Act:

| Device Class | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Television receivers** | Includes video monitors and displays that receive signals via electromagnetic waves, cable, or other means. Excludes devices not designed to display images. |
| **Dental X-ray equipment** | Devices designed primarily to examine dental and maxillofacial structures in living humans. Includes X-ray tubes used outside the mouth. |
| **Microwave ovens** | Appliances or sets designed to supply microwave energy to material inside a cavity. |
| **Baggage inspection X-ray devices** | Used to examine carry-on baggage, parcels, mail, etc. Includes generator, detector, and control/display systems. |
| **Demonstration-type gas discharge devices** | Devices that produce glow discharges or X-rays to demonstrate physical phenomena (e.g., electron flow). |
| **Photofluorographic X-ray equipment** | Used to examine the human chest and record reduced-size images on fluorescent screens. |
| **Laser products** | Devices that produce or amplify electromagnetic radiation from **180 nm to 1 mm** (UV to far-infrared), primarily via stimulated emission. |
| **Low Energy Electron Microscopes** *(Repealed)* | Devices with ≤500 keV electron beam used to image minute objects. **Revoked by SOR/88-471** → **No longer in force**. |
| **High-intensity mercury vapour discharge lamps** | Lamps with high-pressure arc tubes filled primarily with mercury (e.g., metal halide, self-ballasted). **Excludes tungsten filament lamps**. |
| **Tanning equipment** | As defined in **Section 1 of Part XI of Schedule II** (not fully detailed here). |
| **Diagnostic X-ray equipment** | Devices using X-rays for body examination. **Excludes**: dental, photofluorographic, radiation therapy simulators, CT scanners. |
| **Ultrasound therapy devices** | Devices generating ultrasonic power (>20 kHz) for physical therapy. |
| **Analytical X-ray equipment** | X-ray tubes used to determine elemental composition or microstructure of materials. |
| **Cabinet X-ray equipment** | X-ray devices with tubes permanently installed in a cabinet, designed to examine material placed inside. Excludes analytical and baggage inspection types. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: The **low-energy electron microscope** and **some television standards** have been **officially revoked**, so these are **no longer enforceable**.

## 📝 II. Key Regulatory Requirements (Still in Force)

### 1. **Labeling Requirements for Medical Devices (Imported)**
> *Repealed in part by SOR/2024-196, s. 1 — but the core principle remains relevant.*

- **Any person importing a medical device** (as defined in *Medical Devices Regulations*) that is **not labeled in accordance with these regulations** must:
  - Ensure the **manufacturer relabels** the device **within 3 months** of importation before selling or leasing it.

> ✅ This requirement ensures **consumer safety and regulatory compliance** for medical devices entering the market.

---

### 2. **Seizure and Detention of Devices by Inspectors**

An inspector may seize a device or component under **subsection 10(1) of the Act** and:

#### (a) Detain the device for:
- Determining compliance with these regulations.

#### (b) Store or remove it for:
- Testing whether it complies with prescribed standards.

#### (c) Release it **conditionally**, such as:
- **Destroy it immediately** or retain it until destroyed;
- Return it to the **country of origin**;
- Return it to the **manufacturer, distributor, or importer** and require compliance with standards.

> ✅ This provides **enforcement power** to ensure devices meet safety and performance standards.

---

### 3. **Record of Seizure (Mandatory)**
The inspector must keep a **written record** that includes:
- Place, date, and hour of seizure;
- Name of owner or person on whose premises it was seized;
- Manufacturer, model number, date and place of manufacture;
- Location to which it was removed (if any);
- How it was dealt with after seizure.

> ✅ The **owner or employee** must **sign and receive a copy** of the record.

> ⚠️ If a device is released **on condition** and that condition is **not met**, the inspector may **re-seize** it.

---

### 4. **Disposal of Forfeited Devices**
If a **court orders forfeiture** to Her Majesty (under subsection 16(1) of the Act), and:
- No application is made under **section 75 of the Fisheries Act**, **or**
- A declaration under subsection 75(4) is not included in the final order,

Then the **Minister may direct the disposal** of the device.

> ✅ This ensures **proper handling of illegal or non-compliant devices** after judicial determination.

---

## 📐 III. Technical Standards (Where Still Applicable)

Although many standards were revoked, **some remain in force**, especially for **dental X-ray equipment**.

### A. **Dental X-Ray Equipment – Mandatory Information to Be Provided**
