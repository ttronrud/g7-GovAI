**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Hog Marketing Administration Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order, 1998 (SOR/97-422, C.R.C., c. 154)**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, known as the *Manitoba Hog Marketing Administration Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order, 1998*, was issued by the **Manitoba Pork Est.** (Manitoba Pork Marketing Board) under **Section 4a of the Manitoba Hog Order**. It establishes a system of levies that producers must pay when hogs are marketed **interprovincially or exported** from Manitoba.

The regulation came into force on **September 16, 1998**, and replaced an earlier version (SOR/84-701), which was formally repealed by this Order.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Definitions**
The regulation begins with clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba*, C.C.S.M. c. N20 (French: *Loi*). This Act provides the legal framework under which the Producer Board operates and collects marketing levies.
  
- **Hog**: Defined as a member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig), regardless of breed, grade, or class. This includes all types of pigs raised in Manitoba.

- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the **production of hogs** within the Province of Manitoba. This includes farmers, ranchers, or any person involved in raising pigs for commercial purposes.

- **Producer Board**: The *Manitoba Pork Est.* (Manitoba Pork Marketing Board), which continues to operate under the authority granted by subsection 3(1) of the *Manitoba Hog Producers’ Marketing Plan Regulation* made under the Natural Products Marketing Act.

---

#### **2. Levy Structure**
Producers are required to pay a levy based on the type of hog being marketed:

| Type of Hog | Levy per Head |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Weanling hog** (pig less than 6 months old, typically just after weaning) | **$0.20** |
| **All other hogs** (including growing pigs, breeding stock, and market hogs) | **$0.85** |

> **Note**: The levy applies only to hogs marketed **outside Manitoba** — that is, in interprovincial trade or for export.

This tiered structure reflects the differing market values and production costs associated with different stages of pig development.

---

#### **3. Payment Requirements**
- Every producer must pay the applicable levy to the **Producer Board**.
- Payment must be made **within seven days** of receiving an invoice from the Producer Board.
- The invoice serves as formal notification of the levy due and provides the details of the hogs marketed (e.g., number, type, value).

Failure to pay within the seven-day period may result in penalties or enforcement actions, although such consequences are not explicitly detailed in this Order.

---

#### **4. Repeal of Previous Regulation**
This Order **repeals** the previous *Manitoba Hog Marketing Administration Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order, 1984* (SOR/84-701), which had established a similar levy system. This repeal indicates a policy update or refinement in the administrative and financial framework for hog marketing in Manitoba.

---

### **Purpose and Context**
The primary purpose of this regulation is to:

- Generate revenue for the **Manitoba Pork Est.** to support the marketing, promotion, and development of the pork industry.
- Ensure that producers contributing to interprovincial and export markets contribute fairly to the costs of marketing and distribution.
- Provide a transparent, standardized, and enforceable system for collecting levies based on the type and stage of hogs.

These levies help fund activities such as:
- Branding and marketing of Manitoba pork
- Promotion of pork in domestic and international markets
- Research and development in pig production and food safety
- Support for sustainable and responsible farming practices

---

### **Legal Basis**
The regulation is authorized under:
- **Section 4a of the Manitoba Hog Order**, which empowers the Producer Board to establish levies for interprovincial and export trade.
- The broader authority of the **Natural Products Marketing Act (C.C.S.M. c. N20)**, which governs the structure, functions, and financial operations of producer marketing boards in Manitoba.

---

### **Implementation and Enforcement**
- The **Manitoba Pork Est.** is responsible for issuing invoices and collecting the levies.
- Producers are expected to maintain records of hog sales and ensure timely payment.
- The regulation is administered and enforced by the Producer Board, operating under the oversight of the provincial government.

---

### **Effective Date**
The Order came into force on **September 16, 1998**, meaning that all producers began complying with the new levy structure from that date.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Manitoba Hog Marketing Administration Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order, 1998* establishes a clear, equitable, and legally grounded system for collecting marketing levies from hog producers in Manitoba. By charging a tiered levy based on hog type, it ensures that both young and mature pigs contribute to the marketing infrastructure of the province’s pork industry. The replacement of the 1984 Order reflects an update to the regulatory framework, improving efficiency and alignment with current market conditions.

This regulation remains a key component of Manitoba’s agricultural marketing policy, supporting the economic viability and competitiveness of the provincial pork sector in both domestic and international markets.
