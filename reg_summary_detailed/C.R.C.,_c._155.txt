The regulation you provided—**SOR/2001-16, s. 2**—is a **repealed** regulation under the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba*. As such, it no longer has legal effect. However, the content of the regulation can still be summarized in detail for historical, interpretive, or contextual understanding.

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation (SOR/2001-16, s. 2)**

#### **1. Definitions**
The regulation begins by defining key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* (Loi), which provides the legal framework for the regulation of milk marketing in Manitoba.
- **Commodity Board**: Refers to *The Manitoba Milk Producers’ Marketing Board*, a body established under the Act to oversee the marketing of milk in the province.
- **Milk**: Defined as milk or cream from cows produced in Manitoba for consumer use in liquid form within Canada.
- **Plan**: Refers to any marketing plan for milk established and amended over time under the Act.

These definitions establish the scope and subject matter of the regulation.

#### **2. Authority to Regulate Interprovincial Trade**
> *"Subject to subsection (2), the Commodity Board is authorized to regulate the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade and for those purposes may, with respect to persons and property situated within the Province of Manitoba, exercise all or any powers like the powers exercisable by the Commodity Board in relation to the marketing of milk locally within that Province under the Act and the Plan."*

**Key Points:**
- The Commodity Board is granted **regulatory authority over the interprovincial marketing of milk**—that is, milk being sold across provincial borders.
- This authority allows the Board to exercise **powers similar to those it has within Manitoba**, including setting rules, standards, and conditions for marketing, **as long as those powers are consistent with the Act and the Plan**.
- The power is **limited to persons and property located within Manitoba**—meaning the Board can regulate how Manitoba-produced milk is marketed outside the province, but cannot directly regulate out-of-province producers or their operations.

**Note**: This provision gives the Commodity Board a role in shaping market conditions for Manitoba milk in national trade, particularly in setting rules around pricing, quality, or volume.

#### **3. Exclusion of Canadian Dairy Commission Powers**
> *"The authority to regulate the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade does not include any power that is exercised by the Canadian Dairy Commission under the Canadian Dairy Commission Act in relation to the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade."*

**Key Points:**
- The Commodity Board **does not have authority over powers already exercised by the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act*.
- This clause **creates a clear boundary** between the Manitoba Commodity Board and the federal CDC.
- It ensures that **federal responsibilities (e.g., national pricing, supply chain coordination, or national marketing policies)** remain under the jurisdiction of the CDC, not the provincial board.
- This prevents overlap or duplication of regulatory functions and respects the division of powers between federal and provincial governments.

#### **4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**
> *"The Commodity Board may, in relation to the powers granted to it under section 3, fix and impose levies or charges on milk or any component of milk and collect the levies or charges from persons described in subsection 3(1) who are engaged in the production or marketing of milk and for those purposes may classify those persons into groups and fix the levies or charges payable by the members of the different groups in different amounts;"*

**Key Points:**
- The Board can **establish and collect levies or charges** on milk or its components (e.g., fat, protein).
- The levy system applies to **persons involved in the production or marketing of milk**, as defined in section 3(1) of the Act.
- The Board has **flexibility to classify producers or marketers into different groups** (e.g., small farms vs. large dairies) and **set different rates** for each group.
- This allows for **targeted financial management**, ensuring that smaller producers may be charged less or receive support through differential rates.

#### **5. Use of Levies and Charges**
> *"and use the levies or charges for the purposes of the Commodity Board, including the creation of reserves, the payment of expenses and losses resulting from the sale or disposal of milk and the equalization or adjustment among producers of milk of moneys realized from the sale thereof during such period or periods of time as the Commodity Board may determine."*

**Key Purposes of Levies:**
- **Creation of reserves**: To build financial buffers for future market downturns or price volatility.
- **Payment of expenses and losses**: Covers administrative costs and losses incurred due to poor market conditions (e.g., when milk prices fall below cost).
- **Equalization or adjustment among producers**: To redistribute income among producers to ensure fairness. For example:
  - If some producers sell milk at high prices during a good year, they may contribute more to a fund.
  - In a poor year, the fund can be used to provide financial support to producers who received lower returns.
- The Board may determine **when and how** these adjustments are made—this gives it discretion over timing and conditions.

---

### **Overall Purpose and Context**
This regulation was designed to:
- Enable the **Manitoba Milk Producers’ Marketing Board** to play a **provincial role in managing the interprovincial marketing of milk**.
- Provide **financial tools (levies)** to stabilize the milk market, protect producers, and ensure equitable outcomes.
- Clearly **exclude federal authority** (via the Canadian Dairy Commission) to avoid regulatory overlap.
- Maintain **provincial control** over marketing decisions related to milk within Manitoba's borders.

---

### **Status: Repealed**
> The regulation is explicitly marked as **repealed** under SOR/2001-16, section 2.

This means:
- The regulation is **no longer in force**.
- Its provisions have been **replaced, amended, or superseded** by newer legislation or policy.
- Any current regulatory framework governing milk marketing in Manitoba now operates under updated laws (e.g., amendments to the *Natural Products Marketing Act* or other provincial or federal regulations).

---

### **Conclusion**
Although this regulation is **repealed**, it historically represented a significant step in enabling Manitoba to:
- Regulate the interprovincial marketing of milk,
- Implement producer-based levies and financial equalization,
- Maintain autonomy from federal dairy commissions.

It reflects an early effort by Manitoba to balance **market efficiency**, **producer protection**, and **provincial self-governance** in the dairy sector—though that framework has since been revised or replaced.
