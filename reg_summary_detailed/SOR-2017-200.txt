### **Detailed Summary of the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Regulatory Background**

These regulations are formally adopted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act (R.S., c. A-2)**, specifically **paragraphs 5.4(2)(b)a and (c)a**, which empower the Minister of Transport to establish zoning rules to ensure the safe operation of airports and related aeronautical facilities.

The proposed regulations were **publicly advertised** in multiple local newspapers (Hamilton Spectator, Brantford Expositor, Brant News, Régional) on **March 16 and 23, 2016**, and published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette, Part I** on **March 5 and 12, 2016**. This ensured a **reasonable opportunity for public comment and stakeholder input** before final adoption.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

- To **prevent development or use** of land adjacent to or near the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport that could interfere with the **safe operation of aircraft**.
- To **prevent interference with critical aeronautical signals and communications** (e.g., radar, radio, navigation systems) by prohibiting developments or natural growths that could block or disrupt signals between aircraft and airport facilities.

These measures are designed to protect aviation safety, especially during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined within the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton, Ontario, as described in Part 8 of the schedule. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used to calculate elevations and surface boundaries. Located at coordinates **587,398.59 E, 4,780,360.83 N**, with an assigned elevation of **230.00 m** (CGVD28). |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined surface extending from each end of a runway strip. Designed to ensure aircraft have a clear path during approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 m above the ARP**, but **no lower than 9 m above ground level**. Acts as a boundary for development. |
| **Strip Surface** | An imaginary surface associated with each runway, extending along the runway’s centerline. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined surface extending from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces. Helps prevent obstructions in the area between the runway and the outer surface. |
| **Wildlife Hazard Zone** | A designated area near the airport where activities attracting birds or other wildlife are restricted to prevent bird strikes. |
| **Zoning Plan** | Plan File No. 25-009:10-005 (Sheets 1–40), prepared by the Department of Public Works and Government Services in March 2012, which serves as the spatial framework for these regulations. |

#### **4. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport** within the boundary defined in **Part 6 of the schedule**. This includes:

- Land **under water**
- Public road allowances (e.g., road rights-of-way)

The boundaries are strictly defined using **grid coordinates** based on the **NAD83 (1989 adjustment)** UTM projection (Zone 17), with all measurements in **metres**.

#### **5. Prohibited Activities and Developments**

##### **(a) Construction or Development Restrictions**
No person may:
- Place, erect, construct, or permit the placement or construction of:
  - Any **building, structure, or object**
  - Any **addition to an existing structure**
- That would **penetrate** any of the following surfaces:
  - Approach surface
  - Outer surface
  - Transitional surface
  - Strip surface

> *This means that even small structures (e.g., sheds, fences, antennas) or parts of existing structures that extend above these surfaces are strictly prohibited.*

##### **(b) Use or Development Near the Outer Surface**
No person may:
- Use or develop any land **under the outer surface** in a way that causes **interference with signals or communications** to or from:
  - Aircraft
  - Aeronautical service facilities (e.g., radar, control towers)

> *This includes radio towers, wireless transmitters, or any electronic equipment that could disrupt flight operations.*

##### **(c) Uncontrolled Natural Growth**
No person may:
- Permit **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, bushes, tall grass) to grow in a way that **penetrates** any of the following:
  - Approach surface
  - Outer surface
  - Transitional surface
  - Strip surface

> *This ensures that vegetation does not create hazards during approach or takeoff, especially in critical zones.*

##### **(d) Wildlife Attraction Restrictions**
No person may:
- Use or permit use of the **wildlife hazard zone** (Part 7 of the schedule) for activities that **attract birds or other wildlife** (e.g., open fields, feeding, hunting, or waste disposal), as such activities pose a **direct hazard to aviation safety**.

> *Bird strikes are a major aviation risk, so this restriction aims to reduce the likelihood of such incidents.*

##### **(e) Exception for Open Water Reservoirs**
Despite the above restrictions, a person **may**:
- Use or permit use of land in the wildlife hazard zone as a **site for an open water storage reservoir** for a **maximum of 48 hours**.

> *This exception is limited in duration and scope, ensuring that short-term water storage does not compromise safety.*

#### **6. Surface Descriptions and Technical Details**

##### **(a) Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Coordinates: **587,398.59 E, 4,780,360.83 N**
- Elevation: **230.00 m (CGVD28)**
- Located at the intersection of the centerline of Strip Surface 06-24 and a 180 m southeasterly offset from its eastern end.

##### **(b) Approach Surfaces**
Each approach surface is an inclined plane extending from the ends of runways 06-24 and 12-30. Key details:

| Approach Surface | Start Elevation | Gradient (First 3,000 m) | Gradient (Beyond 3,000 m) | Outer Edge Distance | Outer Edge Elevation |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **06** | 228.30 m | 1:60 (1 m up per 60 m horizontal) | 1:50 | 3,000 m → 9,000 m | 170 m above start |
| **24** | 230.30 m | 1:60 | 1:50 | 3,000 m → 15,000 m | 290 m above start |
| **12** | 235.50 m | 1:60 | 1:50 | 3,000 m → 15,000 m | 290 m above start |
| **30** | 233.30 m | 1:60 | 1:50 | 3,000 m → 15,000 m | 290 m above start |

> *These surfaces ensure that aircraft approaching the runway have a clear visual and physical path, free from obstructions.*

##### **(c) Outer Surface**
- Maintains a **constant elevation of 45 m above the ARP** (i.e., 275.00 m at ARP)
- However, **cannot fall below 9 m above ground level**
- Covers a large area across Hamilton, bounded by major roads and property lines

> *This creates a "no-development" zone around the airport, protecting against interference with radar and communications.*

##### **(d) Transitional Surface**
- Extends from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces
- Inclined upward from the edges of the strip surfaces
- Designed to provide a buffer zone between the runway and the outer surface

> *Prevents obstructions from forming in the lateral area near runways.*

##### **(e) Wildlife Hazard Zone**
- Defined in **Part 7 of the schedule**
- Includes areas where bird activity is high
- Activities that attract birds (e.g., open fields, feeding, waste) are prohibited

> *This is a critical safety zone to prevent bird strikes, which can damage aircraft engines and cause crashes.*
