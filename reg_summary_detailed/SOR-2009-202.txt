**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation:**

---

### **Title of the Document:**  
**Proclamation Declaring Sandy Pond in Newfoundland and Labrador Exempt from Section 22 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act**

---

### **Issuing Authority:**  
The Governor in Council of Canada, acting under the authority of the **Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA)**, and by the **Royal Proclamation** issued on behalf of **Queen Elizabeth II**, as Head of the Commonwealth and Sovereign of Canada.

The proclamation was signed by **Michaëlle Jean**, the Governor General of Canada, on **June 23, 2009**, at the Government House in Ottawa.

---

### **Legal Basis:**

This proclamation is grounded in **Section 23 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA)**, which empowers the Governor in Council to issue a proclamation declaring certain rivers, streams, or waters — or parts thereof — **exempt from the operation of Section 22** of the Act, **if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Council that the public interest would not be injuriously affected** by such exemption.

- **Section 22** of the NWPA generally prohibits the construction, alteration, or operation of structures (such as dams, bridges, or culverts) on or in navigable waters without prior approval from the federal government.
- **Section 23** provides a mechanism for limited exemptions when public interest is not harmed.

---

### **Subject of the Proclamation:**

- **Sandy Pond**, located in **Newfoundland and Labrador**, is declared **exempt from the operation of Section 22 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act**.
- The exemption applies **in whole or in part**, depending on the specific nature of the water body and the activities involved.
- The exemption is **not a blanket waiver** of all federal environmental or navigational controls, but rather a specific, legally justified exception under the Act.

---

### **Reason for the Exemption:**

The Governor in Council is **satisfied that exempting Sandy Pond from Section 22 would not injure the public interest**. This determination was based on a thorough assessment of:

- The ecological, environmental, and hydrological characteristics of Sandy Pond;
- The potential impacts of restricting development or infrastructure projects on the pond;
- The need for local development, agricultural, or economic activities (such as land use, infrastructure, or community needs);
- The absence of significant risks to public safety, water quality, or navigability.

The exemption is intended to balance **environmental protection** with **practical community needs** and **economic development**.

---

### **Legal Process and Precedent:**

- The proclamation follows **Order in Council P.C. 2009-850**, issued on **May 28, 2009**, which authorized the issuance of the proclamation.
- This order demonstrates the formal administrative process: the Governor in Council first issued a directive, and then the proclamation was issued as a formal legal instrument.
- The proclamation is **published officially**, and all persons affected or interested are required to take notice and act accordingly.

---

### **Scope and Effect:**

- The exemption applies **only to Sandy Pond**, and **only to the specific waters or parts** designated under the proclamation.
- It does **not** exempt the pond from other federal, provincial, or local regulations (e.g., environmental assessments, land use planning, or water quality standards).
- The exemption is **temporary in nature** and may be reviewed or revoked if future assessments show that public interest has been harmed.

---

### **Purpose and Significance:**

- Allows for **local development or infrastructure projects** (e.g., drainage, land reclamation, or small-scale construction) that would otherwise be blocked under Section 22 of the NWPA.
- Supports **regional economic development** in Newfoundland and Labrador by reducing regulatory barriers.
- Demonstrates the **flexibility of federal environmental law** when public interest is adequately protected.
- Reinforces the principle that environmental protection is not absolute and must be balanced with practical community needs.

---

### **Formal Elements of the Proclamation:**

- **Proclamation by Royal Authority**: The document is issued in the name of the Queen, by the Governor General, representing the Crown.
- **Public Notice Requirement**: All individuals, entities, and governments affected by the proclamation are required to take notice and govern themselves accordingly.
- **Seal and Signature**: The Great Seal of Canada is affixed, and the Governor General signs the proclamation as Commander-in-Chief and representative of the Crown.
- **Date and Place**: Issued on **June 23, 2009**, in Ottawa.
