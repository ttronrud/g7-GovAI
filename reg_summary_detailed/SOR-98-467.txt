**Detailed Summary of the Amnesty Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (S.C. 1995, c. 39, s. 139)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, made under **subsection 117.14(1)a of the Criminal Code**, establishes a **specific amnesty period** from **December 1, 1998, to December 31, 2005**, during which certain individuals and businesses who were in possession of **prohibited handguns** are **exempt from criminal liability** under **Part III of the Criminal Code**—specifically, offences related to the unlawful possession of prohibited firearms—**if they were acting in compliance with specific lawful actions**.

The order is a legal mechanism to provide **non-punitive relief** to individuals and entities who legally acquired or held certain prohibited handguns prior to the implementation of stricter firearm regulations in Canada. It recognizes that some individuals had legitimate reasons to possess such firearms before the new rules took effect and aims to reduce legal penalties for those who disposed of or deactivated them in accordance with prescribed procedures.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Former Act**  
   Refers to the *Firearms Act* prior to its current version (the modern *Firearms Act* enacted in 1995). This definition aligns with the meaning used in subsection 2(1) of the original Act.

2. **Prohibited Handgun**  
   A handgun that falls under paragraph (a) of the definition of *prohibited firearm* in **subsection 84(1) of the Criminal Code**. These are typically firearms that are banned due to their design or intended use (e.g., handguns with certain barrel lengths or calibers).

3. **Public Service Agency**  
   Has the same meaning as defined in **Section 1 of the Public Agents Firearms Regulations**—organizations such as government departments, hospitals, or institutions that operate under public authority and are authorized to possess firearms for official duties.

## **Main Amnesty Provisions**

The amnesty applies to individuals and businesses who were in possession of a prohibited handgun during the period **December 1, 1998 – December 31, 2005**, provided the handgun was acquired and registered **after February 14, 1995**, and before December 1, 1998. The key exception is for handguns specifically mentioned in **subsection 12(6) of the Firearms Act**, which are treated differently.

### **1. General Amnesty for Individuals (Non-Exempt Cases)**

Any individual who:
- Acquired a prohibited handgun **after February 14, 1995**, and **before December 1, 1998**,
- And who was **not** covered by subsection 12(6) of the Firearms Act,

**cannot be found guilty of an offence under Part III of the Criminal Code solely because** they were in possession of that handgun **during the amnesty period**, **if** they were doing or prior to doing any of the following lawful acts:

✅ Deactivating the handgun so it is no longer a firearm  
✅ Changing the barrel length to make it a restricted firearm and turning in the prohibited barrel to a police officer or firearms officer  
✅ Exporting the handgun in compliance with all applicable legal requirements (including destination country laws)  
✅ Turning in the handgun to a police officer or firearms officer for destruction or other lawful disposal  
✅ Selling or giving the handgun to:
   - A business (including museums) licensed under **subsection 11(2) of the Firearms Act** to possess such a handgun, or  
   - A public service agency

> **Note:** This exemption applies only if the handgun was acquired and registered after Feb 14, 1995 and before Dec 1, 1998.

---

### **2. Amnesty for Individuals Holding Handguns from Subsection 12(6) of the Firearms Act**

This provision applies to individuals who:
- Were **not** individuals referred to in subsection 12(6) of the Firearms Act,
- But possessed a prohibited handgun **referred to in subsection 12(6)**,
- That was acquired **after Feb 14, 1995**, and **before Dec 1, 1998**,
- And for which a registration certificate was issued or applied for by **another individual** under the *former Act* (i.e., not directly registered by the holder).

**They cannot be found guilty of an offence under Part III of the Criminal Code solely due to possession**, if they engaged in any of the following lawful actions:

✅ Deactivating the handgun  
✅ Changing barrel length to make it a restricted firearm and turning in the prohibited barrel  
✅ Exporting in compliance with all legal requirements  
✅ Turning in the handgun to police/firearms officer for destruction or disposal  
✅ Selling or giving the handgun to:
   - A licensed business (e.g., museum) under subsection 11(2) of the Firearms Act, or  
   - A public service agency  
✅ Selling or giving the handgun to an individual **referred to in subsection 12(6)** who is **licensed** to possess such a handgun

> This provision protects individuals who inherited or obtained a prohibited handgun through a third party under the old regime.

### **3. Amnesty for Business Holders (Former Business Permit Holders)**

This section applies to persons who held a **permit to carry on a business** under **subsection 105(4) of the former Act** (i.e., businesses that were legally authorized to deal in firearms).

#### **Subsection A: Handguns Acquired on or Before February 14, 1995**

Any person who:
- Held such a business permit,
- And possessed a prohibited handgun **acquired on or before Feb 14, 1995**,
- And reported it to the Commissioner or an authorized person under **paragraph 105(1.1)(d) of the former Act**,

**Cannot be found guilty of an offence under Part III of the Criminal Code solely due to possession**, if they did any of the following:

✅ Deactivated the handgun  
✅ Changed barrel length to restricted status and turned in prohibited barrel  
✅ Exported in compliance with all legal requirements  
✅ Turned in the handgun to police/firearms officer for destruction or disposal  
✅ Sold or gave the handgun to:
   - A licensed business (e.g., museum) under subsection 11(2) of the Firearms Act, or  
   - A public service agency

> This provision protects legacy businesses that had lawful possession of firearms before the new regulations.

#### **Subsection B: Handguns Acquired After February 14, 1995**

Any person who:
- Held a business permit under subsection 105(4) of the former Act,
- And possessed a prohibited handgun **acquired after Feb 14, 1995**,
- And reported it under paragraph 105(1.1)(d) of the former Act,

**Cannot be found guilty of an offence under Part III of the Criminal Code solely due to possession**, if they did any of the following:

✅ Deactivated the handgun  
✅ Changed barrel length to restricted status and turned in prohibited barrel  
✅ Turned in the handgun to police/firearms officer for destruction or disposal

> **Note:** This provision does **not** cover selling or giving the handgun to a licensed business or public service agency.

> **Reasoning:** The stricter reporting and licensing requirements after Feb 14, 1995 likely reduced the number of such holdings, and this provision reflects a more limited amnesty for those who were compliant in reporting but not in transferring ownership.

### **Special Provision for Firearms Businesses (Amnesty for Retail/Consignment Sales)**

An additional, separate amnesty applies to **businesses** that:

- On **December 31, 2002**, possessed a firearm that was:
   - **Unregistered**, or
   - **Deemed in law to be registered**,  
- And that operated as a **business authorized to sell firearms**, including **on consignment**,  
- And held a licence that authorized **retail sale of firearms** (including consignment sales).

#### **Purpose of the Amnesty**
To allow these businesses to **lawfully sell or dispose of** the unregistered or improperly registered firearm without being prosecuted under Part III of the Criminal Code.

#### **Amnesty Period**
- Begins: **January 1, 2003**  
- Ends: The **earliest of** the following dates:
   1. The day the business **sells** the firearm  
   2. The day the business **exports** the firearm (if applicable) — in compliance with all legal requirements, including destination country laws  
   3. The day the business **deactivates** the firearm so it is no longer a firearm  
   4. The day the business **turns in** the firearm to a police officer or firearms officer for destruction or disposal  
   5. **December 31, 2003**

> This creates a **strict deadline** (end of 2003) to dispose of the firearm, ensuring that the amnesty is temporary and not indefinite.
