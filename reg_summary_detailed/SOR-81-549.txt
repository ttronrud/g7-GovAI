**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Egg Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, revokes the previous **Manitoba Egg Order (C.R.C., c. 153)** and replaces it with a new, updated **Manitoba Egg Order**. The new Order establishes a modern regulatory framework for the marketing of eggs in Manitoba, aligning it with current agricultural market conditions and administrative efficiency.

The Order is enacted under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the government to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, including eggs, to ensure fair pricing, market stability, and equitable distribution among producers.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **1. Citation and Definitions**
- **Citation**: The Order may be cited as the *Manitoba Egg Order*.
- **Definitions**:
  - **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the regulation of egg marketing.
  - **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Act. This body is now the central authority responsible for overseeing egg marketing.
  - **Eggs**: Defined broadly as "any variety, grade or class of eggs of a domestic hen belonging to the species *Gallus Domesticus* produced in Manitoba." This ensures that only eggs produced within the province are subject to the Order.
  - **Plan**: Refers to any marketing plan established and amended over time under the Act. This Plan will guide how eggs are marketed, priced, and distributed, both locally and beyond.

#### **2. Authority of the Commodity Board**

The **Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board** is granted broad authority to regulate the marketing of eggs in **interprovincial and export trade**—that is, eggs sold outside Manitoba or to other provinces and international markets.

This authority includes the power to:
- Exercise **all or any powers** similar to those it holds for **local marketing within Manitoba**, including setting prices, managing supply, and regulating distribution.
- Perform these functions **with respect to persons and property located within Manitoba**.

**Important Limitation**:  
The Commodity Board **does not have authority** over powers exercised by the **Canadian Egg Marketing Agency (CEMA)** under the *Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act* and its related proclamation and agreement. This means that national-level marketing functions (such as national pricing or export agreements) remain outside the jurisdiction of the Manitoba Board.

#### **3. Levy and Charge Mechanism**

The Commodity Board is authorized to:
- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities involved in the **production or marketing of eggs** within Manitoba.
- **Classify producers into different groups** (e.g., small farms, large producers, cooperative groups).
- **Set different levies or charges** for each group, based on factors such as production volume, market share, or type of operation.

**Purpose of Levies**:
- To fund the **operation and administration** of the Commodity Board.
- To create **reserves** (funds set aside for future use).
- To **cover expenses and losses** arising from the sale or disposal of eggs (e.g., price drops, market fluctuations).
- To **equalize or adjust payments** among egg producers to ensure fair distribution of income from egg sales, especially during periods of market volatility.

This mechanism allows for financial stability and risk-sharing among producers, helping to mitigate the impact of market downturns and ensuring that producers receive a fair share of revenue.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Market Stability** | By regulating interprovincial and export trade, the Order helps prevent price volatility and ensures consistent supply and pricing. |
| **Producer Equity** | The levy system enables fair financial redistribution, especially during periods of low egg prices or market shocks. |
| **Administrative Efficiency** | Replacing the old Order with a modern, clearly defined framework improves transparency and accountability. |
| **Provincial Autonomy** | The Order ensures Manitoba retains control over its egg marketing policies, independent of federal oversight in areas not covered by CEMA. |

### **Legal and Structural Context**

- The Order operates under the **Natural Products Marketing Act**, which gives provinces the power to regulate the marketing of specific agricultural products.
- It replaces a previous Order (C.R.C., c. 153), which may have been outdated or less responsive to current market dynamics.
- The new Order strengthens the role of the **Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board** as a key player in both local and national egg supply chains.

### **Conclusion**

The **Manitoba Egg Order** represents a significant update to the province’s egg marketing regime. It empowers the Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board to effectively manage the interprovincial and export marketing of eggs, while ensuring financial sustainability through a tiered levy system. By providing mechanisms for price stability, risk mitigation, and equitable income distribution, the Order supports the long-term viability of Manitoba’s egg industry and protects the interests of producers in a competitive and dynamic market.

This regulation reflects a balance between **provincial self-governance** and **market-based efficiency**, ensuring that Manitoba’s egg producers can thrive both locally and beyond provincial borders.
