**Detailed Summary of the *Time Limits in Respect of Matters Before the Copyright Board Regulations* (S.C. 2018, c. 27, s. 295; R.S. c. C-42)**

---

### **Overview**

These regulations establish clear time limits for decisions by the **Copyright Board of Canada** regarding proposed tariffs, royalty rate determinations, and hearings related to copyright licensing matters. They are made under the authority of **paragraphs 66.91(2)(a)a and (d)a of the Copyright Act**, based on recommendations from the **Minister of Industry** and the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**.

The primary objective is to ensure **timely, predictable, and consistent decision-making** in the licensing of copyrighted works—particularly in the context of **collective management societies (e.g., music, literary, or performing rights organizations)**—by setting strict deadlines for approvals, hearings, and royalty rate determinations.

---

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Explanation**

---

#### **1. Decision on Approval of a Proposed Tariff (Section 2)**

The Copyright Board must decide whether to approve a proposed tariff under **subsection 70(1)** or **83(8)** of the Copyright Act within one of two timeframes:

- **If a hearing is held**:  
  The decision must be made within **12 months** from the **final day** set by the Board or a case manager for the submission of written or oral submissions.

- **If no hearing is held**:  
  The decision must be made **before the effective period of the proposed tariff begins**.

> This ensures that decisions are made in a timely manner, either during the hearing process or before the tariff takes effect.

---

#### **2. Exceptional Circumstances and Extensions (Section 6)**

- The Board or a case manager may **extend** the 12-month deadline (or other relevant periods) **only in exceptional circumstances**.
- Such extensions must:
  - Be clearly justified and documented.
  - Specify the **extended period** and the **exceptional circumstances** (e.g., unforeseen complexity, technical issues, or public interest).
- After an extension is granted:
  - The Board must **publish a public notice** of the extension in a manner it deems appropriate (e.g., official journal, website, press release).

> This provision maintains accountability and transparency while allowing flexibility in rare, complex cases.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: Extensions are **not permitted** under Section 6 for decisions under **Section 9 or 10** (see below), meaning those deadlines are **non-extendable**.

---

#### **3. Notification of Hearing Intent (Section 5)**

- Within **three months** of the Board publishing a proposed tariff (under **section 68.2** or **subsection 83(5)**), the Board must:
  - Notify the **collective society** that filed the tariff.
  - Notify any **person or entity** that has filed an objection to the tariff.
  - Inform them **whether a written or oral hearing will be held**.

> This ensures transparency and allows stakeholders to plan accordingly. It also provides a mechanism for parties to respond to potential hearings.

---

#### **4. Continuation of Pending Matters (Section 8)**

- All matters **pending before the Board on the date these regulations come into force** must be **continued under and in accordance with Sections 1 to 6**, provided that such continuation is consistent with those provisions.

> This ensures legal continuity and avoids disruption of ongoing cases.

---

#### **5. Emergency Notification for Pending Matters (Section 9)**

- If, on the day the regulations come into force:
  - The Board or case manager has **not yet notified** the collective society and any objectors about whether a hearing will occur,
  - And the **three-month period under Section 5 has expired**,
  
  → The Board must issue the notification **within two months** of the regulations coming into force.

> This prevents delays in informing stakeholders and ensures compliance with procedural timelines.

---

#### **6. Accelerated Decision if No Hearing Is Scheduled (Section 10)**

- If, on the day the regulations come into force:
  - The **effective period of the proposed tariff has already begun**, and
  - The Board or case manager **notifies** the collective society and objectors that **no hearing will be held**,

→ The Board must make a decision on **approval of the tariff** within **12 months** of the **day the regulations come into force**.

> This prevents indefinite delays in tariff implementation and ensures that tariffs that are not subject to hearings still receive timely review.

---

#### **7. Expedited Decision for Matters with Near-Term Hearings (Section 11)**

- If, on the day the regulations come into force:
  - The Board has **already held a hearing** on a matter, and
  - The 12-month deadline under Section 2 or 3 has **already ended or will end in less than six months**,

→ The Board must make the required decision **within six months** of the regulations coming into force.

> This provides a **faster resolution path** for cases that were already underway and are approaching their deadline, ensuring that the process does not stall.

---

#### **8. Non-Extensibility of Certain Deadlines (Section 10 – Final Note)**

> The timeframes set out in **Sections 9 and 10** (i.e., the 12-month and 6-month deadlines for decisions in specific circumstances) **cannot be extended** under Section 6.

> This reinforces the **finality and enforceability** of these deadlines, ensuring that decisions are made within strict, non-negotiable time limits.

---

### **Regulatory Timeline and Enforcement**

- **Effective Date**: The regulations come into force on the **day of registration** (not specified in the text, but typically published in the Canada Gazette).
- **Enforcement Mechanism**: The Board is required to comply with the deadlines, and failure to do so may result in procedural or administrative consequences, though no penalties are explicitly stated.

### **Key Principles Underlying the Regulations**

| Principle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Timeliness** | Ensures decisions are made promptly to avoid delays in licensing and royalty collection. |
| **Transparency** | Requires clear communication of hearing intentions and timelines to stakeholders. |
| **Predictability** | Sets fixed deadlines that parties can rely on when planning submissions or legal actions. |
| **Accountability** | Requires public notice of extensions and justifications for delays. |
| **Procedural Fairness** | Balances the need for hearings with the need for efficient resolution. |

### **Practical Implications for Stakeholders**

- **Collective Societies**:
  - Must monitor the 3-month notification period to know if a hearing will occur.
  - Must act promptly if a hearing is not scheduled to ensure timely tariff approval.

- **Rights Holders / Objection Filers**:
  - Have a clear window (3 months) to respond to proposed tariffs.
  - Can anticipate decisions within 12 months (or 6 months in urgent cases).

- **The Copyright Board**:
  - Must manage timelines rigorously.
  - Must publish notices of extensions publicly.
  - Cannot delay decisions beyond the specified timeframes (except in exceptional cases).

### **Conclusion**

These regulations serve as a **critical procedural framework** that enhances the **efficiency, fairness, and transparency** of the Copyright Board’s operations in managing proposed tariffs and royalty rates. By establishing clear, enforceable deadlines and ensuring timely communication, they help prevent bureaucratic delays and ensure that copyright licensing decisions are made in a timely and predictable manner—benefiting both rights holders and users of copyrighted works.

They represent a significant step toward modernizing the administrative process in Canadian copyright law, aligning it with contemporary expectations for efficiency and accountability in regulatory decision-making.

**Final Note**: These regulations are part of a broader effort to improve the governance of collective licensing in Canada and ensure that the Copyright Board operates with both legal rigor and responsiveness to the needs of stakeholders.
