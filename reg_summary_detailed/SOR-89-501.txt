Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the provided regulation, which revokes an older set of rules and introduces new restrictions on phosphorus concentration in cleaning products under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999):

## 📝 **Detailed Summary of the Phosphorus Concentration Control Regulations (S.C. 1988, c. 22)**

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**
- **Governing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.
- **Legal Basis**: The regulation is issued under **subsection 50(2)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999).
- **Purpose**: To **revise and replace** the outdated *Phosphorus Concentration Control Regulations, C.R.C., c. 393*, with updated, science-based limits on phosphorus content in household and commercial cleaning products.
- **Effective Date**: The new regulations come into force as of the publication in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (S.C. 1988, c. 22).

---

### **2. Exemption: Cleaning Products in Transit**
- **Section 117 of CEPA 1999 does not apply** to cleaning products that are:
  - In **transit through Canada**,
  - From a place **outside Canada** to another place **outside Canada**.
- This means that **phosphorus concentration limits do not apply** to products being transported internationally through Canada, as long as they are not intended for sale or use within Canada.

> ⚠️ *Note: This exemption applies only to transit; if a product is imported into Canada for sale or distribution, the phosphorus limits apply.*

---

### **3. Definition of Phosphorus for Regulatory Purposes**
- **Paragraph 118(1)(a)** of CEPA 1999 defines **phosphorus and its compounds** as **nutrients**.
- This classification is significant because:
  - Excess nutrients in waterways contribute to **eutrophication** (algal blooms, oxygen depletion, dead zones).
  - Phosphorus is a key driver of water pollution, especially in sensitive aquatic ecosystems.
  - Therefore, limiting phosphorus in detergents helps protect water quality and biodiversity.

### **4. Maximum Phosphorus Concentration Limits by Product Type**

| Product Type | Maximum Phosphorus Concentration |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Household Laundry Detergent** | **1.1% by weight as phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅)** <br> or **0.5% by weight as elemental phosphorus (P)** |
| **Commercial or Industrial Laundry Detergent** | **5% by weight as phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅)** <br> or **2.2% by weight as elemental phosphorus (P)** |
| **Household Dish-Washing Compound** | **1.1% by weight as phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅)** <br> or **0.5% by weight as elemental phosphorus (P)** |
| **Household Cleaners (excluding laundry detergents, dish-washing compounds, metal cleaners, or degreasing compounds)** | **1.1% by weight as phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅)** <br> or **0.5% by weight as elemental phosphorus (P)** |

> 🔍 **Key Observations**:
> - Household products (laundry, dishwashing, general cleaners) are subject to **stricter limits** (1.1% P₂O₅).
> - Commercial/industrial detergents have **higher allowable levels** (5% P₂O₅), reflecting differences in usage, wastewater treatment, and economic considerations.
> - The regulations use **two equivalent expressions** (P₂O₅ and elemental phosphorus) to ensure consistency and accuracy in product labeling and testing.

### **5. Requirements for Phosphorus Testing**
Any analysis to determine phosphorus concentration must be conducted by a laboratory that meets **one of the following accreditation standards**:

#### ✅ Option 1: ISO/IEC 17025 Accreditation
- The laboratory must be:
  - **Accredited** under **ISO/IEC 17025**, which sets general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories.
  - Accredited by an **accrediting body** that is a **signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA)**.
- The **scope of accreditation** must include phosphorus analysis.

#### ✅ Option 2: Environment Quality Act (CQLR, c. Q-2)
- The laboratory must be accredited under the **Quebec Environmental Quality Act** (CQLR, c. Q-2).
- Must have a scope of accreditation that includes phosphorus testing.

> 📌 **Purpose**: Ensures the accuracy, reliability, and traceability of phosphorus content data used to enforce compliance.

### **6. Recordkeeping Requirements for Manufacturers and Importers**

All entities that:
- Manufacture for use or sale in Canada, or
- Import cleaning products containing phosphorus,

**must maintain detailed records** for **five years** after the records are created.

#### A. For Manufacturers (Products Made in Canada)
Records must include:
1. Brand name of each product containing phosphorus.
2. Name and civic address of the manufacturer’s **principal place of business**.
3. Quantity of each product shipped from each manufacturing plant.
4. Name and civic address of each **recipient** (e.g., retailer, distributor) of the product.

#### B. For Importers
Records must include:
1. Brand name of each product containing phosphorus.
2. Name and civic address of the **importer’s principal place of business**.
3. **Port of entry** where the product entered Canada.
4. Name and civic address of the **sender** (manufacturer or exporter).
5. **Date of import**.
6. **Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HC) number** for the product.
7. **Importer number** for the shipment.

> 📂 **Storage Requirements**:
> - Records must be kept at the manufacturer’s or importer’s **principal place of business in Canada**.
> - If records are stored elsewhere, the person must **notify the Minister of the address** where they are kept.
> - The records must be **accessible for inspection** by the Minister or authorized officials.

> 🔍 **Purpose**: Enables traceability, accountability, and enforcement of compliance. Allows regulators to investigate potential violations or environmental impacts.

### **7. Key Environmental and Public Health Rationale**
- **Phosphorus pollution** leads to:
  - Eutrophication of lakes, rivers, and coastal waters.
  - Harmful algal blooms.
  - Oxygen depletion, fish kills, and loss of biodiversity.
- By limiting phosphorus in common household and commercial cleaning products, the regulation:
  - Reduces the risk of water pollution.
  - Protects aquatic ecosystems.
  - Promotes sustainable consumer products.
  - Aligns with broader environmental protection goals under CEPA 1999.

---

### **8. Regulatory Impact and Enforcement**
- The regulation is **enforceable** by the **Minister of the Environment**.
- Violations may result in:
  - Fines.
  - Product recalls.
  - Suspension of manufacturing or import privileges.
- The **Minister may inspect records** and require compliance reports.

## ✅ Summary in One Paragraph

The Canadian government has revoked the old *Phosphorus Concentration Control Regulations* and introduced new, stricter limits on phosphorus in cleaning products to protect water quality. Under the updated rules, household laundry detergents, dishwashing compounds, and general household cleaners must contain no more than **1.1% phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅)** or **0.5% elemental phosphorus (P)**. Commercial detergents are allowed up to **5% P₂O₅** or **2.2% elemental phosphorus**. All phosphorus testing must be conducted by an accredited laboratory meeting ISO/IEC 17025 or Quebec’s Environment Quality Act standards. Manufacturers and importers must maintain detailed records—including product details, shipping data, and importer information—for **five years**, which must be accessible for inspection. These measures are designed to reduce nutrient pollution in waterways, prevent eutrophication, and ensure environmental accountability throughout the supply chain.
