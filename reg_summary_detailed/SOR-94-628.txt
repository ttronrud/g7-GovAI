Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation you provided:

---

### **Regulatory Summary: Repeal of the Prince Edward Island Milk Order, 1988 and Introduction of the Prince Edward Island Milk Marketing Order, 2001**

#### **1. Legal Context and Authority**
- **Issuing Body**: His Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation**: Made on the advice of the **Minister of Agriculture**.
- **Legal Basis**: Pursuant to **subsections 2(1) and (2) of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**.
- **Purpose**: To **repeal** the outdated *Prince Edward Island Milk Order, 1988* (Order in Council P.C. 1988-1607), and to **replace it** with a modern, updated regulatory framework.

> This action reflects a shift from an outdated provincial milk marketing regime to a more flexible and economically sound system aligned with current agricultural and market conditions.

---

#### **2. Repeal and Replacement**
- The **Prince Edward Island Milk Order, 1988** is officially **repealed**.
- It is replaced by a **new Order** that grants authority to the **Prince Edward Island Milk Marketing Board (Board)** to regulate the **marketing of milk in interprovincial trade and for export**.
- The new Order is **annexed** to the regulation and forms the basis of the updated regulatory framework.

> This change ensures that milk marketing is governed by a more current, transparent, and economically efficient system that supports both producers and the broader dairy market.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions in the Order**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Prince Edward Island* — the enabling legislation that establishes the Board and authorizes its functions. |
| **Board** | The *Prince Edward Island Milk Marketing Board*, a statutory body created under the Act to manage milk marketing. |
| **Milk** | Defined as milk or cream from cows produced in Prince Edward Island, intended for **consumer use in liquid form within Canada**. Excludes non-consumer or non-liquid forms. |
| **Plan** | Any marketing plan established and amended over time under the Act. These plans guide how milk is marketed, priced, and distributed. |

> These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in how the Board operates and how milk is defined for regulatory purposes.

---

#### **4. Authority to Regulate Interprovincial and Export Trade**

- The Board is **authorized to regulate** the marketing of milk in:
  - **Interprovincial trade** (i.e., sale of milk to other Canadian provinces),
  - **Export trade** (i.e., sale of milk outside Canada).

- **Scope of Powers**:
  - The Board may exercise **all or any powers** it currently holds in relation to **local marketing of milk within Prince Edward Island**.
  - This includes powers such as setting prices, managing supply, and enforcing marketing standards — but only **within the context of interprovincial and export trade**.

> This provision ensures continuity in the Board’s regulatory capacity, allowing it to maintain control over pricing, quality, and market stability across markets.

---

#### **5. Exclusion of Canadian Dairy Commission Powers**

- The Board’s authority **does not include** any powers exercised by the **Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act* in relation to interprovincial milk marketing.

> This is a critical limitation. It clarifies that:
> - The CDC retains its **national mandate** and authority over certain aspects of interprovincial milk marketing (e.g., national pricing, quality standards, or market stabilization).
> - The Board operates **independently** in its provincial jurisdiction and does not overlap with or duplicate CDC functions.

> This avoids duplication and ensures a clear division of responsibilities between provincial and federal actors.

---

#### **6. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**

- The Board has the power to:
  - **Fix and impose levies or charges** on milk or its components (e.g., fat, protein).
  - **Classify producers or marketers** into different groups (e.g., small farms vs. large dairies).
  - **Set different levies or charges** for different groups based on production volume, scale, or other factors.

> This allows for **targeted and equitable cost recovery**, ensuring that smaller producers are not unfairly burdened.

---

#### **7. Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for the following purposes:

1. **Creation of reserves** (to stabilize prices during downturns),
2. **Payment of Board expenses** (operational costs),
3. **Reimbursement for losses** arising from the sale or disposal of milk (e.g., if prices fall below expected levels),
4. **Equalization or adjustment** of income among milk producers:
   - Ensures that producers who earn less due to market fluctuations receive financial support.
   - Helps achieve **economic fairness** and **market stability** across the province.

> This mechanism acts as a **risk-sharing and income-support tool**, helping to protect producers from market volatility.

---

#### **8. Status and Timeline**

- **Original Publication**: SOR/88-422, 1988 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 3625.
- **Repeal**: The Order was **repealed** by **SOR/2001-16, section 29**, on January 1, 2001.
- **Note**: Despite being repealed, the **new Order replacing the 1988 one** was likely implemented in 2001 as part of a broader reform of the province’s agricultural marketing system.

> This indicates that the 2001 Order was a **temporary or transitional measure** that may have been superseded by further reforms or replaced by a different regulatory framework over time.

### **Summary of Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Modernize milk marketing regulation** | Replaces outdated 1988 order with a more flexible, market-responsive framework. |
| **Strengthen provincial control** | Empowers the PEI Milk Marketing Board to manage interprovincial and export marketing. |
| **Ensure fairness among producers** | Uses levies to equalize income and support producers during market downturns. |
| **Avoid duplication with federal authority** | Clearly delineates the Board’s role from that of the Canadian Dairy Commission. |
| **Support economic stability** | Enables the Board to manage price volatility and create financial buffers. |

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **significant reform** in Prince Edward Island’s dairy marketing system. By repealing the 1988 milk order and introducing a new framework, the government aimed to:

- Improve market efficiency,
- Enhance producer equity,
- Align provincial marketing practices with evolving market dynamics,
- And clearly define the boundaries between provincial and federal regulatory roles.

While the Order itself was **repealed in 2001**, it served as a **critical transitional step** in the evolution of PEI’s agricultural marketing policy and laid the groundwork for future reforms in the dairy sector.

---

> **Note**: For current regulatory status, further review of the *Natural Products Marketing Act* and any subsequent amendments or replacement legislation (e.g., under the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* or updated provincial acts) is recommended, as this 2001 Order is no longer in force.
