### **Detailed Summary of the Gilbert Bay Marine Protected Area Regulations (S.C. 1996, c. 31)**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Oceans Act* and pursuant to the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, establish the **Gilbert Bay Marine Protected Area (MPA)** in Newfoundland and Labrador. The regulations define the boundaries of the protected area, set out prohibited and permitted activities, and establish a framework for scientific and educational activities, with strict environmental safeguards.

---

## **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulations are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**.
- This provision allows the government to designate marine protected areas to conserve marine ecosystems and biodiversity.

## **2. Key Definitions**
The following terms are defined for clarity and consistency throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Area** | Refers to the Gilbert Bay Marine Protected Area as designated under Section 2. It is a specific zone of marine waters subject to conservation rules. |
| **Vessel** | Defined as per Section 2 of the *Canada Shipping Act*, meaning any ship, boat, or floating structure used for transport or operation on navigable waters. |
| **Waters** | Includes the seabed and subsoil below the water surface to a depth of **two metres**. This ensures that both surface and near-bottom ecological features are protected. |
| **Geographic Coordinates** | All coordinates are expressed in the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD 83)** geodetic reference system, ensuring accuracy and consistency in mapping. |
| **Rhumb Lines** | Used in the schedule to define boundaries. A rhumb line is a path of constant bearing (direction) across the Earth’s surface; these are used instead of great circles to simplify boundary drawing. |

## **3. Geographic Boundaries of the Gilbert Bay MPA**
The protected area is composed of four distinct management zones (Zones 1A, 1B, 2, and 3), each defined by rhumb lines intersecting with the **low-water line of the bay**. The low-water line marks the natural edge of the bay at mean low tide.

### **Zone 1A**
- Located generally **northwest** of a rhumb line connecting:
  - 52°38′56″N, 55°59′28″W  
  - 52°37′43″N, 55°59′36″W  
- Bounded by the **low-water line** of the bay and the rhumb line to its points of intersection with that line.

### **Zone 1B**
- Located generally **southwest** of a rhumb line connecting:
  - 52°37′00″N, 55°58′07″W  
  - 52°36′49″N, 55°57′45″W  
- Also bounded by the **low-water line** and the rhumb line to its intersection points.

### **Zone 2**
- Bounded by the low-water line and three rhumb lines:
  1. Between 52°38′56″N, 55°59′28″W and 52°37′43″N, 55°59′36″W  
  2. Between 52°37′00″N, 55°58′07″W and 52°36′49″N, 55°57′45″W  
  3. Between 52°36′16″N, 55°52′19″W and 52°35′38″N, 55°52′20″W  

### **Zone 3**
- Bounded by the low-water line and four rhumb lines:
  1. Between 52°36′16″N, 55°52′19″W and 52°35′38″N, 55°52′20″W  
  2. Between 52°36′17″N, 55°48′59″W and 52°36′09″N, 55°48′59″W  
  3. Between 52°33′17″N, 55°46′27″W and 52°32′59″N, 55°46′58″W  
  4. Between 52°33′25″N, 55°54′19″W and 52°33′01″N, 55°53′31″W  

> These zones collectively form a protected marine area designed to conserve biodiversity and sensitive marine habitats.

---

## **4. Prohibited Activities**
No person may:
- **Disturb, damage, destroy, or remove** any living marine organism or any part of its habitat within the Area.
- **Deposit, discharge, or dump** any substance (including waste, fuel, chemicals, or debris) in a way that could lead to such disturbance or damage.

> This prohibition applies to all forms of human activity that could negatively impact marine life or ecosystems.

---

## **5. Exceptions to Prohibited Activities**
Despite the general ban, certain activities are **permitted** under specific conditions:

### **Fishing Activities**
- **Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences**: Fishing allowed under existing Aboriginal fishing rights.
- **Seal Fishing**: Permitted under the *Marine Mammal Regulations*, including related activities.
- **Recreational Fishing**:
  - **Zone 1A or 1B**: Angling for **Arctic char, salmon, or trout**.
  - **Zone 2**: Fishing for **any species except Atlantic cod**.
  - **Zone 3**: Fishing for **any species**.
- **Commercial Fishing**:
  - In **Zone 2 or 3**, for any species **other than Atlantic cod**, provided it is conducted under the *Atlantic Fishery Regulations, 1985* or the *Newfoundland and Labrador Fishery Regulations*.

> Note: Fishing for Atlantic cod is **prohibited** in all zones.

### **Infrastructure Maintenance and Construction**
- **Zone 1A or 1B**: Maintenance, repair, or removal of **wharfs**.
- **Zone 2**: Construction, maintenance, repair, or removal of **wharfs**.
- **Zone 3**: Construction, maintenance, repair, removal of **wharfs, causeways, or bridges**.
