2. **Purpose of the Designation:**  
   This designation establishes the NCR as the central administrative and operational hub for the NRT. It provides a clear, official location for the table’s leadership, meetings, coordination, and public engagement activities. The location ensures proximity to federal government institutions, key stakeholders, and decision-makers, facilitating effective collaboration between environmental, economic, and Indigenous communities.

3. **Legal Basis and Process:**  
   - The regulation is enacted pursuant to **Section 14** of the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy Act, which empowers the federal government to designate a location for the NRT’s principal office.  
   - The Governor General acts on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, indicating that the decision is a political and policy-level choice reflecting national priorities and administrative efficiency.

4. **Implications and Significance:**  
   - **Administrative Efficiency:** Placing the principal office in the National Capital Region ensures accessibility to federal departments, such as Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and Indigenous Services Canada, which are key partners in the NRT’s work.  
   - **Symbolic and Practical Role:** The NCR serves as a neutral, central location that promotes inclusivity and national representation in environmental and economic decision-making.  
   - **Strengthening Inter-Governmental Collaboration:** The designation supports the NRT’s mandate to bring together federal, provincial, territorial, Indigenous, and municipal governments, as well as private sector and civil society, to balance environmental protection with economic development.
