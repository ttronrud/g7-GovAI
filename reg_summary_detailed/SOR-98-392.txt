**Detailed Summary of the Northwest Territories Rules of Practice Respecting Applications and Hearings Concerning a Reduction in the Number of Years of Imprisonment Without Eligibility for Parole**

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These Rules were established by the **Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories** under **subsection 745.64(1)a of the Criminal Code (S.C. 1996, c. 34, s. 2(2))**.  
They provide a detailed procedural framework for individuals who are currently serving a sentence for a criminal offence and seek a **reduction in the number of years of imprisonment**, specifically in cases where the offender is **not eligible for parole** during the period of incarceration.

This process allows an applicant to apply for a **reduction in their sentence** based on new evidence, changes in circumstances, or other grounds, even if they are not yet eligible for parole — a unique feature under the Criminal Code.
