**Detailed Summary of the General Preferential Tariff Withdrawal and Extension (2023 GPT Review) Order**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**
This regulation, formally titled the *General Preferential Tariff Withdrawal and Extension (2023 GPT Review) Order*, is issued under the authority of the Governor in Council (the Canadian federal government’s executive body) based on a recommendation from the Minister of Finance. Its primary purpose is to adjust the eligibility of certain countries for the **General Preferential Tariff (GPT)** — a trade benefit that allows goods originating in eligible countries to enter Canada with reduced or zero tariffs.

The decision reflects a strategic review of global trade relationships and economic status, particularly concerning the development status of countries. The Governor in Council determines that **Lebanon and Tunisia are developing countries**, which qualifies them for continued eligibility under the GPT regime. Conversely, the regulation removes GPT benefits for several other countries deemed not to meet the criteria for preferential treatment.

### **2. Legal Authority**
The Order is made under the following provisions of Canadian law:
- **Section 118 of the Customs Tariff Act (S.C. 2011, c. 24)**  
  This section empowers the Governor in Council to establish, modify, or withdraw preferential tariff treatment for goods originating in specific countries.
- **Section 118 of the Customs Tariff Act (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**  
  This provision supports the authority to make tariff adjustments based on economic and trade considerations.

These legal foundations ensure that the Order is grounded in established federal trade policy and customs legislation.

### **3. Key Provisions**

#### **A. Withdrawal of General Preferential Tariff Benefits**
The entitlement to the benefit of the General Preferential Tariff is **withdrawn** for goods originating in the following countries:
- Armenia  
- Belize  
- British Virgin Islands  
- Fiji  
- Georgia  
- Guatemala  
- Guyana  
- Iraq  
- Marshall Islands  
- Moldova  
- Nauru  
- Paraguay  
- Tonga  
- Turkmenistan  
- Tuvalu  
- Vietnam  

👉 *This means that goods originating in these countries will no longer be eligible for reduced or zero tariffs upon entry into Canada, and will be subject to standard tariff rates unless otherwise exempted.*

> **Note:** This withdrawal applies to all goods originating in these countries, regardless of product type or value.

#### **B. Extension of General Preferential Tariff Benefits**
The entitlement to the General Preferential Tariff is **extended** to goods originating in:
- **Lebanon**  
- **Tunisia**

👉 *These two countries are now recognized as developing nations under Canada’s trade policy framework and are granted continued access to preferential tariff treatment under the GPT regime.*

> The extension is based on the Governor in Council’s determination that Lebanon and Tunisia meet the criteria for developing country status, which includes factors such as income level, economic structure, and capacity for trade development.

#### **C. Exception for Transit Goods**
Section 1 of the Order **does not apply** to goods that were:
- **In transit to Canada**  
- **Before January 1, 2025**

👉 This means that goods that were already in transit to Canada prior to the effective date of the Order (January 1, 2025) will continue to benefit from the GPT status they had at the time of transit. This provision ensures continuity and avoids disruption to existing shipments.

---

### **4. Effective Date**
The Order comes into force on **January 1, 2025**.

👉 All changes — both the withdrawal and extension of GPT benefits — will take effect on this date. Canadian customs authorities will begin enforcing the new tariff regime from this point forward.

### **5. Implications and Significance**

- **Trade Policy Shift**: The Order reflects Canada’s evolving trade policy, emphasizing support for countries classified as developing, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa (Lebanon and Tunisia), while adjusting preferences for others due to economic or strategic considerations.

- **Impact on Importers and Exporters**:
  - Importers from the withdrawn countries (e.g., Vietnam, Iraq, Tuvalu) may face higher tariffs on goods entering Canada.
  - Exporters from Lebanon and Tunisia may benefit from lower or zero tariffs, improving market access and competitiveness in Canada.

- **Economic Rationale**: The decision is based on the principle that preferential treatment should be granted to countries that are economically developing and may benefit from increased trade integration. The removal of GPT for some nations may be due to concerns about trade imbalances, economic stability, or alignment with broader international trade agreements.

- **Transparency and Stability**: The exception for goods in transit ensures that existing trade flows are not disrupted, maintaining stability in supply chains during the transition period.

### **6. Amendments and Future Review**
This Order is part of an ongoing review process of the General Preferential Tariff regime. While no immediate amendments are listed in the provided text, the structure suggests that future reviews may be conducted to reassess the development status of countries or adjust tariff eligibility based on new economic data.

### **Conclusion**
The *General Preferential Tariff Withdrawal and Extension (2023 GPT Review) Order* is a targeted adjustment to Canada’s preferential trade policy. It:
- **Withdraws GPT benefits** for 17 countries (including several in the Global South and in vulnerable economic situations),
