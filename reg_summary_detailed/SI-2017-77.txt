### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a pivotal step in Canada’s effort to reform federal Indigenous services.

This structural change underscores a growing recognition that Indigenous peoples’ needs in health, education, and social development must be addressed through a **culturally grounded, community-led, and integrated approach**—a model now formally institutionalized within the federal public service.
