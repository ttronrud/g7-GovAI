**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **authorize Nordion International Inc.**—a corporation incorporated under the *Canada Business Corporations Act*—to establish **five wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries** in key European countries. These subsidiaries will be created to facilitate the **sales and distribution of Nordion International Inc.’s products** in those respective jurisdictions.

The strategic intent appears to be enhancing market access and operational efficiency in Europe, where Nordion’s products (likely related to nuclear science, radiation detection, or medical isotopes) are in demand.

**3. Scope of Authorization**  
The Order authorizes Nordion International Inc. to incorporate the following five corporations, each under the laws of a specific European country:

| Country | Jurisdiction |
|--------|--------------|
| Netherlands | Incorporation under Dutch law |
| France | Incorporation under French law |
| United Kingdom | Incorporation under UK law |
| Italy | Incorporation under Italian law |
| Federal Republic of Germany | Incorporation under German law |

Each of these corporations will be **fully owned** by, or held on behalf of, Nordion International Inc. The ownership structure is clearly defined as follows:

- **All shares** in each newly incorporated company will be:
  - **Held by** Nordion International Inc., or
  - **Held on behalf of** Nordion International Inc., or
  - **Held in trust for** Nordion International Inc.

This ensures that Nordion maintains **full control and ownership** of the foreign entities, with no independent or third-party ownership interests.

**4. Purpose of the Foreign Incorporations**  
The incorporation of these entities is **specifically for the purpose of sales and distribution** of Nordion’s products in the respective countries listed. This implies:
