**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Authorization for Sale of Steam from Crown’s Central Heating Plant to Takhini Recreation Centre

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council  
On the recommendation of:  
- The Minister of Public Works  
- The Treasury Board  

**Purpose:**  
This regulation authorizes the Minister of Public Works to enter into and execute a formal agreement on behalf of the Crown for the sale of steam generated by the Crown-owned Central Heating Plant located at 202 Range Road, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Subject Matter of the Agreement:**  
   The agreement involves the sale of steam produced by the Crown’s Central Heating Plant. The plant is situated at 202 Range Road in the City of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory.

2. **Recipient of Steam:**  
   The buyer of the steam is the Takhini Recreation Centre, which is also located in the City of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory.

3. **Legal Authority for Execution:**  
   The Minister of Public Works is empowered to execute the agreement on behalf of the Crown. This authority is derived from the Government of Canada’s administrative structure and is consistent with established practices in public sector procurement and service provision.

4. **Financial Authority (Key Provision):**  
   Pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, the Minister of Public Works is authorized to:  
   - Issue a regulatory order  
   - To prescribe the fees or charges that the Takhini Recreation Centre must pay to the Crown for the steam it receives under the agreement.  

   This provision allows the Crown to establish a clear, legally binding financial framework for the transaction, ensuring that the cost of providing the steam is appropriately recovered.

5. **Nature of the Transaction:**  
   The transaction is not a transfer of ownership but a commercial arrangement whereby the Crown provides a utility service (steam) to a public institution (the Takhini Recreation Centre), which in turn agrees to pay a fee or charge for its use.

6. **Legal and Financial Implications:**  
   - The authorization ensures that the Crown retains control over the operation and cost structure of its heating infrastructure.  
   - The prescribed fees will be subject to the oversight of the Treasury Board and are consistent with public finance and accountability principles.  
   - The fees will likely cover operational costs, maintenance, and potential capital expenditures related to the steam production.

7. **Scope and Duration (Implied):**  
   While not explicitly stated in the regulation, such agreements are typically governed by a defined term and may include conditions for renewal, performance standards, or adjustments to fees based on inflation or operational changes. These terms would be set in the actual agreement and may be subject to future review.

**Significance:**  
This regulation facilitates a practical and cost-effective arrangement whereby a public recreation facility can access essential heating services from a Crown-owned infrastructure. It also ensures that the government recovers reasonable costs for the provision of public services through a transparent and legally grounded fee structure.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a formal administrative step that enables the Crown to commercialize a public utility service (steam production) in a way that supports both operational sustainability and equitable access to services. It reflects a balance between public service delivery and financial accountability, grounded in statutory authority under the Financial Administration Act.
