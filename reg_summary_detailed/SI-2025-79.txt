**Regulation Summary:**

**Title of the Regulation:**  
Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat

**Legal Basis:**  
- **Act:** *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*  
- **Section Reference:** Section 207 of the Act (as amended in S.C. 2003, c. 22)  
- **Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  
- **Provisional Basis:** Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act  

**Key Content of the Regulation:**  
The Governor General in Council, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, transfers from the **Minister for International Trade** to the **President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada** the **control and supervision** of the portion of the federal public administration known as the **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS)**.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   This is not a change in the operational function of the secretariat, but a formal reassignment of **administrative oversight and control**. The transfer involves shifting responsibility for governance, policy direction, staffing, budgetary oversight, and administrative management of the CICS from the Minister for International Trade to the President of the King’s Privy Council.

2. **Role of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS):**  
   The CICS is a federal agency or administrative unit established to support the coordination and facilitation of intergovernmental relations between the federal government and provincial and territorial governments. Its responsibilities typically include:
   - Facilitating dialogue and policy development on shared issues (e.g., health, education, environment, infrastructure)
   - Supporting the implementation of intergovernmental agreements
   - Providing administrative and logistical support to intergovernmental meetings and conferences
   - Acting as a central coordination body for federal-provincial-territorial cooperation

3. **Why the Transfer Matters:**  
   - The transfer from the Minister for International Trade to the President of the Privy Council reflects a strategic decision to **centralize intergovernmental coordination under a higher-level, cross-departmental authority**.  
   - The President of the King’s Privy Council is a senior constitutional figure who oversees the work of the Cabinet and the federal executive branch. Placing the CICS under their supervision ensures that intergovernmental affairs are aligned with broader government priorities and are subject to high-level political oversight.  
   - It may also signal a shift in policy emphasis, recognizing that intergovernmental relations are not solely a matter of trade or economic policy, but a core function of federal governance.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which permits the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign duties and control of public service entities. This provision allows for administrative reorganization to improve efficiency, accountability, or effectiveness.

5. **Effective Date and Implementation:**  
   While the regulation itself is dated as part of *S.C. 2003, c. 22* (Statutes of Canada 2003, Chapter 22), the specific implementation of the transfer would have been carried out in accordance with the procedures of the Public Service Act and the administrative structure of the federal government. The actual operational changes would have been implemented upon publication and would have required coordination between departments and agencies.

6. **Relevance to Public Service Governance:**  
   This transfer exemplifies how federal public administration can be restructured to better serve intergovernmental cooperation. It underscores the importance of institutional coordination in federalism and demonstrates the flexibility of the Canadian public service framework in responding to evolving governance needs.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization in which the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat is moved from the jurisdiction of the Minister for International Trade to the President of the King’s Privy Council. The change enhances the political oversight and strategic alignment of intergovernmental affairs within the federal government, reinforcing the role of central coordination in Canada’s federal structure.
