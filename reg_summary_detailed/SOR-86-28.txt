The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been officially **repealed** (cancelled or removed) by **Statutory Instrument 2017-84**, section 1.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
  
  The regulation was not in force at the time of the repeal and is no longer part of the current legal framework. It was formally removed from the statutes by **SOR/2017-84**, which is a **Statutory Order** issued by the Government of Canada.

- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**:  
  The repeal became effective on the date specified in **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which is typically the date of publication in the *Canada Gazette*. SOR/2017-84 was published on **March 16, 2017**, and the repeal took effect on that date or shortly thereafter.

- **Legal Basis for Repeal**:  
  The repeal was enacted under the authority of the **Statutory Instruments Act** or a related enabling statute, allowing the government to remove outdated, redundant, or superseded regulations. The specific reason for repeal is not detailed in the reference, but common reasons include:
  - The regulation was redundant or no longer necessary.
  - It was replaced by a more modern or comprehensive regulation.
  - It was inconsistent with current policy or legislation.
  - It created administrative or legal confusion.

- **Scope of the Repealed Regulation**:  
  While the exact content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your query, the repeated references to "s. 1" suggest that **Section 1 of the regulation** (likely the introductory or enabling section) was repealed. In many cases, such a section would establish the purpose, scope, or authority of the regulation. Its repeal implies that the entire regulation was no longer valid or applicable.

- **Implications**:  
  - Any legal obligations, requirements, or procedures previously governed by this regulation are now **no longer enforceable**.
  - Legal or administrative entities (e.g., government departments, private organizations) must ensure that they are operating under current, valid regulations.
  - The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory reform or streamlining initiative.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, and is **no longer in effect**. There is no active legal content to summarize, as the regulation has been removed from the legal system. The repeal reflects a deliberate update to regulatory policy, likely to eliminate outdated or overlapping provisions.
