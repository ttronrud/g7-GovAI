**Detailed Summary of the *Persons Authorized to Account for Casual Goods Regulations***

### **Overview**

The *Persons Authorized to Account for Casual Goods Regulations* (the "Regulations") are a set of administrative rules established under the *Customs Act* (the "Act") to define and regulate the conditions under which certain individuals or entities—specifically, **couriers**—may be authorized to account for **casual goods** when those goods are released into Canada in lieu of the importer or owner of the goods.

These Regulations implement a public announcement made on **April 5, 1993**, and provide a legal framework for allowing commercial carriers (couriers) to act as accountable parties for the importation and handling of non-commercial goods, thereby streamlining customs procedures in specific circumstances.

### **Key Legal Basis and Authority**

The Regulations are made under several provisions of the *Customs Act*, including:

- **Paragraphs 164(4)(a.2)** and **167.1(b)** – These authorize the regulation of persons who account for goods released in place of an importer or owner.
- **Subsection 32(4)** – Allows for the release of goods in lieu of the importer or owner, typically when the importer is absent or unable to act.
- **Subsection 2(1)** – Defines the term *courier* as a commercial carrier engaged in scheduled international transportation of goods (excluding mail).
- **Subsection 32(6)(a)** – Specifies that a courier may account for goods under certain conditions.
- **Subsection 40(3)** – Requires record-keeping obligations for authorized persons.
- **Paragraphs 164(1)(h.1) and (i)** – Relate to the authority of the Minister to regulate persons acting on behalf of importers.
- **Subsection 164(1.1)** – Provides additional regulatory power in relation to customs operations.

The Governor in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, issued these Regulations to give effect to the public announcement of April 5, 1993, and to operationalize the rights and responsibilities of couriers in accounting for casual goods.

2. **Ensure Accountability**: By requiring formal authorization, security, and record-keeping, the Regulations ensure that all actions taken by couriers are traceable and compliant with customs laws.
3. **Promote Efficiency**: Reduces delays in customs clearance for goods that are not intended for commercial use or sale.
4. **Protect the Integrity of the Customs System**: Prevents fraud, misrepresentation, and unauthorized handling of goods through strict eligibility, monitoring, and revocation mechanisms.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Casual goods** are non-commercial imports; they are not intended for sale or business use.
- Only **bonded couriers** can act as accountants for such goods.
- Authorization is **conditional** and requires proof of bonding and security.
- The process is **transparent**, with a 90-day notice and opportunity to respond before revocation.
- **Six years of record-keeping** is mandatory, with flexibility in format (microfilm or digital, if properly supported).
- The system is designed to balance **operational flexibility** with **customs compliance and accountability**.

### **Conclusion**

The *Persons Authorized to Account for Casual Goods Regulations* establish a clear, structured, and legally sound framework for allowing commercial carriers to act on behalf of importers in the case of non-commercial goods.

This regulatory framework reflects a practical response to real-world import challenges and supports the broader goals of the *Customs Act* to maintain border integrity while enabling legitimate trade
