## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001**

### 📌 **Overview**
The *Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001* (R.S., c. 24 (3rd Supp.), s. 1) are a set of detailed safety regulations designed to protect consumers from the risks associated with hazardous chemical products and their containers. These regulations establish standardized requirements for:
- Hazard classification,
- Labeling and information display,
- Container design and safety features (e.g., child resistance),
- Testing procedures,
- Data sources for hazard evaluation,
- Compliance and recordkeeping.

They apply to **consumer products** that pose risks such as toxicity, flammability, corrosiveness, or skin-bonding adhesiveness — but **exclude** certain common household items like lighters, fuel containers attached to engines, or portable petroleum containers meeting specific safety standards.

> **Important Note**: These regulations **do not apply to vaping products**, as defined in the *Tobacco and Vaping Products Act*.

## 📚 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Chemical Product** | A product used by consumers with hazardous properties (toxic, corrosive, flammable, or quick skin-bonding adhesive). Excludes products where exposure is not reasonably foreseeable, or those like lighters, fuel tanks, or containers meeting CSA/ULC standards. |
| **Hazard Category** | A broad classification system: <br>• Category 1: Toxic<br>• Category 2: Corrosive<br>• Category 3: Flammable<br>• Category 4: Quick skin-bonding adhesive<br>• Category 5: Pressurized containers |
| **Sub-category** | More specific hazard level within a category (e.g., "very toxic," "spontaneously combustible"). Products may fall into multiple sub-categories, especially if different exposure risks exist. |
| **Hazardous Ingredient** | Any ingredient present at ≥1% concentration that the supplier reasonably believes may harm humans, has unknown toxicological properties, or arises from chemical reactions not fully understood. Includes pure chemicals and complex mixtures. |
| **Complex Mixture** | A substance derived from natural origins (e.g., plant fractions), physically separated, or chemically modified from such sources. Not a trade name. |
| **Container** | Any container (pressurized or otherwise) intended for storage or dispensing of a chemical product by consumers — including empty containers destined for consumer use. |
| **Display Surface** | The visible surface of the container where labeling is required; excludes bottom, seams, or concave/convex areas near top/bottom. |
| **Main Display Panel** | The largest visible area of the display surface under normal sale conditions. Determined by container shape (e.g., largest side of rectangular, top or 40% of lateral surface for cylinders). |
| **Responsible Person** | The **manufacturer** (if produced in Canada) or the **importer** (if imported). Responsible for hazard assessment, labeling, and compliance. |
| **Good Scientific Practices** | Standards aligned with OECD guidelines: <br>• Test data development (OECD Test Guidelines)<br>• Laboratory practices (OECD GLP)<br>• Human experience data (peer-reviewed clinical cases) |
| **Human Experience Data** | Evidence (peer-reviewed) showing injury or poisoning from exposure or foreseeable use, including accidental consumption by children. |
| **Flash Point** | Minimum temperature at which a substance gives off flammable vapors. |
| **Flame Projection** | Flame length when a spray container is ignited. >15 cm or flashback indicates high flammability. |
| **Flashback** | Flame that travels back toward the spray container during ignition test. |
| **Aspiration** | Entry of chemicals into the trachea or lower respiratory system via mouth/nose or vomiting. |
| **Fumes / Mist / Vapour** | Airborne substances: fumes (condensed solids), mist (liquid droplets), vapours (gaseous form of solids/liquids). |
| **Acid/Alkali Reserve** | Measures acidity (acid reserve = grams of NaOH to reach pH 4.00) or alkalinity (alkali reserve = grams of NaOH neutralized to reach pH 10.00). Used to assess corrosive potential. |
| **Normal Atmospheric Pressure** | 101.324 kPa at 20°C. |
| **Official Languages** | English and French. All required information must be in both languages. |
| **Single-Use Container** | Non-reclosable container where all contents are used immediately after opening. |
| **Child-Resistant Container** | Must require tools (not supplied) to open; must maintain resistance throughout product life. |

## 🚨 Hazard Classification & Evaluation

### 1. **Hazard Determination Process**
The responsible person must:
- Determine the **hazard categories** and **sub-categories** of the chemical product or container.
- Identify the **required container type**.
- Determine the **required labeling and information** to be displayed.

> 🔍 **Multiple Hazards**: If a product falls into more than one hazard category, **all required information must be displayed** on the container.

> ⚠️ **Sub-category Priority**: If a product falls into multiple sub-categories within one category (e.g., "spontaneously combustible" and "flammable"), it **must be classified in all** — not just the most severe.

> 🚨 **Multiple Exposure Routes**: If exposure can occur via multiple routes (e.g., ingestion, inhalation), **information must be provided for each route**.

### 2. **Data Sources for Hazard Assessment (in order of precedence)**

| Source | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. **Human Experience Data** | Peer-reviewed data showing actual injuries or poisonings (especially child exposure). |
| 2. **OECD Test Guidelines** | Peer-reviewed, standardized animal or in vitro testing (e.g., LD50, LC50). |
| 3. **Tests under these Regulations** | If OECD tests were not done, then tests conducted per these regulations. |
| 4. **National or International Standards** | Recognized standards (e.g., ISO, CSA) that meet good scientific practices. |
| 5. **Generally Accepted Procedures** | Methods following good scientific practices at time of testing. |
| 6. **Similar Products** | Data on products with similar properties (e.g., structure, use, ingredients). |
| 7. **Other Peer-Reviewed Information** | Current scientific literature on the product or its ingredients. |
| 8. **Product-Specific Testing** | Tests conducted by the responsible person using good scientific practices (if no other data available). |

> ✅ **Preference Rules**:
> - Original literature > secondary references.
> - Data showing **greatest hazard** takes precedence.

## 📝 Labeling & Information Requirements

### 1. **Primary Hazard Statement (Single-Use Containers)**
All **single-use containers** must display:
> **"USE ENTIRE CONTENTS ON OPENING."**  
> **"UTILISER LA TOTALITÉ DU CONTENU APRÈS OUVERTURE."**

This is a mandatory safety instruction to prevent partial use and accidental exposure.

### 2. **First Aid Statement**
Must include:
- A list of **hazardous ingredients** (with concentrations ≥1%).
- A **first aid treatment** for exposure via ingestion, absorption, or inhalation.
- Helpful information for someone assisting the victim.

> ⚠️ Must be clearly legible and in both official languages.

### 3. **Hazard Symbol (Pictogram)**
- Must display a **standardized pictogram** (as per Schedule 2).
- The pictogram includes a **frame** and a **symbol** representing the hazard (e.g., skull for toxicity, flame for flammability).

> Example: A skull and crossbones for toxic products; flame for flammable products.

### 4. **Display Requirements**
- **Main Display Panel**: The largest visible area of the container (as defined by shape).
- **Display Surface**: The full surface where labels are placed — but excludes bottom, seams, and edges near top/bottom.

> All required information (hazard symbol, first aid, hazard category, etc.) must be visible on the **main display panel**.

## 🔒 Child-Resistant Container Requirements

### 1. **Design Requirements**
A child-resistant container must:
- Be opened **only** by using a tool (e.g., screwdriver, knife) not supplied with the product;
- Or meet one of the following international standards:
  - **CSA-Z76.1** (Canada)
  - **ISO 8317** (International)
  - **16 CFR 1700.20** (U.S.)

> ✅ The container must **maintain** its child-resistant properties throughout the product’s useful life.

### 2. **Performance Testing**
The responsible person must evaluate:
- **Compatibility** between the chemical product and the container (to ensure no degradation or failure of child resistance).
- **Physical wear and stress** (e.g., repeated opening/closing).
- **Force required** to open and close — must remain within
