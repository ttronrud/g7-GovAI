### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This authority is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**. This provision empowers the government to designate certain lands for inclusion in a land sale, particularly when those lands are located in proximity to water bodies or are subject to specific administrative or regulatory considerations.

**2. Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this order is to **include a specific parcel of land** in a broader land sale. Specifically, it designates that **all land described in the attached schedule**—which lies within **30.48 metres (100 feet) of the Ordinary High Water Mark of Great Slave Lake**—shall be included in the sale of the said lands.

- **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM):** This is a legally defined benchmark used in land surveys and land rights determinations. It refers to the highest point to which water regularly rises during normal conditions (not during floods or exceptional weather). Lands within 100 feet of this mark are often subject to special rules due to their proximity to a body of water, including potential impacts from flooding, erosion, or water-related access rights.

- The inclusion of land within this 100-foot buffer zone is significant because such areas may be subject to unique land use, ownership, or environmental regulations, and their inclusion in a sale may require special consideration or public notice.

**3. Specific Land Description:**  
The regulation refers to a specific parcel of land identified as:

- **Log Number 554**  
- Within **Group Number 814**  
- Located in **Hay River, Northwest Territories**

This parcel is formally described in a **survey plan of record**, which is:

- **Survey Record Number 50535**  
- Held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**  
- A copy of this plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District** in **Yellowknife**, under reference number **247**

This documentation ensures that the land description is officially recorded, legally verifiable, and accessible for public and administrative purposes.

**4. Legal and Administrative Significance:**  
- This order serves as a formal administrative directive to **include the specified land in a land sale process**.  
- By referencing the Territorial Lands Act, the government is asserting jurisdiction over the land and ensuring that the inclusion is legally sound and procedurally compliant.  
- The inclusion of land within 100 feet of Great Slave Lake may have implications for **water access rights, environmental protection, Indigenous rights, or land use planning**, especially given the proximity to a major lake in a northern region.

**5. Implications and Considerations:**  
- **Landowners or stakeholders** may need to be notified, particularly if the land is held by Indigenous communities or has cultural, ecological, or economic significance.  
- The sale of land adjacent to a large lake like Great Slave Lake may involve environmental assessments, flood risk evaluations, or consultation with Indigenous peoples, depending on the context of the broader land sale.  
- The reference to a formal survey plan and land registration record ensures transparency and legal clarity in the transaction.

### **Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally designates a specific parcel of land—Log 554, Group 814, Hay River, NWT—along with all land within 100 feet of the Ordinary High Water Mark of Great Slave Lake—as part of a land sale. The order is grounded in statutory authority under the Territorial Lands Act and is supported by official survey records. It reflects a key administrative step in land management and disposition, with potential environmental, legal, and community implications that should be considered in the broader context of the land sale.
