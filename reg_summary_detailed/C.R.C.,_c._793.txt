**Detailed Summary of the Spirit Destruction Remission Order**

---

**Order Title:**  
*Spirit Destruction Remission Order*

---

**Purpose of the Order:**  
This regulation establishes a framework for the *remission (i.e., exemption or cancellation) of excise duty* in specific circumstances where spirits are destroyed due to accidents that occur during transportation or handling within licensed bonding warehouses. It is designed to provide relief to entities involved in the storage and movement of spirits—such as producers, distributors, or warehouse operators—when loss or destruction of spirits results from unforeseen accidents, rather than from negligence or illegal activity.

---

**Key Definitions:**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Excise Act*, which governs the taxation, regulation, and control of alcohol and other excisable goods in Canada.  
- **"Bonding warehouse"** has the same meaning as defined in the Excise Act. These are facilities licensed by the Minister of National Revenue where excisable goods (such as spirits) are stored under excise control, typically without the need to pay excise duty during storage, provided they remain in bond.

---

**Scope of Remission (Exemption from Excise Duty):**

Under this Order, excise duty payable under:
- **Section 52 of the Excise Act** (which governs the payment of excise duty on spirits),
- And **subsection 54(1)** of the Act (which relates to the release of spirits from bond and associated duty obligations),

**may be remitted (forgiven or waived)** in the following circumstances:

1. **Accidents occurring during transportation** of spirits while they are in bond (i.e., in transit between locations, under excise control).  
2. **Accidents occurring during handling** of spirits within a licensed bonding warehouse.

> In both cases, the destruction must be due to an accident—not due to negligence, failure to act reasonably, or illegal conduct.

---

**Conditions for Granting Remission (Under Section 3 of the Act):**

Remission is *not automatic* and is subject to strict conditions. To qualify, the following requirements must be met:

1. **Written Request to the Minister of National Revenue:**  
   The party seeking remission must submit a formal, written request to the Minister. This request must include all necessary documentation to support the claim.

2. **Documentary Evidence Required to Prove the Following:**

   a. **No Illegal Removal of Spirits:**  
   The spirits must not have been illegally removed from the bonding warehouse. Any evidence of unauthorized removal, diversion, or smuggling would disqualify the claim.

   b. **No Negligence or Failure to Exercise Reasonable Diligence:**  
   The destruction must not have resulted from:
   - The failure of the **shipper** (the party responsible for transporting the spirits),
   - The **warehouse operator** (the entity managing the bonded warehouse), or
   - The **transportation company** (the carrier involved in moving the spirits)  
   to exercise **reasonable diligence and effective control** over their operations.

   > This means the accident must be unforeseeable and not attributable to poor management, oversight, or operational failure.

   c. **Destruction Occurred Before Release from Excise Control:**  
   The spirits must have been destroyed *before* they were released from the control of excise officers. This ensures that the loss occurred within the protected period of bond and not after the goods were no longer under official supervision.

---

**Exclusions and Limitations:**

- The remission does **not apply** if the destruction results from:
  - Illegal removal of spirits,
  - Negligence or failure to exercise reasonable care,
  - Deliberate misconduct,
  - Or if the spirits were released from bond before destruction.

- The requirement to prove "reasonable diligence and effective control" places a significant burden on the applicant to demonstrate that all reasonable precautions were taken.

---

**General Provision:**

- **Section 4 (Exception):**  
  This remission provision is subject to Section 4 of the Order, which likely sets out conditions under which the remission *does not apply* (e.g., if the destruction is due to fraud, mismanagement, or non-compliance with excise rules). The exact content of Section 4 is not provided here but is implied as a limiting clause.

---

**Administrative Process:**

- The Minister of National Revenue has the discretion to grant or deny remission based on the evidence submitted.
- The request must be accompanied by sufficient documentation (e.g., incident reports, photographs, logs, inspection records) to establish the facts outlined above.

---

**Policy Rationale:**

This Order balances regulatory oversight with practical realities in the spirits industry. It recognizes that accidents during transportation or warehouse handling are rare but can occur due to unforeseen events (e.g., fire, spillage, natural disaster). By providing remission in such cases, the government:
- Encourages safe handling and transport practices,
- Avoids undue financial penalties for legitimate, accidental losses,
- Maintains compliance with excise regulations while being responsive to operational risks.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Spirit Destruction Remission Order* provides a clear, conditional pathway for excise duty remission when spirits are destroyed due to accidents during transportation or handling in bonded warehouses. However, eligibility is strictly limited to cases where:
- The loss is accidental,
- No illegal activity occurred,
- No negligence or failure to act reasonably is proven,
- And the destruction occurred before release from excise control.

This regulation ensures that the excise system remains both fair and effective—protecting legitimate business operations while maintaining accountability and integrity in the handling of excisable goods.
