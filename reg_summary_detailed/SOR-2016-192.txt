Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the *Science Education Sets Regulations*, S.C. 2010, c. 21, made under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act* (CCPSA), as recommended by the Minister of Health and approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council.

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Science Education Sets Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of these regulations is to **ensure the safety of science education sets** used in schools, homes, and educational institutions. These sets are designed to teach scientific concepts through hands-on experiments involving chemicals. The regulation sets strict limits on the types and quantities of hazardous chemicals that can be included in such sets, with the goal of **protecting children and users from exposure to dangerous substances**.

These rules apply specifically to **science education sets** and their **replacement chemicals**, ensuring that they are safe for educational use, especially when children may be involved.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Science Education Set** | A collection of products, materials, or substances containing a *chemical product* (as defined in the *Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001*) intended to instruct users about a scientific concept. Examples include chemistry kits, biology experiment kits, etc. |
| **Replacement Chemical** | A chemical product used to restock or refill a science education set. It must meet the same safety standards as the original set. |
| **Oral LD50 Value** | The single dose of a substance administered orally to animals that is expected to cause death in at least 50% of the test population. It is a measure of toxicity. A lower value indicates higher toxicity. |

---

### **3. Prohibited Chemicals in Science Education Sets**

A chemical **must not be included** in a science education set if:

- It is **listed in the schedule** (i.e., specifically prohibited);
- Its **oral LD50 value is equal to or less than 50 mg/kg** of body weight in an animal test (indicating high toxicity);
- It is **required in any experiment** described in the instructions of the set or its replacement chemical.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This means that even if a chemical is used in a safe way under supervision, it cannot be included if it has a high toxicity level or is listed as restricted.

---

### **4. Restrictions on Quantity of Chemicals**

Any chemical included in a science education set or replacement chemical must **not be sold in an amount exceeding five times the oral LD50 value**, calculated for a **child weighing 20 kg**.

#### Example:
- If a chemical has an oral LD50 of 50 mg/kg:
  - Maximum allowable amount = 5 × 50 mg/kg × 20 kg = **5,000 mg (5 grams)**.
- This ensures that even in the event of accidental ingestion, the quantity is not excessive and poses a manageable risk.

> ✅ This restriction is designed to reduce the risk of poisoning in children, who are more vulnerable due to their smaller body size and less developed metabolic systems.

---

### **5. Packaging Requirements**

All chemicals in science education sets and replacement chemicals must be packaged in containers that meet the requirements of the *Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001*, including:

- Proper labeling in both **English and French**;
- Clear, prominent, and contrasting labeling that stands out from other information;
- Readily visible to consumers at the time of purchase or during use.

Additionally, the container must display:

- The **common name** of the chemical or its name as accepted by the **International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)**;
- If the oral LD50 is between **50 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg**, the **hazard symbol** as specified in Schedule 2, Item 1, Column 2 of the *Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations*, 2001 — applied according to rules in paragraphs 17(b), and sections 18, 21, 22, 25, and 26 of those regulations;
- Any required **hazard symbols and information** under the general container labeling requirements of the 2001 Regulations.

> 📌 This ensures that users (especially teachers and parents) can quickly identify hazardous substances and understand the risks.

---

### **6. Mandatory Safety Warnings**

Every science education set must:

- Include **clear directions for the safe use** of all chemicals contained within it;
- Display the following **warning statement** on its container and any accompanying literature:

> **WARNING. This set contains chemicals that may be harmful if misused. Read the information in the instruction manual. If splashed in the eyes, or on skin, flush thoroughly with water. Get medical attention immediately if splashed in eyes. Not to be used by children except under adult supervision. Not recommended for children under 12 years of age.**

> **AVERTISSEMENT. Ce nécessaire contient des produits chimiques qui peuvent être nocifs s’ils sont mal utilisés. Lire les indications de la brochure d’instructions. En cas d’éclaboussures sur la peau ou dans les yeux, bien rincer à grande eau. Recourir immédiatement aux soins du médecin si les yeux ont été touchés. Ne doit pas être utilisé par des enfants qui ne sont pas sous la surveillance d’un adulte. Contre-indiqué pour les enfants de moins de 12 ans.**

> ✅ This warning is critical to prevent misuse, especially in homes or classrooms where children may not be properly supervised.

---

### **7. Prohibited Experiments and Procedures**

Science education sets **must not contain or display** any instruction, description, or wording that suggests or promotes:

- Cultivating or demonstrating the presence of **pathogenic microorganisms** (e.g., bacteria, viruses that can cause disease);
- Cultivating any microorganism that may be present in or come from a product or substance that could contain **pathogenic organisms**;
- Demonstrating the presence of any microorganism in such substances.

> ❌ This restriction is in place to **prevent the risk of disease transmission**, such as from bacteria like *Salmonella*, *E. coli*, or *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, which could be present in certain biological samples.

> 🚫 Examples of prohibited activities:
> - Growing bacteria from raw meat or soil;
> - Using untreated water samples to grow microbes;
> - Demonstrating the growth of mold or fungi from potentially contaminated sources.

> ✅ This protects students and educators from biological hazards that could lead to illness.

### **8. Exemptions and Allowed Chemicals**

Certain chemicals are **exempted** from the general prohibitions and restrictions, provided they are used in **safe, controlled concentrations**. These include:

| Chemical | Condition of Use |
|--------|------------------|
| Inorganic acids | Only **aqueous hydrochloric acid** containing **less than 5%** acid |
| Organic acids | Only **aqueous acetic acid** (vinegar) containing **less than 5%** acid |
| Ammonium hydroxide | Allowed without restriction |
| Potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide | Only in aqueous solutions with **≤1% concentration** |
| Oxidizing compounds | Only in aqueous solutions with **≤10%** of the following: ammonium nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, potassium nitrate, strontium nitrate, or other oxidizing compounds |
| Potassium permanganate | Only in aqueous solutions with **≤10%** concentration |
| Manganese dioxide | Allowed (no restriction specified) |
| Hydrogen peroxide | Only in aqueous solutions with **≤3%** concentration |
| Methanol | Allowed **only** if used for operating a spirit lamp (as per instructions) |

> ⚠️ Note: Even though these chemicals are allowed, they must still comply with all other safety rules (e.g., labeling, safe handling, warnings, and quantities).

> 💡 The exemption for **methanol in spirit lamps** is a practical exception — it is a common component in science experiments to demonstrate combustion, but must be used strictly as directed and with proper safety precautions.

---

### **9. Regulatory Enforcement and Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day of registration** (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).
- They are **binding on all manufacturers, distributors, and sellers** of science education sets in Canada.
- The regulations are enforced under the authority of the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act*, meaning compliance is mandatory, and non-compliance can result in penalties.
