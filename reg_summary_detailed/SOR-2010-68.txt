---

### **Overview**

The *Mortgage Insurance Business (Banks, Authorized Foreign Banks, Trust and Loan Companies, Retail Associations, Canadian Insurance Companies and Canadian Societies) Regulations* are a set of regulatory rules established by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under several key statutes in Canada’s financial and insurance legislation. These regulations aim to **ensure transparency, fairness, and market integrity** in the pricing and financial arrangements related to mortgage insurance provided to financial institutions.

The primary objective is to **prevent conflicts of interest and improper financial benefits** between mortgage insurers and institutions (such as banks or credit cooperatives) that provide mortgage loans, particularly in relation to the cost of mortgage insurance and any associated payments or benefits.

### **Statutory Authority**

The regulations are made under the following provisions of Canadian federal law:

1. **Bank Act**:
   - Subsections **418.1(2)a** and **552(2)b**  
     → Apply to banks and authorized foreign banks, regulating the cost of mortgage insurance and ensuring that institutions do not receive undue financial advantages from insurers.

2. **Cooperative Credit Associations Act**:
   - Subsection **382.2(2)d**  
     → Applies to retail associations (cooperative credit institutions), ensuring fair treatment in mortgage insurance arrangements.

3. **Insurance Companies Act**:

### **Scope and Exemption**

> **Exception**:  
> These regulations **do not apply** to an institution that has obtained mortgage insurance from an insurer **if neither the institution nor any of its affiliates charges borrowers any fee for the mortgage insurance**.

This means that if the institution passes on the full cost of mortgage insurance to the borrower (i.e., no additional charge), then the rules governing payments or benefits from insurers do not apply.

---

### **Definition of "Actual Cost" of Mortgage Insurance**

For the purposes of compliance with the relevant sections of the above acts, the **actual cost** to an institution is defined as:

> The amount the institution incurs for mortgage insurance **minus** any direct or indirect payments or benefits it receives from the insurer — including rebates, commissions, fees, or other incentives.

#### **Important Exclusions from Actual Cost**:
The following payments or benefits are **not considered part of the actual cost**:
1. Payments or benefits not related to the provision of mortgage insurance.
2. Payments received by the institution for activities **permitted under section 4** of the relevant act (e.g., standard banking or lending services).
3. Payments received by the institution **in respect of a claim made under mortgage insurance** due to a borrower default (i.e., claims paid by the insurer).

> This ensures that the "actual cost" reflects only the true financial burden of obtaining mortgage insurance, excluding unrelated or claim-based payments.

---

### **Permitted Arrangements with Insurers**

#### **1. Payments for Products and Services (Market Terms)**
An institution may enter into an arrangement with an insurer to receive payments or benefits **for products and services offered to customers** (e.g., mortgage advice, home loans, financial planning), **provided**:
- The arrangement is conducted on **market terms and conditions** (i.e., fair, transparent, and competitive).
- It is not linked to marketing or promotional activities.

> Example: A bank may receive a commission from an insurer for each mortgage application processed — if such a commission is at arm’s length and reflects market value.

#### **2. Payments for Other Activities (Fair Market Conditions)**
An institution may receive payments or benefits for **activities other than those in paragraph 1**, **only if**:
- The terms are **fair and reasonable**, comparable to what would be expected in an open market between independent, prudent, and knowledgeable parties (i.e., "arm’s length" conditions).
- The arrangement is **necessary** for the provision of mortgage insurance.
- The arrangement **does not involve** payments or benefits in respect of **marketing, advertising, or promotional activities** (as defined below).

> This allows limited financial incentives, but strictly limits them to essential, non-promotional functions.

---

### **Prohibited Arrangements**

The regulations **explicitly prohibit** the following actions:

1. **Marketing, Advertising, or Promotional Activities**:
   - No institution may enter into an arrangement to receive:
     - Direct or indirect payments from an insurer (or its affiliates) for **marketing, advertising, or promotional activities** conducted by the institution, insurer, or third parties.

2. **Payments to Employees or Representatives**:
   - No employee or representative of the institution may accept:
     - Direct or indirect payments or benefits from an insurer (or its affiliates) related to marketing or promotional activities.

3. **Affiliate Payments**:
   - No affiliate **controlled by the institution** may:
     - Enter into arrangements to receive payments or benefits from an insurer (or its affiliates) related to marketing, advertising, or promotional activities.

> These prohibitions are designed to **prevent conflicts of interest**, **avoid misleading incentives**, and **maintain consumer trust** in the mortgage lending process.
