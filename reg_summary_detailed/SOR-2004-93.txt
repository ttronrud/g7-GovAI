### **Key Provisions and Summary:**

1. **Withdrawal of General Preferential Tariff Benefits:**  
   The regulation formally **withdraws the benefit of the General Preferential Tariff** (GPT) for all goods that originate in the following countries:  
   - Cyprus  
   - Czech Republic  
   - Republic of Estonia  
   - Hungary  
   - Republic of Latvia  
   - Republic of Lithuania  
   - Malta  
   - Poland  
   - Slovak Republic  
   - Republic of Slovenia  

   This means that goods originating from these countries are **no longer eligible** for reduced or preferential tariff rates when imported into Canada under the General Preferential Tariff scheme.

2. **Reason for Withdrawal:**  
   The withdrawal is attributed to these countries’ **accession to the European Union (EU)**.  
   The regulation reflects a policy adjustment where Canada, in response to EU membership, removes preferential tariff treatment for goods from these countries. This is typically done to ensure alignment with international trade agreements and to prevent potential distortions in trade policy due to EU membership.

3. **Exemption for Goods in Transit:**  
   **Section 1 of the Order does not apply** to goods that were **in transit to Canada before May 1, 2004**.  
   This means that goods that were already in the process of being transported into Canada prior to the effective date of the Order (i.e., May 1, 2004) and were still in transit at that time are **exempt** from the tariff withdrawal.  
   In practical terms, this provides **legal certainty and continuity** for shipments that were already underway, preventing retroactive penalties or tariff increases for such goods.

4. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order **comes into force on May 1, 2004**.  
   This date marks the official start of the withdrawal of preferential tariff treatment for goods originating from the listed countries.  
   All goods originating from these countries after this date will be subject to the standard (non-preferential) tariff rates unless otherwise provided under other trade agreements.

### **Implications and Context:**

- **Trade Policy Alignment:**  
  Canada’s decision to withdraw preferential tariff treatment reflects its alignment with the EU’s single market and common trade policies. Once a country joins the EU, it is generally expected to conform to EU-wide trade rules, and Canada may adjust its preferential tariff arrangements accordingly.

- **Impact on Importers and Exporters:**  
  Canadian importers and businesses sourcing goods from these countries will now face **higher tariff rates** (or standard duties) for goods originating from these nations, unless those goods qualify under other trade agreements (e.g., free trade agreements with the EU or other partners).

- **Economic Considerations:**  
  This change may affect trade flows, especially for goods such as machinery, textiles, or agricultural products, and could influence supply chain decisions by exporters and importers.

- **Legal and Administrative Clarity:**  
  The inclusion of the transit exemption ensures that businesses with goods already in transit are not unfairly penalized due to a policy change that takes effect on a specific date.

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation is a targeted adjustment to Canada’s preferential tariff system in response to the accession of several Central and Eastern European countries to the European Union. It removes the General Preferential Tariff benefits for goods originating in Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia, effective May 1, 2004. Importantly, goods in transit to Canada before that date are exempt from the withdrawal, ensuring continuity and fairness in trade operations. The measure underscores Canada’s commitment to international trade alignment and reflects the dynamic nature of global trade policy in response to geopolitical and economic developments.
