**Detailed Summary of the Allowance Exclusion Order**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

The **Allowance Exclusion Order**, issued under the authority of the **Treasury Board** pursuant to **subsection 2(1)** of the *Public Sector Compensation Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 30), serves a critical function in defining what constitutes the **"wage rate"** for the purposes of the Act.

The **definition of "wage rate"** in subsection 2(1) of the *Public Sector Compensation Act* is central to determining eligibility and benefits under various public sector compensation and insurance programs—particularly those related to **workers’ compensation**, **disability benefits**, and **family benefits**. However, not all forms of compensation (such as allowances, bonuses, or premiums) are intended to be included in the wage rate calculation. This Order explicitly identifies which allowances, bonuses, differentials, premiums, or other emoluments **should be excluded** from the wage rate calculation.

### **Key Objectives of the Order**

1. **Clarify Exclusions**: To clearly specify which types of employee benefits or payments are **not included** in the calculation of the "wage rate" under subsection 2(1) of the Act.
2. **Ensure Accuracy and Fairness**: To prevent over-inclusion of non-core compensation (e.g., travel allowances or performance bonuses) in wage rate calculations, which could distort benefit entitlements or lead to unfair outcomes.
3. **Provide Legal Certainty**: To offer a transparent, codified, and enforceable framework for public sector employers and benefit administrators to apply the correct wage rate definition.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Public Sector Compensation Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 30). This is the primary legislation governing compensation and benefits for public sector employees. |
| **Allowance** | Any form of payment or benefit that falls within the scope of the "wage rate" definition in subsection 2(1), including: <br> - Allowances <br> - Bonuses <br> - Differentials <br> - Premiums <br> - Other emoluments or benefits. |
| **Group** | A defined group of employees identified by a unique code and listed in **Schedule II**. Each group represents a specific category of employees (e.g., teachers, police officers, administrative staff), and the exclusions apply only to members of those groups. |

### **Core Provision: What is Excluded from the Wage Rate?**

The Order specifies **which allowances are excluded** from the wage rate calculation **based on specific conditions**.

#### Structure of the Exclusion Rule:
Each exclusion is set out in **Schedule I**, organized in **three columns**:

| Column | Content |
|-------|--------|
| **Column I** | Lists the **specific type of allowance** (e.g., "differential for remote work," "travel allowance") that is excluded. |
| **Column II** | Identifies the **group(s)** of employees** to whom the exclusion applies (e.g., "Group 12: Police Officers"). |
| **Column III** | Specifies the **circumstances** under which the allowance is excluded. |

> **Example**:  
> An item in Schedule I might state:  
> - **Column I**: "Remote Work Differential"  
> - **Column II**: "Group 5: Field Technicians"  
> - **Column III**: "When the employee works from a remote location and is not on-site for more than 50% of their workweek."  

In this case, the **remote work differential** is **not included** in the wage rate for **field technicians** who work remotely more than 50% of the time.

### **Interpretation of Column III**

- Unless otherwise specified, **any reference in Column III** refers to the **applicable collective agreement** governing that group.
- This means that the **terms of the collective agreement** (e.g., union contracts, negotiated terms) determine when the allowance is excluded.
- For example, if a collective agreement provides that a travel allowance is only payable when an employee travels outside the province, then that condition may be the basis for exclusion from the wage rate.

This ensures that exclusions are **not arbitrary** but are tied to **legally binding, negotiated agreements** between the government and employee representatives.

### **Legal Citation and Authority**

- The Order is formally cited as the **Allowance Exclusion Order**.
- It is issued under the **Treasury Board’s authority** to interpret and apply the definition of "wage rate" in the *Public Sector Compensation Act*.
- It is binding on all public sector employers and benefit administrators when determining wage rates for purposes of compensation and insurance benefits.

---

### **Practical Implications**

1. **For Employees**:  
   - Employees may receive certain benefits (e.g., travel, housing, or performance bonuses) that do not count toward their wage rate. This affects the amount of benefits they are entitled to under programs like disability or family benefits.

2. **For Employers**:  
   - Employers must accurately track and report which allowances are excluded when calculating wage rates for payroll, insurance, or benefit purposes.
   - They must ensure compliance with the specific conditions in Schedule I, particularly those tied to collective agreements.

3. **For Benefit Administrators**:  
   - When assessing claims (e.g., for disability or maternity benefits), administrators must exclude specified allowances when calculating the base wage rate, ensuring accurate and fair outcomes.

---

### **Limitations and Scope**

- The Order **only applies** to allowances listed in **Schedule I**.
- Exclusions are **conditional**—they only apply when the specified circumstances (e.g., work location, job type, collective agreement terms) are met.
- The Order does **not** apply to all allowances or all employees. It is **group-specific** and **circumstance-dependent**.

### **Conclusion**

The **Allowance Exclusion Order** provides a **clear, structured, and legally grounded mechanism** for excluding certain types of employee benefits from the calculation of the "wage rate" under the *Public Sector Compensation Act*. By linking exclusions to specific employee groups and defined circumstances—often tied to collective agreements—the Order ensures that the wage rate reflects only **core compensation**, enhancing fairness, transparency, and consistency in public sector benefit calculations.

This regulation is essential for maintaining the integrity of compensation systems and ensuring that employee benefits are calculated accurately and equitably across different roles and work environments within the public sector.

**Final Note**: This Order must be reviewed periodically to reflect changes in collective agreements, employee groups, or legislative amendments to the *Public Sector Compensation Act*.
