**Detailed Summary of the Canada Assistance Plan (British Columbia) Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Purpose**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Minister of Employment and Immigration and the Treasury Board) to make orders related to the remission (forgiveness or cancellation) of certain financial obligations under specific public programs.  

The purpose of this Order is to **remit (cancel or forgive) monies** that were previously owed by the **Province of British Columbia** to the federal government under the *Canada Assistance Plan (CAP)*. The remission is specifically tied to a breach of agreement between the federal government and British Columbia, and it addresses a financial liability arising from that breach.

---

**2. Official Citation**  
The Order is officially titled:  
**Canada Assistance Plan (British Columbia) Remission Order**  
It is referenced in the *Statutes of Canada*, 1991, Chapter 24, Section 7(2), and may be cited accordingly.

---

**3. Key Definitions**  
In this Order, the terms **"agreement"** and **"contribution"** are defined to have the same meanings as in **Section 3 of the Canada Assistance Plan**. This ensures consistency with the broader framework of the CAP, which governs how provinces receive financial assistance from the federal government based on their respective fiscal and social conditions.

---

**4. Scope of the Remission**  
The Order grants a **remission of monies** that were received by the Province of British Columbia **before December 1, 1995**, in respect of a contribution that was due under the Canada Assistance Plan for the **fiscal year ending March 31, 1996**.

Specifically, the remitted amount corresponds to the **contribution payable** to the Province in respect of the following months:
- **December 1995**
- **January 1996**
- **February 1996**
- **March 1996**

These monies were calculated under **Section 13 of the Canada Assistance Plan Regulations**, which sets out the method for determining the contribution a province must pay to the federal government based on its financial situation and agreement terms.

---

**5. Basis for Remission: Breach of Agreement**  
The remission is not a general cancellation of obligations but is specifically justified because the **Province of British Columbia was in breach of its agreement with the federal government since December 1, 1995**.  

As a result of this breach, the federal government had a legal claim (a "debt") against the Province. This debt arose because the Province failed to meet its financial commitments under the CAP agreement. The remission of the monies is therefore a **settlement or adjustment** of that debt, effectively forgiving the amount that would have been due under the original agreement for those months.

---

**6. Nature of the Debt**  
The monies in question represent a **debt owing to Her Majesty in right of Canada**. This means the financial obligation is a legal liability of the Province to the federal government, stemming from its failure to comply with the terms of the CAP agreement.

By remitting these monies, the federal government is effectively **cancelling or forgiving** this debt, which may be viewed as a form of financial relief or administrative adjustment to correct a breach.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**  
- **Financial Relief for British Columbia**: The remission reduces the Province’s outstanding financial obligations to the federal government, which may have been significant due to the breach.
- **Administrative Adjustment**: The Order reflects a policy decision to adjust financial responsibilities in response to a failure to meet contractual obligations, rather than enforcing full repayment.
- **Public Interest Justification**: The Governor General in Council determined that it is in the **public interest** to make this remission, suggesting that the decision balances fiscal responsibility with equitable treatment of provinces facing financial or administrative challenges.
- **Legal and Procedural Precedent**: This Order serves as a precedent for future remissions under the CAP, particularly when provinces are in breach of their financial agreements.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Canada Assistance Plan (British Columbia) Remission Order* is a targeted financial adjustment that cancels a portion of the Province of British Columbia’s debt to the federal government, specifically related to the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996. This remission is grounded in the breach of an agreement by British Columbia starting December 1, 1995, and is authorized under the *Financial Administration Act*. The decision reflects a balance between fiscal accountability and public interest, providing relief to a province that was in non-compliance with its financial obligations under the Canada Assistance Plan.
