### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Veterans Review and Appeal Board Regulations* were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Veterans Affairs**, under **section 45 of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act**. These regulations repeal the previous *Veterans Appeal Board Regulations* (Order in Council P.C. 1987-2146), and establish a new, updated procedural framework governing applications and appeals to the **Veterans Review and Appeal Board (Board)**.

These regulations came into force on **January 1, 1995**, and are now the official rules governing the procedures for reviewing and appealing decisions made by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) in relation to veterans’ benefits, pensions, and other entitlements.

The regulations are officially cited as:  
**Veterans Review and Appeal Board Regulations**  
(SOR/87-601, 1987 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 3949; S.C. 1995, c. 18)

If the Board determines that the question is **not trivial, frivolous, or vexatious**, it must:

- **Annex to the notice**:
