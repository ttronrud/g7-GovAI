**Detailed Summary of the Watson Lake Hospital Divestiture Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Watson Lake Hospital Divestiture Regulations* were made by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, pursuant to specific provisions in two key federal statutes:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a and subsection 42.1(2)b of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**  
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**

These regulations were enacted to address the **superannuation (pension) rights** of public service employees who transitioned from employment at **Watson Lake Hospital** — formerly part of the Yukon Government — to a new employer under a formal agreement between the Government of Canada and that new employer.

The regulations came into force on **April 1, 2010**, and are codified in **S.C. 2003, c. 22, par. 225(z.19)**, and referenced in earlier statutes such as **S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 22**, and **R.S. c. P-36** and **R.S. c. F-11**.

### **Key Definitions and Scope**

#### **"New Employer"**
- A *new employer* is defined as a person or entity that, through a formal agreement with **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, assumes the operations and responsibilities previously carried out by Watson Lake Hospital.
- This term establishes the legal and administrative framework for the transfer of services and employment from the public sector to a private or non-public entity.

#### **Applicability of the Regulations**
- These regulations apply to individuals who:
  - Cease to be employed in the **public service** (i.e., lose their public service status)
  - And **become employed by a new employer** as a result of the agreement.
- **Exception**: The regulations **do not apply** to individuals who become **re-employed** by the same new employer after initially leaving public service.

---

### **Exclusions and Special Provisions**

#### **Survivors and Children of Deceased Employees**
- The regulations **exclude** certain provisions regarding survivors and dependents when a person has:
  - Received a **return of contributions**, or
  - Exercised an **option under section 13.01 of the PSSA** (related to pension options).
- In such cases, **sections 4 to 6** of the PSSA (which may relate to survivor benefits or dependents' entitlements) **do not apply**.

#### **Application of Sections 12 to 13.01 of the PSSA**
- These sections (relating to **pension benefits, return of contributions, and death benefits**) **only apply to a person on or after the date they cease to be employed by the new employer**.
- This means that the rights and obligations under these sections begin **only when the individual transitions out of public service** and into employment with the new employer.

---

### **Return of Contributions and Exercise of Options**

#### **When a Return of Contributions Is Allowed**
- If, **on or after April 1, 2010**, a person would have otherwise been entitled to a **return of contributions** under **subsection 12(3) of the PSSA**, they may:
  - **Request a return of contributions in writing** within **one year** of ceasing public service and becoming employed by the new employer.

#### **When an Option to Receive a Pension Can Be Exercised**
- If, under the same circumstances, the person would have been entitled to **exercise an option** under **section 13.01 of the PSSA** (e.g., to take a lump sum or deferred pension), they may:
  - **Exercise that option within the same one-year period** after ceasing public service.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This one-year window is critical and applies only to individuals who would have otherwise qualified under the PSSA had they remained in public service.

---

### **Survivor and Dependent Benefits**

If a public service employee dies while employed by the new employer, their **survivors and children** are entitled to one of the following benefits — as if the employee had remained in public service:

1. **Death benefit under subsection 12(8) of the PSSA**  
   – A lump sum payment to the surviving spouse or dependent.

2. **Allowances under subsection 13(3) of the PSSA**  
   – Monthly or other allowances for dependents (e.g., children).

> This ensures that the **family benefits** of public service employees are preserved even after they transition to private employment.

---

### **Key Interpretations and Application of PSSA Provisions**

#### **Cessation of Public Service Employment**
- For the purposes of **subsection 26(2) of the PSSA**, a person is **deemed to cease being employed in the public service** on the day they **cease to be employed by the new employer**.

#### **One-Year Period for Certain Benefits**
- The **one-year period** referred to in **paragraph (a) of subsection 10(5) of the PSSA** (which governs the timing for claiming benefits or exercising options) **starts on the day the individual ceases to be employed by the new employer**.

#### **Pensionable Service and Age Determination**
- **Pensionable service** includes the period of service that:
  - Begins on the day the person **ceases to be employed in the public service**, and
  - Ends on the day they **cease to be employed by the new employer**.
- The person’s **age at cessation** is determined as their age on the day they **cease to be employed by the new employer**.

> This ensures that the employee's service record and age are accurately calculated for pension and benefit purposes, even though the employment transition occurred outside traditional public service structures.

### **Group Classification**

- All contributors to whom these regulations apply are considered **Group 1 contributors** under the PSSA.
- Group 1 typically includes **public service employees** and is subject to the full range of superannuation benefits and rules.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations are **deemed to have come into force on April 1, 2010**.
- This date marks the start of the application of these rules for any transition involving Watson Lake Hospital and a new employer.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The Watson Lake Hospital Divestiture Regulations serve as a **legal bridge** to ensure that public service employees who transition to private or non-governmental employers due to hospital divestiture are not left without:

- Access to **return of contributions**
- Ability to **exercise pension options**
- Protection of **survivor and dependent benefits**
- Fair treatment under **pension and superannuation rules** (especially those related to service, age, and eligibility)

By aligning the rights and obligations of these individuals with the existing PSSA framework, the regulations maintain **continuity, fairness, and legal consistency** in the treatment of employees during organizational transitions.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Watson Lake Hospital Divestiture Regulations provide a comprehensive and legally grounded mechanism to manage the **superannuation rights** of public service employees who move from a public hospital (Watson Lake Hospital) to a new employer. They ensure that:

- Employees retain access to key benefits (return of contributions, pension options, survivor benefits)
- Transition periods are clearly defined
- Legal and administrative continuity is maintained under the Public Service Superannuation Act
- The rights of dependents and survivors are protected

These regulations reflect a careful balance between **government restructuring** and **employee protection**, ensuring that public service employees are not disadvantaged due to changes in employment structure.

**Final Note**: These regulations are a specific example of how federal government policy adapts to real-world organizational changes while maintaining the integrity of public service pension systems.
