**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation Declaring a Public Order Emergency in Canada (February 14, 2022)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This proclamation is issued under the **Emergencies Act**, a federal law that enables the Government of Canada to declare a public order emergency and implement special temporary measures when there is a threat to public safety, security, or order. The declaration is made by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) on the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**, and it is authorized under **subsection 17(1)** of the Emergencies Act.

Prior to this declaration, the Governor in Council had consulted with:
- The **Lieutenant Governors in Council** of each province,
- The **Commissioners of Yukon and the Northwest Territories**, acting with the consent of their respective Executive Councils,
- The **Commissioner of Nunavut**.

This ensures regional consultation and adherence to provincial governance structures before invoking emergency powers.

### **2. Declaration of a Public Order Emergency**
The proclamation formally declares that a **public order emergency exists throughout Canada**. This emergency is not due to natural disasters, pandemics alone, or general civil unrest, but rather stems from a **systemic and sustained pattern of blockades** involving both individuals and motor vehicles across multiple locations in Canada.

The emergency is characterized by:
- **Ongoing blockades** at various locations,
- **Threats of violence or force** in opposition to the removal of these blockades,
- Activities that are **directed toward or in support of serious acts of violence** against persons or property — including **critical infrastructure** — with the intent to achieve **political or ideological objectives** within Canada.

---

### **3. Specific Components of the Emergency**

The proclamation identifies **four key components** that justify the emergency:

#### **(a) Threat to Public Order and Safety**
- Blockades are being carried out in a coordinated manner and are associated with threats of **violence or force** to oppose their removal.
- These blockades are not isolated incidents but are part of a broader campaign aimed at achieving political or ideological goals through disruption and intimidation.

#### **(b) Economic Consequences and Threats to Economic Security**
- The blockades are **disrupting critical infrastructure**, including:
  - Trade corridors,
  - International border crossings.
- This disruption is **harming Canada’s economic recovery** from the **COVID-19 pandemic**.
- The economic damage threatens **Canada’s economic security**, including its ability to trade and maintain supply chains.

#### **(c) Damage to International Relations**
- The blockades are **undermining Canada’s relationships with key trading partners**, particularly the **United States**.
- These actions are seen as **detrimental to Canada’s national interests**, including diplomatic stability and economic cooperation.

#### **(d) Breakdown in Supply Chains and Availability of Essentials**
- Blockades are causing a **breakdown in the distribution chain** of essential goods, services, and resources.
- There is a **real and growing risk** that this breakdown will worsen if blockades continue to increase in number and intensity.
- This poses a direct threat to **public health, safety, and daily life**.

#### **(e) Risk of Escalation to Unrest and Violence**
- The situation carries a **significant risk of increased unrest and violence**, which could endanger the lives and safety of Canadians.

### **4. Special Temporary Measures Authorized**
Under subsection 17(1) of the Emergencies Act, the proclamation authorizes the following **special temporary measures** to address the emergency:

#### **(a) Regulation or Prohibition of Public Assemblies**
- Any public assembly (except lawful advocacy, protest, or dissent) that may reasonably be expected to lead to a **breach of the peace** can be regulated or prohibited.
- Travel to, from, or within **specific areas** where blockades occur may also be restricted or regulated.
- The use of **specified property** (e.g., vehicles, equipment) that supports or is used in blockades may be prohibited.
- **Protected places** — especially **critical infrastructure** — may be designated and secured to prevent attack or disruption.

#### **(b) Authorization of Essential Services**
- The government may **authorize or direct individuals** to provide essential services such as:
  - Removal, towing, or storage of vehicles or objects involved in blockades.
- These services are critical to restoring public safety and economic function.
- The government will identify which services are essential and who is qualified to provide them.
- Reasonable **compensation** will be provided to individuals who render such services.

#### **(c) Financial and Financial Transaction Measures**
- The government may:
  - Require **crowdfunding platforms** and **payment processors** to report transactions related to blockade-supporting activities to the **Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)**.
  - Require **financial service providers** to determine whether they hold or control property belonging to individuals involved in blockades.
- These measures aim to **cut off financial support** for blockade activities and prevent illicit funding.

#### **(d) Enforcement Authority for Law Enforcement**
- The **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** is authorized to **enforce municipal and provincial laws** through **incorporation by reference**.
- This allows RCMP officers to apply local laws (such as those related to assembly, obstruction, or public order) in a way that is consistent with federal emergency powers.

#### **(e) Penalties for Violations**
- Fines or **imprisonment** may be imposed on individuals who **contravene orders or regulations** issued under **section 19** of the Emergencies Act.
- These penalties are intended to deter unlawful behavior and ensure compliance with emergency measures.

#### **(f) Other Temporary Measures**
- The proclamation explicitly allows for **other temporary measures** under section 19 of the Emergencies Act that are not yet known or specified.
- This provides flexibility for the government to adapt its response as the situation evolves.

### **5. Purpose and Intent**
The primary objectives of this emergency proclamation are:
- To **restore public order** and prevent further violence.
- To **protect critical infrastructure** and ensure the continuity of essential services.
- To **stabilize the economy** and maintain Canada’s international trade relationships.
- To **prevent the escalation of civil unrest** and protect the safety of all Canadians.

---

### **6. Key Legal and Political Implications**

- **Proportionality and Legality**: The measures are framed as necessary and proportionate to the specific threat posed by the blockades and associated violence.
- **Checks and Balances**: The requirement to consult provincial leaders before declaring the emergency reflects a balance between federal authority and provincial autonomy.
- **Public Accountability**: The proclamation is published and affixed with the **Great Seal of Canada**, ensuring transparency and legal validity.
- **Temporary Nature**: The emergency is declared as a **temporary measure**, and the government must review and potentially end the emergency after a set period or when the threat subsides.

### **7. Context and Background (Implied)**
Although not explicitly detailed in the text, the context suggests that this proclamation was likely a response to a **wave of coordinated blockades** in 2022 — possibly linked to political or social movements — that were disrupting transportation, commerce, and public services. These blockades may have been organized with the intent to pressure the government on specific policy issues, but their scale and coordination raised concerns about public safety, economic stability, and national security.

---

### **Conclusion**
This proclamation represents a **serious and legally grounded invocation of emergency powers** by the Canadian government to respond to a national public order crisis. It is not a broad or vague declaration but is **specifically tied to the threat of blockades, violence, economic harm, and disruption of essential services**. The measures outlined are designed to:
- Restore order,
- Protect lives and infrastructure,
- Maintain economic stability,
- And preserve Canada’s international standing.

The declaration underscores the government’s responsibility to act decisively in times of national crisis while maintaining accountability through consultation, legal authority, and transparency.
