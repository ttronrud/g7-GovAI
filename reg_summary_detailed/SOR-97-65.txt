**Detailed Summary of the CIFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *CIFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 13(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This regulatory action is part of the implementation framework of the **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA)**.

The regulation is formally referenced as:
- **S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 75(1)**  
- **R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)**

This means it is a statutory instrument under the *Customs Tariff* and is part of the broader legislative structure governing the rules of origin for goods under the CIFTA.

### **Definition of "Casual Goods"**

The regulation defines **"casual goods"** as goods that are **not imported for sale or for any industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or other similar use**.  

This is in contrast to **commercial or industrial goods**, which are typically subject to different rules of origin based on their intended use. Casual goods are generally non-commercial in nature — for example, personal items, gifts, or goods imported for private use or consumption — and are not part of a business transaction or supply chain.

### **Rules of Origin for Casual Goods**

Under these regulations, **casual goods acquired in Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary country** (such as Israel, which is a key partner in CIFTA) are deemed to **originate in that country** and are **entitled to the tariff benefits** provided under the **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA)** — specifically, preferential tariff treatment under the CIFTA tariff schedule.

#### **Conditions for Origin Determination:**

A casual good is deemed to originate in Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary **if either of the following conditions is met**:

1. **Marking Requirement**:  
   The goods bear a **mark in accordance with the marking laws of Israel or the CIFTA beneficiary country**, and that mark **clearly indicates** that the goods are:
   - The product of Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary country, **or**
   - The product of Canada.

   This marking requirement ensures transparency and traceability of origin. It is designed to prevent fraud or misrepresentation of origin and to ensure that only goods that genuinely originate in a CIFTA country qualify for preferential treatment.

2. **Absence of Marking or Indication**:  
   If the goods **do not bear any mark**, and **no information or indication** is present to suggest that the goods are from either Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary or from Canada, then they are **still deemed to originate in Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary**.

   This provision is significant because it creates a **default origin rule** for unmarked goods. It simplifies the process for casual imports (e.g., personal items, gifts) that may not have visible labeling, ensuring that such goods still benefit from CIFTA’s tariff advantages — provided they are not clearly identifiable as Canadian-made.

> **Note**: This rule applies only when the goods are acquired in Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary country. Goods imported from other countries are not covered by these specific origin rules.

### **Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 45 of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (chapter 33 of the Statutes of Canada, 1996) comes into force.

- The **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** was enacted to provide the legal framework for implementing CIFTA.
- Section 45 establishes the effective date for the application of origin rules, including those for casual goods.

> **Note**: The regulations were in force as of **January 1, 1997**, as noted in the official notice (SI/97-9).

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The purpose of these regulations is to:

- Facilitate **tariff relief** for casual goods imported from Israel or other CIFTA partner countries.
- Provide **simplified origin rules** for goods not intended for commercial use, reducing administrative burden.
- Ensure **fair and transparent treatment** under the CIFTA agreement, especially for goods that may lack visible origin markings.
- Support **economic ties** between Canada and Israel by enabling easier cross-border trade for non-commercial goods.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Benefit to Importers**: Importers of casual goods (e.g., personal items, gifts, household goods) from Israel or other CIFTA countries may avoid customs duties if the goods meet the origin criteria.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Importers must ensure that goods either:
  - Are properly marked in accordance with the marking laws of the country of origin (Israel or another CIFTA country), or
  - Are not marked in a way that suggests a different origin.
- **No Requirement for Production or Manufacturing Link**: Unlike other origin rules, this regulation does not require proof of manufacturing or processing in Israel or another CIFTA country — it focuses on **marking or absence of indication**.

---

### **Limitations and Scope**

- Applies **only to casual goods** — not to goods imported for commercial, industrial, or institutional use.
- Applies **only to goods acquired in Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary**.
- Does **not extend to goods imported from non-CIFTA countries**.
- Does **not apply to goods that are clearly marked as Canadian-made** — such goods would not qualify for origin in Israel or another CIFTA country under this rule.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *CIFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* provide a **simplified and accessible framework** for determining the origin of non-commercial goods imported from Israel or other CIFTA partner countries. By focusing on marking and absence of indication, the rules ensure that personal and casual imports benefit from preferential tariff treatment under CIFTA, without requiring complex documentation or proof of production. This supports smoother, more equitable trade between Canada and Israel, particularly in the context of personal or non-commercial exchanges.
