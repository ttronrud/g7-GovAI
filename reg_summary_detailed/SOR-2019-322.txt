**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Inner Bay of Fundy Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
August 27, 2019  
Issued by: The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, which is a federal law enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) to protect and recover wildlife species at risk in Canada. The regulation specifically addresses the **critical habitat** of the **Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Inner Bay of Fundy population**, a distinct population segment of the Atlantic salmon that is legally designated as an **endangered species** under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA.

### **Key Provisions and Legal Basis**

1. **Endangered Status of the Species**  
   The Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Inner Bay of Fundy population is recognized as an endangered species under SARA. This designation means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

2. **Critical Habitat Identified in Recovery Strategy**  
   A recovery strategy for this population has been developed and formally included in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is the official database maintained by the Government of Canada to document species at risk and their recovery plans. This strategy identifies specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species — these areas are defined as *critical habitat*.

3. **Exclusion of Critical Habitat in Fundy National Park**  
   Under **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA, certain areas of critical habitat may be excluded from the official designation if they are located within a place designated under the *Canada National Parks Act* — specifically, **Fundy National Park of Canada**.  
   
   Additionally, **subsection 58(5)** of SARA requires that, when such an exclusion applies, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans must consult with the Minister responsible for Parks Canada (i.e., the Minister of the Environment) before issuing the Order.

4. **Consultation Requirement**  
   Prior to issuing this Order, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans conducted formal consultation with the **Minister of the Environment**, who is also responsible for Parks Canada. This consultation ensured that the exclusion of critical habitat within Fundy National Park was justified and consistent with the broader conservation goals of both agencies.

### **Core Provision of the Order**

- **Applicability of SARA Subsection 58(1)**  
  Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Atlantic Salmon Inner Bay of Fundy population — **except** for the portion of that habitat located within **Fundy National Park of Canada**.

- **Definition of Excluded Area**  
  The specific area excluded is defined in **Part 7 of Schedule 1 to the Canada National Parks Act**, which describes the boundaries and features of Fundy National Park. This means that although the area may have ecological value, it is *not* considered part of the official critical habitat designation due to its status as a protected national park.

- **Legal Justification for Exclusion**  
  The exclusion is legally justified under **subsection 58(2)** of SARA, which allows for the exclusion of critical habitat located within a national park. This exclusion is not a reduction in protection — rather, it reflects the fact that national parks are already protected under other legislation and that their management is governed by different environmental and conservation standards.

### **Purpose and Objectives**

- To **formally designate** the critical habitat of the Atlantic Salmon Inner Bay of Fundy population, while **excluding** the portion located within Fundy National Park.
- To ensure that **protection measures** are applied only to areas outside of the national park, where they are most needed for species recovery.
- To **comply with SARA’s procedural requirements**, including consultation with the Minister of the Environment, to ensure transparency, accountability, and inter-agency coordination.

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, which typically occurs shortly after publication. This ensures that the legal designation is active and enforceable from that date onward.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Ecological Protection**: The regulation ensures that the remaining portions of the critical habitat are legally protected from activities that could harm the Atlantic salmon’s survival (e.g., habitat degradation, pollution, or development).
- **Balancing Conservation and Land Use**: The exclusion from Fundy National Park reflects a balance between protecting species at risk and respecting the existing protections and management of national parks.
- **Inter-Agency Cooperation**: The requirement for consultation highlights the importance of collaboration between Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Parks Canada in managing shared natural resources and biodiversity.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally binding instrument under the Species at Risk Act that **designates critical habitat** for the endangered Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Inner Bay of Fundy population, **excluding** the portion located within Fundy National Park. It is issued in strict compliance with SARA’s procedural and substantive requirements, including consultation with the Minister of the Environment. The Order supports the recovery of this threatened species by ensuring that essential habitats outside the national park are protected, while recognizing the existing legal protections within the park.

This step is a critical component of the broader recovery strategy for the Atlantic salmon, contributing to long-term population stability and ecosystem resilience in the Fundy region.
