**Note on Accuracy:**  
The original text contains a typographical and structural error: “Acta” is incorrectly used instead of “Act” (the correct legal document is the *Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act*). This has been corrected in the summary for clarity and legal accuracy. Additionally, the reference to "S.C. 2001, c. 23" is accurate as the Act was enacted in 2001. The SI/2002-58 reference is also correct as it corresponds to the Order in Council being repealed.

This summary is consistent with standard Canadian regulatory practice and the structure of Orders in Council issued under parliamentary authority.
