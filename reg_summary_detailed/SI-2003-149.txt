The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SI/2006-60, s. 5]" — has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2006-60, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The specific regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally **repealed**.
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2006-60* (commonly referred to as the "SI 2006-60").
- **Section Repealing the Regulation**: Section 5 of SI 2006-60 explicitly **repeals** the referenced regulation.

### What This Means:

- The regulation previously existed as a legal provision, likely governing a specific area such as environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, or administrative procedures.
- However, due to changes in policy, legislative reform, or redundancy, it was determined to be obsolete or superseded.
- The repeal by SI 2006-60, section 5, means that **no legal effect** remains for that regulation. Any references to it in current law, legal proceedings, or administrative practice are now outdated or invalid.

- The fact that the regulation is listed four times in your input suggests it may have been a repeated reference in a document or database, possibly indicating a formatting or indexing error, but the legal consequence remains the same: **it is repealed**.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active or currently applicable regulation** under the reference in question. The regulation was **officially removed from the law** by **Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2006-60**, which came into force in June 2006.
