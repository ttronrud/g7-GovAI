### **Overview**
This by-law establishes an **exemption from deposit insurance** for certain deposits made by **federal member financial institutions** (e.g., banks, credit unions) from specific types of entities or organizations. These deposits are referred to as **"prescribed deposits"** and are exempt from CDIC insurance coverage under the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*.

The exemption applies only to **first deposit transactions** involving such prescribed deposits and is intended to support the financial operations of public, governmental, and institutional entities that require access to banking services without the risk of being covered by deposit insurance—thereby avoiding potential conflicts of interest or financial instability.

The by-law comes into force upon registration with the government.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act* (CDIC Act). This is the primary legislation governing CDIC's mandate, including deposit insurance, risk management, and exemptions.

2. **Deposit**  
   Defined as the meaning of "deposit" in the *Schedule to the CDIC Act*, **but excluding** the specific exclusions found in subsections 2(2), (5), and (6) of that schedule.  
   → This means the definition is based on standard deposit categories (e.g., savings, term deposits), without excluding certain types of deposits that might otherwise be excluded under the Act.

3. **Entity**  
   Has the same meaning as defined in **Section 2 of the Bank Act**.  
   → Includes corporations, trusts, government bodies, and other legal entities recognized under Canadian banking law.

4. **First Deposit Transaction**  
   The initial deposit transaction between a person (the depositor) and a **federal member institution** (e.g., a Canadian bank) that has submitted an application under **Section 26.02 of the CDIC Act**.  
   → This transaction can occur **before or after** the institution files the application.  
   → The exemption applies only to the **first** such transaction with a prescribed deposit.

### **Key Provisions and Implications**

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Exemption Scope** | Only applies to **first deposit transactions** with prescribed deposits. Subsequent deposits from the same entity are not automatically exempt. |
| **Application Requirement** | The federal member institution must have formally applied under **Section 26.02** of the CDIC Act to qualify for this exemption. |
| **No Insurance Coverage** | The prescribed deposit is **not covered** by CDIC deposit insurance. This means the deposit is not protected in the event of the institution’s insolvency. |
| **Purpose** | To allow federal and institutional entities to access banking services (e.g., lending, foreign exchange, securities) without the risk of deposit insurance exposure, which could create conflicts or inefficiencies. |
| **Exclusion of Debt Obligations** | In the securities category, only **non-debt securities** are included. Debt obligations issued by the institution itself are excluded. |

### **Effective Date**
- The by-law comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate authority (typically the Governor in Council or the Minister of Finance).

---

### **Regulatory Context and Rationale**

This exemption is part of the CDIC’s broader framework to balance **financial stability**, **public interest**, and **operational flexibility**. It allows:

- **Government entities** and **international organizations** to maintain liquidity and access to banking services without being subject to deposit insurance, which could complicate risk assessment or create moral hazard.
- **Large institutional investors** (e.g., pension funds, mutual funds) to use banking services efficiently without the added risk of insurance exposure.
- **Financial institutions** to serve specialized clients (e.g., foreign governments, international agencies) in ways that support national economic and diplomatic objectives.

However, the exemption **does not extend to all deposits**—only to the **first transaction** with a prescribed entity, and only if the transaction serves a specific financial service.

---

### **Limitations and Risks**

- **No insurance protection**: Depositors (e.g., government bodies or pension funds) bear full risk if the institution fails.
- **Limited to first transaction**: Subsequent deposits from the same entity may still be subject to insurance.
- **No automatic extension**: The exemption is not permanent; it depends on ongoing compliance with the conditions (e.g., revenue thresholds, asset levels).
- **Potential for misuse**: Could be exploited if entities use the exemption to circumvent insurance requirements.

---

### **Conclusion**

This by-law provides a **targeted, conditional exemption** from CDIC deposit insurance for specific types of deposits involving government, international, or large institutional entities. It enables federal and public institutions to access banking services essential to economic and financial operations while preserving the integrity of the deposit insurance system by limiting coverage to ordinary retail and consumer deposits.

It reflects a pragmatic approach to financial regulation, balancing the need for access to banking services with the need to maintain financial stability and risk control.

**Final Note:**  
This by-law is a **regulatory tool** under the authority of the CDIC Board of Directors and is designed to support national policy goals in areas such as international cooperation, public finance, and financial inclusion—without compromising the core function of deposit insurance for individual savers.
