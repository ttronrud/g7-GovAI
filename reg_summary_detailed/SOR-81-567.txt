### **Detailed Summary of the Fort Smith Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Citation**
The **Fort Smith Airport Zoning Regulations** are formally approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**.  
These regulations are officially cited as:  
> *The Fort Smith Airport Zoning Regulations.*

This legislative instrument establishes specific spatial and elevation controls around the Fort Smith Airport in the **Northwest Territories (NWT)** to ensure aviation safety, particularly by minimizing hazards such as obstacles, bird attraction, and uncontrolled structures near runways and approach paths.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to the Fort Smith Airport, located in the vicinity of Fort Smith, NWT. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precisely defined geographic point used as a datum for all elevation and boundary calculations. It is located at the intersection of the centerlines of runways 01–19 and 11–29, with specific directional measurements (see below). |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (for runways 01, 19, 11, and 29). These surfaces define safe zones for aircraft during approach and landing. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located at a constant elevation of **45.7 meters above the ARP**, unless this would place it below 9.1 meters above ground level—then it is set at **9.1 meters above ground**. This surface defines the upper boundary of all zoning restrictions. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, including runways and their extensions. Includes both active runway areas and approach zones. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending outward from the lateral edges of each strip and its associated approach surfaces, rising at a 1:7 slope (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal), until it intersects the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

---

#### **3. Assigned Elevation**
- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is fixed at **203 meters above sea level**.  
- All other surfaces (approach, transitional, outer) are referenced relative to this point.

---

#### **4. Applicability of the Regulations**
The regulations apply to all lands—public or private—that fall within:
- The **land within the designated outer limits** (as defined in Part II of the schedule), and  
- The **land directly beneath any portion of an approach surface** that extends beyond the outer limits.

This includes public road allowances and adjacent private properties.

---

#### **5. Prohibited Activities (Elevation Restrictions)**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or expand any **building, structure, or object** (including natural growths)  
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:
  - The **approach surface**
  - The **outer surface**
  - The **transitional surface**

> This restriction ensures that no object—whether man-made or natural—creates a hazard during aircraft approach or landing.

---

#### **6. Management of Natural Growth**
If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds the elevation of any of the three defined surfaces:
- The **Minister of Transport** may issue a formal direction requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision prevents vegetation from becoming a flight hazard due to height or bird-attracting properties.

---

#### **7. Prohibition on Waste Accumulation**
No owner or occupier may:
- Use any land under these regulations for the **disposal or accumulation of waste, materials, or substances** that are:
  - **Edible** or  
  - **Attractive to birds**

> This rule is critical for preventing bird strikes, which pose a serious threat to aircraft safety.

#### **8. Description of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

The ARP is defined geometrically:
> Start at the intersection of the centerlines of runways **01–19** and **11–29**.  
> Then:
> - Proceed **northeasterly** along the centerline of runway 01–19 for **91.4 meters**  
> - Then **southeasterly** parallel to the centerline of runway 11–29 for **91.4 meters**

This point serves as the origin for all elevation and boundary calculations.

---

#### **9. Outer Limits of the Zoning Area (Boundary Description)**

The outer limits of the regulated zone are defined by a complex, multi-segmented boundary that follows:
- A **circle of radius 3,962.4 meters** centered at the ARP
- Shorelines and road boundaries
- Property lines from various land plans (C.L.S.R. = Crown Land Survey Record)

**Key segments of the boundary:**
1. Begins at the **northwesterly boundary of Lot 207, Plan 40391** where it intersects the circle.
2. Travels **clockwise along the circumference** of the circle to intersect the **northeasterly boundary of Lot 54, Plan 38702**.
3. Follows the **sinuous shoreline of the Slave River** (which forms the northeasterly boundaries of Lots 54, 53, 52, and 51).
4. Proceeds **southwesterly** along the boundary of Lot 51 and across several roads (Plans 39486, 43395, McDougal Road) to the **northwesterly corner of Lot 920, Plan 58490**.
5. Continues **southeasterly** along the northeasterly boundaries of Lots 920, 921, and 47 (remainder) to the **northeasterly corner of Lot 47**.
6. Moves **southeasterly** to the **northwesterly corner of Lot “A”, Plan 40873**.
7. Proceeds **southwesterly** along the boundaries of Lots A, G, 186, and 684 to the **southwesterly corner of Lot 684**.
8. Moves **southwesterly** to the **northwesterly corner of Lot 830, Plan 56050**.
9. Follows the northwesterly boundaries of Lots 830, 829, and 510 (with street production) to the **southwesterly corner of Lot 510**.
10. Travels **southeasterly** along the southerly boundary of Lot 510 to intersect the **northwesterly boundary of Lot 187–3, Plan 56354**.
11. Proceeds **southwesterly** along the northwesterly boundaries of Lots 187–3 and 709 to the **northerly boundary of Road Plan 50774**.
12. Moves **northwesterly** along the northerly boundary of Road 50774 to its intersection with the original circle.
13. Travels **southwesterly** along the circle back to the **southerly boundary of Lot 209, Plan 40391**.
14. Proceeds **easterly** along the southerly boundary of Lot 209 to its southeasterly corner.
15. Then **northwesterly** along the northeasterly boundary of Lot 209 to its northeasterly corner.
16. Finally, moves **northeasterly** along the northwesterly boundaries of Lots 208 and 207 back to the **starting point**.

This boundary forms a large, irregular zone encompassing a significant area surrounding the airport.

#### **10. Approach Surfaces (Runway End Zones)**

Each approach surface is a **tilted plane** extending from the end of a runway strip, designed to ensure aircraft have a clear path during descent.

| Runway | Surface Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Runway 01 (approach 01)** | - Ratio: 1:40 (1 m vertical per 40 m horizontal)<br>- Rises to a horizontal line 76.2 m above the end of the strip<br>- Horizontal distance: 3,048 m from end of strip<br>- Outer ends of line: 381 m from runway centerline |
| **Runway 19 (approach 19)** | - Same as approach 01 (1:40 ratio, 76.2 m, 3,048 m, 381 m from centerline) |
| **Runway 11 (approach 11)** | - Ratio: 1:50 (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal)<br>- Rises to 304.8 m above end of strip<br>- Horizontal distance: 15,240 m<br>- Outer ends: 2,438.4 m from center
