### **Detailed Summary of the Kindersley Airport Zoning Regulations (1991)**

The **Kindersley Airport Zoning Regulations**, enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, are a set of legally binding rules designed to ensure the safety and operational efficiency of Kindersley Airport in Saskatchewan. These regulations establish spatial and elevation restrictions around the airport to prevent hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases. The regulations were developed after a public consultation period and approved by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport.

## **1. Legal Basis and Publication Process**

- **Section 5.5 of the Aeronautics Act** required that a proposed version of the zoning regulations be published in both:
  - *Canada Gazette, Part I* (official federal publication), on **December 15 and 22, 1990**, and
  - *Kindersley Clarion* (local newspaper), on **January 23 and 30, 1991**.
  
- This publication provided **a reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., landowners, aviation stakeholders, local communities) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

- Based on this public input, the **Minister of Transport recommended** the adoption of the regulations, which were then formally adopted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.

## **2. Title and Scope**

- **Title**: The regulations are officially known as the *Kindersley Airport Zoning Regulations*.
- **Applicability**: They apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Kindersley Airport**, including public road allowances, as specifically described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

> These regulations define a protected zone around the airport to ensure safe flight operations by controlling the physical characteristics of the land within that zone.

## **3. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined within the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Kindersley Airport, located near the town of Kindersley, Saskatchewan. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point used as a datum for elevation measurements. Located on the centerline of Runway 07–25, 533.5 meters from the end of Runway 25. Its elevation is **689.5 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (Runway 07–25). It rises at a **1:30 slope** (1 meter vertically per 30 meters horizontally) to a horizontal line 2,500 meters from the runway end. The outer ends of this line are 295 meters from the runway centerline. The top of this surface is **83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the airport reference point** (i.e., 689.5 + 45 = 734.5 m above sea level). However, if this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground level, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to avoid impracticality. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area, specifically the **90-meter-wide, 1,187-meter-long** runway associated with Runway 07–25. It is divided into 45 meters on each side of the centerline. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it intersects with the outer surface. |

## **4. Prohibitions and Restrictions**

### **(a) Building and Structure Elevation Limits**

- **No person may erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (or add to an existing one) on land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

> This means that all structures—whether permanent or temporary—must remain below these defined imaginary planes to avoid interference with aircraft during approach or departure.

### **(b) Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes, grasses) on regulated land exceeds any of the above surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister may require** the owner or occupier to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This provision ensures that vegetation does not create visual or physical obstructions that could compromise flight safety.

### **(c) Waste Disposal Restrictions**

- No owner or occupier may **use land for the disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible by birds**, or
  - **Attractive to birds**.

> This restriction is critical to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation hazard. Waste such as food scraps, garbage, or organic matter can attract birds to the airport area, increasing the risk of collisions with aircraft.

## **5. Geographical Boundaries of the Regulated Area**

The outer limits of the regulated zone are defined in a detailed, legal boundary description based on **sectional survey lines and road allowances** in the Township and Range system of Saskatchewan.

### **Boundary Description (Summary)**

The boundary begins at the **northeast corner of Section 35, Township 29, Range 23, West of the Third Meridian**, and proceeds in a series of directional segments:

1. South along the eastern limits of Sections 35, 26, and parts of Section 23.
2. West along the southern boundary of the northeast quarter of Section 23.
3. South along the eastern boundary of the southwest quarter of Section 23.
4. West across the southern boundary of Section 23 and intervening road allowances to Section 15.
5. South along the eastern boundary of the northeast quarter of Section 15.
6. West along the southern boundaries of Sections 15, 16, 17 and road allowances to the southwest corner of Section 17.
7. North along the western boundary of the northwest quarter of Section 17.
8. West across road allowance to the southeast quarter of Section 19.
9. North along the western boundary of the southeast quarter of Section 19.
10. West along the southern boundary of the northwest quarter of Section 19.
11. North along the western boundaries of Sections 19, 30, 31, and the southwest quarter of Section 6 (Township 30, Range 23).
12. East along the northern boundary of the southwest quarter of Section 6.
13. North along the western boundary of the northeast quarter of Section 6.
14. East across road allowance to the southwest corner of Section 8.
15. North along the western boundary of the southwest quarter of Section 8.
16. East across the southern halves of Sections 8, 9, 10 and road allowances to the northeast corner of the southeast quarter of Section 10.
17. South along the eastern boundary of the southeast quarter of Section 10.
18. East across road allowance to the northeast corner of the northwest quarter of Section 2.
19. South along the eastern boundary of the northwest quarter of Section 2.
20. East along the northern boundary of the southeast quarter of Section 2.
21. South along the eastern boundary of the southeast quarter of Section 2 and across road allowance back to the **point of commencement**.

> This boundary defines a large, irregularly shaped zone encompassing surrounding land and road allowances, ensuring comprehensive protection around the airport.

## **6. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

- To **prevent obstacles** (buildings, trees, structures) from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- To **maintain visual flight rules (VFR)** and **instrument flight rules (IFR)** safety by ensuring clear flight paths.
- To **minimize bird hazard** by prohibiting waste disposal that attracts birds.
- To provide a **consistent, enforceable standard** for land use around the airport, based on established aviation safety principles.

---

## **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with elevation and waste disposal rules.
- Violations may lead to **fines, orders to remove structures**, or other legal remedies.
- Compliance is monitored through **inspections, aerial surveys, and reporting mechanisms**.

---

## **8. Connection to Existing Zoning Plan**

The regulations are directly derived from **Kindersley Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2713**, dated **February 23, 1989**, which:
- Defines the runway layout (07–25),
- Specifies the approach, transitional, and outer surfaces,
- Establishes the physical boundaries of the regulated area.

Thus, these regulations are not arbitrary—they are a formal legal implementation of a pre-existing, publicly reviewed, and professionally developed aviation zoning plan.
