**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulatory instrument, issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, formally designates the **Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada** as a **"department"** and assigns the **Prime Minister** as the **"appropriate Minister"** for the purposes of the Act. The designation is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.

### 1. **Legal Basis**
The regulation is grounded in **paragraph (b) of the definition "department"** in **Section 2 of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision defines what constitutes a "department" for administrative and financial purposes. Specifically, the Act allows for a body to be designated as a department if it is established by a statute or by order of the Governor General in Council, and if it carries out functions that are similar to those of a department of the Government of Canada.

Additionally, the regulation invokes **paragraph (b) of the definition "appropriate Minister"** in **Section 2 of the Financial Administration Act**, which provides that an "appropriate Minister" is a Minister of the Crown who has responsibility for a particular body or function. This designation establishes the Prime Minister as the responsible minister for the Commission of Inquiry.

### 2. **Key Designations**

- **Designation as a Department**:  
  The **Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada** is officially recognized as a **department** under the Financial Administration Act. This classification is significant because it grants the Commission certain administrative and financial attributes typically associated with government departments, such as:
  - Access to government funding or financial authority (subject to applicable rules);
  - The ability to operate under the financial administration framework of the federal government;
  - Formal status in government records and reporting structures;
  - Eligibility for certain procurement, budgeting, and oversight procedures.

- **Designation of the Prime Minister as the Appropriate Minister**:  
  The **Prime Minister** is formally designated as the **appropriate Minister** with respect to the Commission. This means:
  - The Prime Minister is responsible for overseeing the Commission’s operations and ensuring compliance with federal financial and administrative rules;
  - The Prime Minister has the authority to provide directions, approve expenditures, or intervene in matters related to the Commission’s mandate;
  - The Commission may be subject to reporting requirements to the Prime Minister or to the Office of the Prime Minister, depending on the structure of the inquiry;
  - It establishes a formal line of accountability between the Commission and the highest level of government.

### 3. **Purpose and Context**
This designation is likely part of a broader effort to:
- Provide the Commission with the necessary **legal and administrative standing** to conduct its inquiry effectively;
- Ensure that the Commission operates under a **clear chain of accountability** and financial oversight;
- Facilitate access to government resources, including budgetary support or interdepartmental coordination;
- Enable the Commission to be treated as a formal government entity in financial and administrative processes, even though it is an inquiry body (not a permanent department).

The Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada was established to investigate systemic issues within Canada’s blood supply system—such as safety, transparency, accountability, and governance—potentially including concerns related to blood safety, donor practices, or regulatory oversight.

### 4. **Implications**

- The Commission remains **independent in its investigations** and is not subject to the same day-to-day administrative control as a regular department.
- The designation is **limited in scope** to the purposes of the Financial Administration Act—primarily financial administration, budgeting, and reporting.
