### 🔹 Scope of Application
These regulations apply to:
- **Distribution undertakings** (e.g., cable, satellite providers) that are **licensed** to distribute television programming.
- **Excluded** from the scope:
  - Subscription television systems (e.g., pay-per-view services),
  - Relay distribution undertakings (repeaters),

---

### 🔹 Who Can Request Deletion and Substitution?

The **operator of a Canadian television station** may request a licensee (a distribution provider) to:
1. **Delete** a programming service (either Canadian or non-Canadian), and
2. **Substitute** it with a programming service from:
   - A **local television station**, or
   - A **regional television station**.

#### Specific Requests by Distribution Type:

| Distribution Type | Request Type |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Terrestrial distribution** (cable) | Delete any programming service (Canadian or non-Canadian) and substitute it with a **local or regional** Canadian station. |
| **DTH (satellite)** | - Delete a **non-Canadian** programming service and substitute it with a **Canadian** station; <br> - For subscribers in **Grade B official contour** or **noise-limited bounding contour**, delete another **Canadian** station and substitute it with the Canadian station's programming. |

> Note: Grade B contours are areas where signal reception is limited due to terrain or interference; noise-limited contours are areas where signal quality is degraded.

---

### 🔹 Conditions for Compliance (When a Licensee Must Act)

A licensee **must** carry out the deletion and substitution **if**:
1. The request is in **writing** and received by the licensee **at least four days before** the scheduled broadcast of the substituted programming.
2. The programming to be **deleted** and **substituted** are **comparable** and will be **broadcast simultaneously**.
3. The substituted programming has the **same format or a higher format** than the deleted service.
4. *(For terrestrial distribution only)* The substituted programming has a **higher priority** under **Section 17 of the Broadcasting Distribution Regulations** than the deleted service.

> Section 17 prioritizes programming based on factors like public interest, regional relevance, and educational value.

---

### 🔹 What Happens If the Request Is Late?

If the request is **not received within the four-day window** but still meets all the above conditions (comparable, simultaneous, same or better format, and priority), the licensee **may still carry out** the deletion and substitution — **except** as otherwise restricted by the regulations or the licensee’s license conditions.

> This provides some flexibility but does not remove the requirement for compliance with core standards.

---

### 🔹 Public Interest Safeguard

- A licensee **cannot** delete a programming service and substitute another **if the CRTC determines under subsection 18(3) of the Broadcasting Act** that such action is **not in the public interest**.
- The CRTC has the authority to block any deletion/substitution that undermines public access to diverse programming or harms viewers’ interests.

---

### 🔹 Agreement Between Parties

- The **licensee** and the **operator of the local or regional station** may **agree** to have the operator carry out the deletion and substitution.
- This allows for more coordinated and efficient implementation.

---

### 🔹 Priority Rules for Multiple Requests

- If a **terrestrial distribution licensee** receives **multiple deletion/substitution requests** from different Canadian television station operators:
  - The licensee must **give preference** to the programming service of the station with the **highest priority** under **Section 17** of the *Broadcasting Distribution Regulations*.

> This ensures that services with greater public value (e.g., educational, community-focused) are prioritized.

---

### 🔹 Discontinuation of Deletion/Substitution

- A licensee may **discontinue** a deletion and substitution **if**:
  - The deleted and substituted programming services are **no longer comparable**, or
  - They are **no longer broadcast simultaneously**.

> This allows for dynamic adjustments in response to changing programming needs or technical issues.

---

### 🔹 Due Diligence and Service Quality

- A licensee must **exercise due diligence** to ensure that:
  - The deletion and substitution do **not result in errors** (e.g., dropped signals, audio/video glitches).
  - The transition causes **only minimal disruption** to subscribers.

> This is a key responsibility to protect viewer experience.

---

### 🔹 Compensation for Errors

- If the CRTC determines that:
  - A licensee **deleted and substituted** a programming service in a way that resulted in **recurring substantial errors**, and
  - The licensee **failed to exercise due diligence** to prevent those errors,
  
👉 The licensee must **compensate its customers**.

> **What constitutes an error?**
- The deletion and substitution are **not carried out simultaneously**, OR
- The **video or audio components** of the programming are **affected** (e.g., distortion, missing content).

> Compensation is not automatic — it only applies when the licensee’s actions (or inaction) led to significant, repeated technical failures.

---

### 🔹 Amendments and Enforcement
- The regulations include several **amendments** (though not detailed in the text), likely to refine implementation or address feedback from stakeholders.
- Enforcement is carried out by the **CRTC**, which may intervene if a deletion/substitution violates public interest or technical standards.

---

### 🔹 Effective Date
- These regulations **come into force on December 1, 2015**.

## ✅ Summary in Plain Language

This regulation gives **Canadian broadcasters** the ability to ask cable or satellite providers to:
- Remove a non-Canadian or foreign channel,
- Replace it with a **local or regional Canadian channel** (e.g., a community station or regional network),
- Especially when that local channel is better suited to local viewers.

But it comes with **strict rules**:
- Requests must be in writing and submitted at least **four days in advance**.
- The replacement service must be **similar or better in quality** and **broadcast at the same time**.
- The change must not harm the public interest (as judged by the CRTC).
- Providers must **minimize errors** and **compensate customers** if they cause repeated technical problems.

It also ensures that **local and regional content** (especially educational or community-based programming) is given priority over
