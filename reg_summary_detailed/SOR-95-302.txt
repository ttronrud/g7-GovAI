The Order is issued under the authority of **paragraph 29(1)(a) of the Territorial Lands Act** (Canada).  
- It is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.

### **2. Official Title and Citation**
The Order is officially titled:  
**Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1995, No. 2**  
This designation allows for legal reference and citation in future land-related proceedings or records.

---

### **3. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose is to **authorize a specific employee of the Government of Canada** to acquire a **limited interest in territorial land** within the Northwest Territories.  
- The acquisition is **not for commercial development or residential use**, but rather for **personal or professional use**—specifically, the establishment of a **trapper’s cabin**.  
- The employee is granted the right to **lease** the land, not to own it outright, under conditions that are consistent with government land use policies.

---

### **4. Authorized Employee**
The employee named in the Order is:  
- **George Douglas Lennie**  
- **Position**: Hydrometric Survey Technician, Water Survey of Canada  
- **Department**: Department of the Environment (now part of Environment and Climate Change Canada)  
- **Location**: Town of Inuvik, Northwest Territories  

This individual is a government employee whose professional duties involve hydrological and environmental survey work in northern Canada. The land acquisition is thus tied to his professional responsibilities in the region.

---

### **5. Land Description and Location**
The parcel of land authorized is located in the **Mackenzie Delta region** of the Northwest Territories, with the following precise details:

- **Location**:  
  - 10 air kilometers **west of Inuvik**  
  - On an **unnamed channel** of the **20 river kilometers upstream from Oniak Channel**  
  - Coordinates: Approximately **68°20′ North Latitude** and **133°58′ West Longitude**  
- **Land Division**:  
  - Quad number: **107 B/7**  
- **Reference**: The parcel is shown in **red on a sketch plan** (file number: **33-1-12**) held in the **Land Management Division** of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) in Ottawa.  
  - This provides a formal, documented record of the land boundaries and ensures transparency and traceability.

---

### **6. Nature of the Interest**
- The employee is authorized to **lease** the land, not to purchase or hold ownership.  
- The lease is for the purpose of establishing and operating a **trapper’s cabin**, which is consistent with traditional Indigenous and northern subsistence practices.  
- This reflects a recognition of the need for government personnel to have access to remote land for operational or research purposes, while respecting land use norms in northern Canada.

---

### **7. Exceptions and Reservations**
Crucially, the Order **excludes and reserves** the following rights and interests:

- **All mines and minerals**, including:  
  - Solid minerals (e.g., gold, diamonds, base metals)  
  - Liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons (e.g., oil, natural gas)  
- The government **retains the right to work** these resources, meaning:  
  - No exploration, extraction, or development of minerals or hydrocarbons is permitted on the parcel.  
  - Any future mineral rights or claims are held by the Crown (Government of Canada).  

This reservation ensures that the land remains under Crown control for resource development and protects against private exploitation.

---

### **8. Legal and Policy Implications**
- **Compliance with Territorial Lands Act**: The Order adheres strictly to statutory provisions, particularly those governing land use by government employees.  
- **Public Interest and Efficiency**: Allows a government employee to access land necessary for field operations (e.g., surveying, monitoring) in remote regions.  
- **Respect for Indigenous and Northern Land Use Norms**: The trapper’s cabin use aligns with traditional land use patterns in the NWT, particularly in the Mackenzie Delta, where such cabins are often used by Indigenous communities and government personnel.  
- **Environmental and Cultural Sensitivity**: The reservation of mineral rights demonstrates a balance between enabling operational access and protecting natural resources and potential Indigenous rights.

---

### **9. Recordkeeping and Oversight**
- The land parcel is formally documented in government records (file 33-1-12), ensuring accountability and auditability.  
- The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development maintains oversight of land use and land titles in the NWT, reinforcing institutional responsibility.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1995, No. 2** is a legally binding instrument that authorizes **George Douglas Lennie**, a government survey technician, to **lease a specific parcel of land** in the Mackenzie Delta for the purpose of operating a trapper’s cabin. The Order is grounded in statutory authority, respects Indigenous and environmental considerations, and clearly reserves all mineral rights for the Crown. It exemplifies a targeted, transparent, and responsible approach to land use by government employees in remote northern regions of Canada.
