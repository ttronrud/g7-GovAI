**Detailed Summary of the *West Coast Shipping Employees Hours of Work Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**West Coast Shipping Employees Hours of Work Regulations**  
It may be cited as such and applies specifically to maritime workers employed on ships operating from ports in the Province of British Columbia.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to *Part III of the Canada Labour Code* (Loi), which governs labor standards in Canada, including working hours, rest periods, and overtime. These regulations modify certain provisions of this part for seafarers.

- **Employee**: A person employed on board a ship that falls under the definition in **Section 3 of the Act** — typically vessels engaged in shipping operations, especially those operating from or through British Columbia.

- **Employer**: Any individual or entity that employs one or more employees on a ship.

- **Lay-day**: A paid day off work to which an employee is entitled after working a specified number of days at sea. It is a key mechanism for ensuring rest and work-life balance for seafarers.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations **modify sections 169 and 171 of the Canada Labour Code** — which normally regulate working hours and rest periods — to apply to specific classes of employees working on ships operated by undertakings or businesses within the legislative authority of Parliament (i.e., commercial shipping operations) that operate from any port in **British Columbia**.

This means that the standard labor hour rules (such as maximum daily or weekly working hours) are adjusted to accommodate the unique nature of maritime work, including long voyages, irregular schedules, and operational demands.

---

### **4. Working Hours – Two Distinct Categories of Employees**

The regulations distinguish between two types of seafarers based on their entitlement to lay-days, which determines their maximum working hours:

#### **Category 1: Employees Entitled to 1.13 Lay-days per Day (Working 12 Hours)**  
- **Entitlement**: For every day worked (on board the ship), the employee earns **1.13 lay-days** if they work **12 hours per day**.
- **Maximum Daily Hours**:  
  - May work **up to 12 hours per day**.
- **Maximum Weekly Hours**:  
  - May exceed 40 hours per week (i.e., no strict weekly cap).
- **Prohibited Practice**:  
  - Employers **cannot cause or permit** employees to work more than 12 hours in any single day.
- **Purpose**: This category typically applies to **key crew members** (e.g., officers or senior ratings) who have greater responsibilities and are entitled to more rest.

> Example: A crew member working 12 hours per day earns 1.13 lay-days per day — meaning they get 1.13 days off for every day at sea.

---

#### **Category 2: Employees Entitled to 0.4 Lay-days per Day (Working 8 Hours)**  
- **Entitlement**: For every day worked, the employee earns **0.4 lay-days** if they work **8 hours per day**.
- **Maximum Daily Hours**:  
  - May work **up to 8 hours per day**.
- **Maximum Weekly Hours**:  
  - May exceed 40 hours per week (no strict weekly limit).
- **Prohibited Practice**:  
  - Employers **cannot cause or permit** employees to work more than 8 hours in any single day.
- **Purpose**: This category typically applies to **lower-tier or support staff** (e.g., deckhands, engineers, or general laborers) with less intensive duties.

> Example: An employee working 8 hours per day earns 0.4 lay-days per day — meaning they get 0.4 days off for every day at sea.

---

### **5. Lay-Day Accumulation Limit**

- **General Rule**:  
  No employee in either category may accumulate **more than 45 lay-days** during any period.

- **Exception for Exceptional Circumstances**:  
  If it is **established to the satisfaction of the Head of Compliance and Enforcement** that an accumulation exceeding 45 lay-days is **reasonable due to exceptional circumstances** (e.g., severe weather, emergencies, or extended voyages), the Head of Compliance and Enforcement may issue a **permit** allowing the accumulation of more than 45 lay-days **for a specific period**.

> This provides flexibility in rare or unforeseen situations where crew rest is disrupted due to operational necessity.

---

### **6. Overtime Limits**

- **General Overtime Cap (within a 7-day period)**:
  - For employees in **Category 1** (working 12 hours/day):  
    → **Maximum 18 hours of overtime** in any **seven consecutive working days**.
  - For employees in **Category 2** (working 8 hours/day):  
    → **Maximum 12 hours of overtime** in any **seven consecutive working days**.

- **Proportionality Rule (for periods not equal to 7 days)**:  
  If an employee works **more or fewer than seven consecutive working days**, the maximum overtime allowed must be adjusted **proportionally**.  
  > Example: If an employee works 10 consecutive days, the total overtime allowed would be:  
  > (10 ÷ 7) × 18 hours (for Category 1) or (10 ÷ 7) × 12 hours (for Category 2).

- **Adjustment for Reduced Daily Hours Due to Loading/Unloading**:  
  If, during a working day, an employee is **relieved of duty** due to **loading or unloading operations** and their daily working hours are reduced, the **total overtime allowed** in that 7-day period is **increased by the number of hours saved**.

> Example: An employee normally works 12 hours but is relieved of 2 hours during a day due to unloading. That 2-hour reduction counts as an "extra" overtime allowance, effectively increasing their total allowable overtime for the week.

> This rule supports operational flexibility during port activities without violating overtime limits.

---

### **7. Flexibility in Scheduling (Key Provision)**

- **Hours may be scheduled and actually worked without regard to Section 173 of the Canada Labour Code**.  
  → Section 173 of the Act typically prohibits work schedules that violate standard working hours (e.g., working more than 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week).  
  → However, **these regulations override that restriction** for seafarers on vessels operating in British Columbia.

> This is a critical exception that allows for the **real-world realities of shipping operations**, such as irregular shifts, long voyages, and port-specific demands.

---

### **8. Overall Purpose and Intent**

These regulations aim to:

- **Balance maritime operational needs** with employee well-being.
- **Ensure fair rest periods** through the lay-day system.
- **Allow flexibility in working hours** while still protecting seafarers from excessive or unsafe working conditions.
- **Provide practical mechanisms** (such as overtime adjustments and lay-day permits) to handle exceptional situations without compromising safety or labor standards.
