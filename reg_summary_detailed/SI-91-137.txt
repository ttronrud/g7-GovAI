**Detailed Summary of the "Residents of India Remission Order" (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Residents of India Remission Order* is a Canadian government regulation issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (specifically subsection 23(2)). It provides a mechanism for the remission (i.e., cancellation or reduction) of income tax, interest, and penalties that certain Indian residents owe to Canada on royalties or fees received from Canada for technical services.

This Order was enacted in 1991 and is designed to promote tax fairness and compliance with a bilateral tax agreement between Canada and India, particularly in cases where the tax treatment of such income differs due to the differing tax rates specified in the agreement.

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- **Issuing Body**: His Excellency the Governor General in Council (the formal authority to issue regulations in Canada).
- **Recommendation**: Made on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.
- **Statutory Authority**: Subsection 23(2) of the *Financial Administration Act*, which allows the government to make regulations for the purpose of remission of taxes when it is in the public interest.
- **Citation**: The Order may be cited as the *Residents of India Remission Order*.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**: Refers to the *Income Tax Act* of Canada, which governs the taxation of individuals and entities in Canada.

2. **Agreement**: Refers to the *Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of India for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income*, set out in Schedule III to Chapter 7 of the *Statutes of Canada, 1986*. This is commonly known as the **Canada-India Double Taxation Agreement (DTA)**.

3. **Person**: Defined as any individual or entity that qualifies as a "resident of India" under **Paragraph 1(c) of Article 3** of the Agreement. This typically includes individuals who are ordinarily resident in India, regardless of nationality.

4. **Remission**: The cancellation or refund of income tax, interest, and penalties that a person would otherwise owe under the *Income Tax Act*.

---

### **Scope and Applicability**

The remission applies to **residents of India** (as defined in the Agreement) who receive:

1. **Royalties** — in respect of a right or property that was granted **after December 12, 1988**, or  
2. **Fees for technical services** — under a contract that was **signed after December 12, 1988**.

These payments are made by or on behalf of Canada to individuals or entities in India.

### **Conditions for Remission**

Remission is granted only when the **amount of taxes, interest, and penalties actually payable** under the *Income Tax Act* exceeds the amount that would have been payable **if the tax rate in the Agreement had been 20% instead of 30%**.

#### **Detailed Calculation of Remission Amount**

Let:
- **A** = The total amount of income tax, interest, and penalties payable under the *Income Tax Act* on the royalty or technical service fee received.
- **B** = The total amount of income tax, interest, and penalties that would have been payable **if the 30% rate in Article 13(2) of the Agreement had been interpreted as a 20% rate**.

Then:
> **Remission Amount = A – B**

In other words, the remission is the **difference** between what the person would have actually paid under the current tax regime and what they would have paid if the tax rate had been reduced from 30% to 20% under the DTA.

---

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

- The Order addresses a **discrepancy in tax treatment** between the actual tax rate applied in Canada (30%) and the rate that India may consider fair or appropriate under the DTA (which includes a 20% rate for certain types of income).
- By remitting the excess tax, the government acknowledges that the 30% rate in the Agreement may be **disproportionate** or **unfair** in certain cases, especially when the income is derived from technical services or royalties.
- The remission supports **tax equity** and **international cooperation**, aligning Canada’s tax treatment with the spirit of the DTA, which aims to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion.
- It is in the **public interest** to ensure that residents of India are not unduly burdened by tax obligations when they provide services to Canada, especially in a context of international economic cooperation.

### **Key Implications**

1. **Tax Relief**: Indian residents who receive royalties or technical service fees from Canada after December 12, 1988, may receive a refund or reduction of tax, interest, and penalties if the difference between a 30% and 20% tax rate results in overpayment.

2. **Triggering Event**: The remission applies only to income received or credited **after December 12, 1988** — a significant date marking the start of the period when the DTA was implemented.

3. **No Retroactive Application**: The Order does not apply to income received before December 12, 1988.

4. **No Automatic Refund**: The remission is not automatic. It must be claimed and processed through the appropriate tax administration channels, likely requiring documentation of the income, the contract, and the tax liability.

5. **Alignment with DTA**: The Order reflects a **pragmatic interpretation** of the DTA, where a provision (Article 13(2)) that refers to a 30% tax rate is read in a way that is more favorable to the recipient (India) — effectively treating it as a 20% rate.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission applies only to **royalties or fees for technical services**.
- It does **not** apply to other types of income (e.g., dividends, capital gains, or business profits).
- The remission applies only to **taxes, interest, and penalties** — not to the principal tax liability itself.
- The remission is limited to the **excess** over the 20% rate calculation — not a full refund or waiver.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Residents of India Remission Order* is a targeted and equitable regulatory measure that:

- Provides tax relief to Indian residents who receive income from Canada for technical services or royalties after December 12, 1988,
- Corrects a perceived over-taxation by adjusting the effective rate under the Canada-India Double Taxation Agreement from 30% to 20%,
- Is grounded in the public interest and international tax cooperation,
- Promotes fairness and compliance with bilateral tax treaties.

It serves as a practical tool to ensure that tax treatment under the DTA is not only legally sound but also economically and socially equitable for cross-border service providers.
