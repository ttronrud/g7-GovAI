### **Regulation Summary: Designation of the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada as a Department under the Financial Administration Act**

#### **Legal Authority and Context**
This regulation is issued under the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, a key piece of Canadian federal legislation that governs the financial management, accountability, and administrative structure of federal departments and agencies.

Specifically, the regulation is based on two provisions in **section 2** of the Financial Administration Act:
- **Paragraph (b)a**: Defines the term *“department”* to include any body or organization that is designated as a department for the purposes of the Act.
- **Paragraph (b)b**: Defines the term *“appropriate Minister”* as the minister responsible for overseeing a designated body or organization.

The regulation is formally issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, which reflects the constitutional framework whereby the Governor General exercises executive authority on the advice of the Prime Minister.

It reflects the government’s intent to treat the Commission as a high-level, cross-cutting body with direct access to the highest levels of executive leadership.
