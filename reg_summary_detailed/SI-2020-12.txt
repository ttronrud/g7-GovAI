The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessments under the Species at Risk Act

**Legal Authority:**  
This order is made under **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to acknowledge the receipt of scientific assessments conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) for designated species.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   The Governor General in Council formally acknowledges receipt of scientific assessments prepared by COSEWIC for specific species listed in an annexed schedule. These assessments evaluate the conservation status of species—such as whether they are endangered, threatened, or of special concern—based on scientific data and expert review.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The assessment process under subsection 23(1) of SARA requires that the Minister of the Environment receive and consider COSEWIC’s scientific evaluations before determining whether a species should be listed or protected under SARA. This regulation confirms that the assessments have been received and are now part of the official process.

3. **Purpose and Function:**  
   - This step is a procedural requirement in the SARA listing process.  
   - It ensures transparency and accountability by formally recognizing that scientific evaluations have been completed and are available for use in decision-making.  
   - It serves as a foundation for the subsequent steps, such as the Minister’s decision to list a species as endangered, threatened, or of special concern, or to designate a species as a "species of concern" or "species at risk."

4. **Applicability:**  
   The order applies specifically to the species listed in the **annexed schedule**, which includes a list of species (e.g., plants, animals, or fungi) that have been assessed by COSEWIC and are now formally recognized as being at risk of extinction or decline.

5. **Date of Effect:**  
   The order comes into effect upon its **making** (i.e., publication in the Canada Gazette), which typically occurs shortly after the Minister receives the assessments.

6. **Administrative Significance:**  
   This regulation is not a decision itself but a procedural acknowledgment. It marks the beginning of the formal federal response to the scientific findings. It does not, by itself, result in a species being listed or protected—those decisions follow in subsequent steps involving risk assessments, public consultation, and final designation.

**Context within SARA:**

- The *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) to protect species at risk in Canada through a combination of scientific assessment, legal protection, and recovery planning.
- COSEWIC is an independent scientific body that evaluates species based on criteria such as population size, habitat loss, threats, and genetic diversity.
- The process under subsection 23(1) is a key step in the legal pathway to listing a species under SARA.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a procedural instrument that formally recognizes the completion and receipt of COSEWIC’s scientific assessments for specific species. It signifies that the federal government has taken the first formal step in the process of evaluating and potentially protecting those species under the *Species at Risk Act*. While it does not create new protections or listings, it is a critical milestone that enables the Minister of the Environment to proceed with a legally sound and science-based decision on species at risk.

**Note:**  
This regulation is typically published in the *Canada Gazette*, Part I, and is part of a broader framework of federal environmental protection. It reflects Canada’s commitment to science-based conservation and biodiversity management.
