March 25, 2019  
Issued by: The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued pursuant to **subsection 28.1(1)a of the Citizenship Act** (as amended), which grants the Minister the power to extend or modify the application of certain provisions of the Act in order to ensure the effective implementation of citizenship-related policies.

### **Core Provision of the Regulation**

The Minister extends the **application of Section 14 of the Citizenship Act** for a period of **five years**, with the extension **ending on July 31, 2024**.

#### What is Section 14 of the Citizenship Act?

Section 14 of the Citizenship Act (as of the time of this regulation) generally provides that:

> "A person who is a Canadian citizen may be required to provide information to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration regarding their citizenship status, or to confirm their citizenship in certain circumstances, including in relation to the application of certain immigration or naturalization provisions."

More specifically, Section 14 may be interpreted to relate to **citizenship verification**, **procedures for confirming citizenship status**, or **the use of citizenship certificates or documentation** in administrative or immigration contexts. It may also involve the **use of citizenship status in connection with applications for permanent residence, family reunification, or other immigration processes**.

> In practice, Section 14 often supports the ability of immigration officers or other government bodies to verify the citizenship status of individuals in administrative or adjudicative processes.

### **Purpose and Rationale of the Extension**

The extension is intended to:

1. **Ensure Continuity of Citizenship Verification Procedures**  
   Maintain consistent and reliable methods for verifying citizenship status during immigration and naturalization processes, especially in light of evolving administrative demands.

2. **Support Administrative Efficiency**  
   Allow immigration officers and service providers to continue using the provisions of Section 14 without the need for new legislative changes or amendments, thereby avoiding delays or disruptions.

3. **Provide Stability in Policy Implementation**  
   Offer a clear, predictable timeframe for the continued application of the section, which supports both government operations and public confidence in the integrity of citizenship verification processes.

4. **Address Practical Challenges**  
   Recognize that certain administrative or operational challenges (e.g., digital record-keeping, cross-border verification, or changes in immigration policy) may require the temporary or extended use of existing provisions to ensure compliance and accuracy.

### **Scope and Duration**

- **Duration:** Five years, beginning from the date of the original application of Section 14 (not explicitly stated, but implied to be from the time of the original enactment or a prior extension).
- **End Date:** **July 31, 2024**  
- **Scope:** Applies to all individuals and administrative processes involving the verification of citizenship status under Section 14 of the Citizenship Act during the period of the extension.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

   The extension does not change the rights of Canadian citizens or the obligations of individuals or government bodies. It only ensures that the procedural tools in Section 14 remain in force.

2. **Temporary Nature**  
   The extension is not a permanent change. It is designed as a **temporary measure** to provide administrative stability during a defined period.

3. **Subject to Review**  
   The Minister may review the extension and decide whether to renew, modify, or terminate it prior to July 31, 2024, based on operational needs, policy developments, or legislative changes.

4. **Compliance and Accountability**  
   The extension reinforces the importance of accurate citizenship verification and supports compliance with federal immigration and citizenship standards.
