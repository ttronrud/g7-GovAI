**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title of the Order:**  
*Canada Post Systems Management Limited Incorporation Authorization Order*

---

**1. Legal Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), specifically:

- **Paragraph 91(1)(a)** of the Financial Administration Act: This grants the Governor in Council (the federal government's executive authority) the power to make orders authorizing the procurement of corporate actions when such actions are in the public interest and are consistent with the government’s fiscal and administrative responsibilities.
- **Subsection 91(6)** of the Financial Administration Act: This provides that the Governor in Council may be satisfied that a specific transaction (in this case, the incorporation of a new corporation) is authorized under the governing legislation (here, the *Canada Post Corporation Act*).

The Governor in Council has determined, based on the recommendation of the Honourable Harvie Andre (a senior government official, likely a minister or cabinet member) and the Treasury Board, that the Canada Post Corporation is legally empowered under **Section 16 of the Canada Post Corporation Act** to undertake the transaction of incorporating a new corporation.

**2. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary objective of this Order is to **authorize the Canada Post Corporation to incorporate a new corporation** named **Canada Post Systems Management Limited (CP-SML)**.

This incorporation is intended to support the operational and strategic goals of Canada Post by establishing a separate legal entity to manage certain systems, services, or functions—likely related to information technology, operational efficiency, or system management—within the Canada Post network.

**3. Key Provisions of the Order:**

- **Authorization to Incorporate:** The Canada Post Corporation is formally authorized to proceed with the incorporation of **Canada Post Systems Management Limited** under the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA), which is the federal law governing the formation and governance of private corporations in Canada.

- **Ownership Structure:** Upon incorporation, **all shares** of Canada Post Systems Management Limited will be **held solely by the Canada Post Corporation**. This means:
  - The new corporation will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canada Post.
  - There will be no public or private shareholding.
  - The Canada Post Corporation will have full control over the entity’s governance, operations, and financial decisions.

- **Legal Citation:** The Order is formally cited as the *Canada Post Systems Management Limited Incorporation Authorization Order*, enabling it to be referenced in legal, administrative, and financial documents.

**4. Governance and Oversight:**

- The decision to proceed with the incorporation was made through a formal process involving:
  - The **Governor in Council**, representing the federal government’s executive authority.
  - The **Honourable Harvie Andre**, likely a senior minister or official with responsibility for post or public services.
  - The **Treasury Board**, which ensures fiscal responsibility and alignment with government policy and budgetary constraints.

This indicates that the move is not only operationally justified but also subject to appropriate governmental oversight and accountability.

**5. Strategic Implications:**

- The creation of a dedicated subsidiary for systems management may:
  - Improve operational efficiency by separating IT or systems functions from core postal operations.
  - Enable better governance, accountability, and performance monitoring of technical systems.
  - Facilitate future scalability, innovation, or outsourcing of specific services.
  - Support digital transformation initiatives within Canada Post.

  - Authorize any specific operational activities, contracts, or expenditures.
  - Grant financial or managerial powers beyond those defined by the CBCA and the Canada Post Corporation Act.
