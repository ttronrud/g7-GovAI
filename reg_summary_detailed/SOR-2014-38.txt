The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** under **SOR/2014-38, section 8**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from force).
- **Repeal Notice**: The repeal was enacted by **Statutory Instrument (SOR) 2014-38**, specifically under **Section 8** of that instrument.
- **Effect**: As a result of this repeal, the regulation no longer applies or has legal effect. Any previous provisions, requirements, or obligations derived from it are nullified and no longer enforceable.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Repeal typically occurs when a regulation is outdated, redundant, superseded by a new law, or no longer serves a necessary public purpose. The specific reason for repeal is not included in the provided text, but such decisions are often made during legislative review or modernization efforts.
- **Source**: The repeal is formally recorded in the *Supplemental Orders in Council* (SOR), which are official instruments used by the Government of Canada to amend or repeal regulations.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries (ten instances of the same line) are likely a formatting or technical error in the original input and do not indicate multiple distinct regulations or provisions.
- The fact that the same repeal notice is listed multiple times suggests that the regulation may have been referenced in various contexts or that the input was copied incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the input has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2014-38, section 8**. It is no longer in effect, and any legal or administrative obligations derived from it have been terminated. For accurate information on current regulations, one should consult the current version of the relevant statute or the official government database (such as CanLII or the Canada Gazette).
