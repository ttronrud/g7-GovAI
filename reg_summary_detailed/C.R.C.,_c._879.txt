### **Overview**

The *Government Annuities Regulations* (commonly cited as the "Government Annuities Regulations") are a set of administrative rules that implement and govern the operation of annuity contracts under the *Government Annuities Act* (Act). These regulations provide detailed guidance on:

- The **forms and procedures** for applying and entering into annuity contracts,
- The **mortality and interest rates** used in valuing annuities,
- The **methods of calculating annuity values** using specific tables,
- The **rights and options** available to annuitants and purchasers,
- The **conditions under which annuity terms can be varied**, and
- Special provisions for **historical contracts** and **group annuities**.

These regulations are essential for ensuring consistency, fairness, and transparency in the pricing and administration of government annuities, particularly those involving public employees or group pension plans.

## **Interest Rates for Annuity Valuation**

Interest rates are critical in determining the present value of future annuity payments. The regulations specify **different interest rates based on the type of annuity, the annuitant’s age, and the timing of commencement**.

### **1. Immediate Annuities (Paragraph 4(a) of the Act)**

- If **commencement date is before 55th birthday**: **4% annual interest**
- If **commencement date is on or after 55th birthday**: **5.25% annual interest**

> *Note: This reflects a shift in interest rate as annuitants age, recognizing increased risk and longer life expectancy.*

---

### **2. Deferred Annuities (Paragraph 4(a) of the Act)**

- If **deferral exceeds 5 years** from effective date: **4% interest**
- If **deferral is 5 years or less**, and **commencement is on or after 55th birthday**:
  - **4%** for the period from effective date to one day before commencement
  - **5.25%** thereafter

> *This structure accounts for the time value of money during deferral and adjusts for risk as the annuitant ages.*

---

### **3. Immediate Annuities for Joint Lives (Paragraph 4(b) of the Act)**

- If **either annuitant is under 55**: **4% interest**
- If **both annuitants are 55 or older**: **5.25% interest**

> *The higher rate applies only when both lives are older, reflecting reduced mortality risk.*

---

### **4. Deferred Annuities for Joint Lives (Paragraph 4(b) of the Act)**

- If **deferral exceeds 5 years**: **4% interest**
- If **deferral is 5 years or less**, and **both annuitants are 55 or older**:
  - **4%** for the period from effective date to one day before commencement
  - **5.25%** thereafter

> *Same structure as individual deferred annuities, applied to joint lives.*

---

### **5. Group Annuities (Subsection 6(3) of the Act)**

- **On or after April 1, 1964**: **5% interest** applies to all group annuities
- **Before April 1, 1953**: **4% interest** applies to employees registered under pre-1953 contracts
- **All other contracts (on or after April 1, 1964)**: **4% interest**

> *This shows a transition from lower to higher interest rates post-1964, likely reflecting inflation and investment performance.*

---

### **6. Adjustment for Changed Commencement Dates**

If the **commencement date of a deferred annuity is changed**, the interest rate is **adjusted retroactively** to reflect what would have applied had the original date been used.

> *This ensures fairness in valuation when deferral dates are modified.*

---

### **7. Compounding of Interest**

All interest calculated under the above rules is **compounded annually**.

---

## **Mortality Tables**

Mortality rates are derived from the **Annuity Table for 1949**, modified by **Projection Scale C** (published in *Transactions of the Society of Actuaries*, Vol. IV, p. 272).

### **Key Features of Mortality Table Use**

- **Basic Table**: Annuity Table for 1949 (ages 0–100) for males and females.
- **Projection Scale C**: Modifies mortality rates, with **interpolation between quinquennial ages** (every 5 years) for intermediate ages.
- **Generation Adjustment**: 
  - For annuitants born **before 1950**, use the original 1949 table rates.
  - For annuitants born **on or after 1950**, use the modified (projected) rates.
- **Generation Matching Rule** (for joint lives):
  - If **one male and one female**, treat the female as belonging to the **same generation as the male**.
  - If **both same sex**, treat both as belonging to the **generation of the older life**.

> *This ensures accurate joint-life mortality calculations by aligning lives based on age and cohort.*

---

### **Special Rule for Group Annuities**

- For **group annuities**, the **mortality rate for a male life is taken as the rate for one year older** than the actual age.

> *This is a conservative adjustment to account for higher mortality risk in male life expectancy.*

---

## **Special Provisions for Historical Contracts (Pre-1948)**

Where a person was included in a group annuity contract **before April 19, 1948**, and the contract contained specific provisions (e.g., continuation of benefits upon termination of employment or continuation of contributions), the **interest rate and mortality table** used to value a **self-purchased annuity** (on the same date and duration) shall be the **same as those in effect at the time of original inclusion**.

### **Conditions for Application**

- The **total annuities payable** under all government contracts must **not exceed $1,200 per year**.
- The provision must be explicitly stated in the original contract or agreement.

> *This protects individuals who joined early pension plans from being disadvantaged by later, more favorable interest or mortality assumptions.*

---

## **Contract Administration and Documentation**

### **Forms and Approval**

- All **applications** and **formal contracts** must be:
  - Approved by the Governor in Council
  - Signed by the **Minister or Deputy Minister** (or their facsimile/lithographed signature)
  - Countersigned by a Branch officer as directed

> *Ensures legal validity and central oversight.*

---

### **Proof of Identity and Age**

- The purchaser must provide **documentation** to verify:
  - Age
  - Identity
  - Existence
  - Death
  - Residence or domicile

> *Minister may require additional evidence as needed.*

---

### **Deferred Annuity Payments**

- Payments to deferred annuities may be made at **accounting Post Offices**.
- A **passbook** (approved by the Minister) is issued and maintained by postal staff.

> *Provides a secure, traceable record of premium payments.*

---

### **Payment Frequency**

- All annuities are **paid monthly**, unless otherwise agreed.

> *Standardized payment schedule for clarity and administrative efficiency.*

---

## **Variation of Contract Terms**

The Minister may **vary the terms of an annuity contract** under certain conditions, either by agreement or at the request of the purchaser.

### **Types of Variations (General Cases – Not under 6(3))**

1. **Single Life Annuity**:
   - Can be changed to a **term certain** (not exceeding 20 years or life of annuitant, whichever is longer)
   - Or to a **payment on a future date** (before or after original due date)

2. **Monthly Installments**:
   - For deferred annuities under paragraph 4(a): Payments may be made in monthly installments between **maturity
