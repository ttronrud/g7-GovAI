**Key Provisions:**

1. **Transfer of Function:**  
   The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, transfers to **Shared Services Canada** (SSC) the **control and supervision** of the portion of the federal public administration that falls under the **End User Devices Procurement Unit** within the **Acquisitions Branch** of the **Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS)**.

2. **Jurisdictional Background:**  
   - The End User Devices Procurement Unit was previously part of the Acquisitions Branch of DPWGS.  
   - DPWGS, established in 1966, was responsible for managing government infrastructure, public works, and procurement functions across the federal government.  
   - The Acquisitions Branch oversaw procurement activities, including the acquisition of goods and services, including end-user devices such as computers, laptops, tablets, and other technology used by federal employees.

3. **Purpose of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer was part of a broader federal government initiative to:
   - Improve efficiency and standardization in procurement processes.
   - Reduce duplication and administrative overhead by consolidating procurement functions under centralized, shared services models.
   - Enhance cost-effectiveness and transparency in the acquisition of technology assets.
   - Strengthen oversight and accountability through centralized management under Shared Services Canada.

4. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **Section 207** of **S.C. 2003, c. 22**, the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.  
   Specifically, this provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign responsibilities within the federal public service, including the transfer of control and supervision of specific units or functions, provided such transfer serves the public interest and enhances service delivery.

5. **Applicable Statute:**  
   The regulation is referenced under **R.S., c. P-34**, which is the *Public Service Act*. This statute governs the structure, functions, and responsibilities of the federal public service, including the authority to reorganize or transfer duties among departments and agencies.

6. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer takes effect on **April 1, 2013**. This date marks the formal beginning of Shared Services Canada’s responsibility for managing the End User Devices Procurement Unit.

7. **Implications:**  
   - The End User Devices Procurement Unit will no longer operate independently under DPWGS.  
   - It will now be managed by Shared Services Canada, which is a federal agency responsible for providing centralized, standardized, and cost-effective services to federal departments and agencies.  
   - The unit will be integrated into SSC’s broader procurement and technology services portfolio, aligning with federal efforts to streamline operations and promote consistency in government purchasing practices.

8. **Oversight and Accountability:**  
   While the operational control is transferred to Shared Services Canada, the unit remains accountable to the broader public service framework. Oversight will be maintained through established reporting lines, performance metrics, and compliance with federal procurement policies and standards.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative restructuring within the Canadian federal public service. By transferring the End User Devices Procurement Unit to Shared Services Canada, the government aimed to achieve greater efficiency, consistency, and cost control in the procurement of technology for federal employees. The move reflects a broader trend toward centralized, shared service delivery models in the public sector, designed to improve service quality and reduce redundancy.
