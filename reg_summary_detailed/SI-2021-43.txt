**Regulatory Summary: Transfer of the British Columbia Regional Unit to the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada**

**Effective Date:** August 6, 2021  
**Governing Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  
**Legal Basis:** Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207; R.S., c. P-34)

### **Summary of the Regulation**

On August 6, 2021, the federal government formally transferred control and supervision of the **British Columbia Regional Unit** — a component of the former **Department of Western Economic Diversification (WED)** — to the newly established **Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA)**.

This transfer is a structural reorganization within the federal public service aimed at improving regional economic development coordination, particularly in British Columbia and other Pacific provinces. The British Columbia Regional Unit had previously operated under the Department of Western Economic Diversification, which was responsible for promoting economic growth in Western Canada.

Under this regulation:
- The **control and supervision** of the British Columbia Regional Unit are now vested in the **Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada**.
- This includes all administrative, operational, financial, and policy-related responsibilities associated with the unit.
- The transfer reflects a broader effort to align economic development initiatives with regional needs and to strengthen the capacity of regional agencies to deliver targeted support.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Transfer of Authority**  
   The British Columbia Regional Unit is no longer under the jurisdiction of the Department of Western Economic Diversification. Instead, it is now governed and managed by the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada.

2. **Establishment of PEDA’s Leadership**  
   The regulation explicitly orders that the **Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages** shall preside over the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada.  
   This means that the Minister serves as the head of PEDA and is responsible for overseeing its strategic direction, budget, and operations.

3. **Legal Authority**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which permits the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign duties and control between federal departments and agencies. This provision allows for administrative restructuring without requiring new legislation, as long as it serves public service efficiency and policy coherence.

### **Purpose and Context**

The move is part of a broader federal strategy to:
- Enhance regional economic development in the Pacific provinces (including British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon).
- Improve coordination between federal economic development initiatives and regional needs.
- Create a more focused, regionally responsive agency (PEDA) to support economic diversification, innovation, and job creation in the Pacific region.

By transferring the British Columbia Regional Unit to PEDA, the government aims to:
- Strengthen regional responsiveness.
- Reduce duplication of functions.
- Improve accountability and performance through centralized regional oversight.

### **Implications**

- **For British Columbia:** The region now benefits from a more specialized agency dedicated to economic development, potentially leading to more effective programs and better alignment with local priorities.
- **For the Public Service:** The reorganization streamlines governance, reduces bureaucratic overlap, and improves interdepartmental coordination.
- **For the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages:** The role now includes leading a new regional agency, which may require additional responsibilities in policy development, program delivery, and intergovernmental coordination.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within Canada’s federal economic development framework. By transferring the British Columbia Regional Unit to the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada and designating the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages as its head, the government strengthens regional economic support and enhances the efficiency and relevance of federal development programs in the Pacific region.
