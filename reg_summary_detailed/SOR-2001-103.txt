## 📊 APR Calculation Rules (Section 600 of the Act)

### For **loans not involving credit cards or lines of credit**:
The APR must be calculated using the following formula:

> **APR = (Total Cost of Borrowing / Principal) × (100 / Term in Years)**

Where:
- **Total Cost of Borrowing** = Sum of all borrowing costs (interest, fees, etc.) over the loan term
- **Principal** = Average outstanding balance at the end of each period (before subtracting payments)
- **Term** = Duration of the loan in years (to at least two decimal places)

### Key Rules for APR Calculation:
| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Rounding** | APR may be rounded to the **nearest eighth of a percent** (e.g., 5.125%) |
| **Payment Order** | Each payment is applied **first to accumulated cost of borrowing**, then to principal |
| **Time Periods** | - 1 month = 1/12 year<br>- 1 week = 1/52 year<br>- 1 day = 1/365 year |
| **Variable Rates** | Must use the **annual rate in effect on the day of calculation** |
| **No Installments** | If no payments exist, APR is calculated assuming **lump-sum repayment at maturity** |
| **New Credit Agreements** | Even if the loan carries an outstanding balance from a prior agreement, it counts as a **new credit agreement** for APR purposes |

### For **credit cards or lines of credit**:
- **Fixed interest rate**: APR = the fixed annual interest rate
- **Variable interest rate**: APR = the annual rate **on the date of disclosure**

> If there is **no cost of borrowing beyond interest**, the APR equals the interest rate.
