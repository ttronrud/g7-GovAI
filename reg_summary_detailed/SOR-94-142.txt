### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Premium Surcharge By-law**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Citation**
The regulation is issued by the **Board of Directors of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)** under two specific provisions of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*:

- **Paragraph 11(2)(g)** – Grants the Board authority to establish by-laws regarding practices that warrant premium surcharges.
- **Subsection 25.1(1)** – Authorizes the Board to prescribe rules for assessing and applying premium surcharges on member institutions based on non-compliance with required practices.

**Statutory References:**
- *R.S., c. 18 (3rd Supp.), s. 51* – Section 51 of the CDIC Act (relating to by-law-making power).
- *R.S., c. 18 (3rd Supp.), s. 59* – Section 59 (providing for the enforcement and application of by-laws).

**Effective Date:** January 31, 1994  
**Status:** **Repealed**  
- The by-law was **repealed by SOR/2023-37, section 2**, which came into force on April 1, 2023.  
> ⚠️ **Important Note:** This by-law is **no longer in effect** as of April 1, 2023. It has been formally repealed and replaced by updated regulatory frameworks.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the By-law**
The original purpose of this by-law was to **establish clear criteria** under which member financial institutions (banks, trust companies, loan companies, etc.) could be subject to a **premium surcharge** imposed by CDIC.

A premium surcharge is an additional cost on top of the standard deposit insurance premium, charged to institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory or operational standards. The goal is to:
- Encourage compliance with deposit insurance policy requirements.
- Promote sound financial practices and governance.
- Protect depositors and maintain the stability of the financial system.

---

#### **3. What Constitutes a Practice Warranting a Premium Surcharge?**

The by-law defines a "practice that warrants a premium surcharge" as any act or omission by a member institution that results in **non-compliance with** the following categories:

---

##### **(a) Failure to Comply with Deposit Insurance Policy Requirements (Section 8(2))**
- The policy (as prescribed in the *Deposit Insurance Policy By-law*, Schedule) requires member institutions to maintain specific **practices and internal controls**.
- Non-compliance with these practices and controls (e.g., inadequate risk management, weak internal audit systems) triggers a surcharge.

##### **(b) Failure to Provide Required Information**
- Institutions must provide timely and accurate information to CDIC as mandated by the policy.
- Failure to submit required reports, disclosures, or documentation (e.g., financial statements, risk assessments) constitutes a breach.

##### **(c) Failure to Maintain Required Records**
- Under Section 24 of the Deposit Insurance Policy By-law, institutions must:
  - Prepare and maintain records related to operations, risk, and financial activities.
  - Retain those records for a specified period (e.g., at least 7 years).
- Non-compliance with record-keeping obligations is grounds for a surcharge.

##### **(d) Failure to Comply with Relevant Statutes (Corporate Governance & Operational Duties)**
The by-law identifies key areas where statutory obligations apply, including:

| Area | Relevant Statute |
|------|------------------|
| **Corporate Governance** | E.g., Board structure, oversight, accountability |
| **Financial Statements** | Preparation and filing (e.g., under the Bank Act or provincial legislation) |
| **Business and Powers** | Authority and scope of operations |
| **Investments** | Investment policies and limits |
| **Capital and Liquidity** | Minimum capital ratios, liquidity coverage |
| **Self-dealing** | Conflicts of interest and transactions involving insiders |

> **Definition of "Relevant Statute":**
> - **Federal institutions:**
>   - Bank: *Bank Act*
>   - Trust or Loan Company: *Trust and Loan Companies Act*
>   - Cooperative: *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*
> - **Provincial institutions:** The provincial statute that authorizes the institution to accept deposits (as defined in the CDIC Act).

##### **(e) Failure to Fulfill Undertakings to CDIC**
- If an institution makes a binding commitment (e.g., to improve governance, submit reports, or adopt new controls) to CDIC and fails to meet it, a surcharge may be applied.

##### **(f) Failure to Comply with Data and System Requirements By-law**
- Institutions must meet technical and data reporting standards (e.g., data accuracy, system reliability, cybersecurity).
- Breaches in data systems or reporting processes are grounds for a surcharge.

##### **(g) Failure to Comply with Eligible Financial Contracts By-law**
- Institutions must adhere to rules on eligible financial products and contracts (e.g., ensuring contracts are safe and properly documented).
- Non-compliance with these rules may lead to a surcharge.

---

#### **4. Key Amendment to Paragraph 2(1)(b)**
The by-law originally included a broader provision that was later **replaced** (by SOR/94-142 and later revised in SOR/2023-37, s.1):

> **Original (before amendment):**  
> "Failing to comply with one or more provisions of the policy of deposit insurance that require the member institution to provide the Corporation with the information and documents specified in that policy."

> **Replaced by (current version, as of 2023):**  
> "Failing to comply with one or more provisions of the policy of deposit insurance, as prescribed by section 1 of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Deposit Insurance Policy By-law and as set out in the schedule to that By-law, that require the member institution to provide the Corporation with the information and documents specified in that policy."

> 🔍 **Note:** While the wording appears similar, the replacement version emphasizes **specificity**—it ties the requirement directly to the *Schedule to the Deposit Insurance Policy By-law*, ensuring clarity and consistency in enforcement.

---

#### **5. Scope and Applicability**
- Applies to **all member institutions** of CDIC, including:
  - Federal banks
  - Federal trust and loan companies
  - Provincial credit institutions authorized to accept deposits
- Applies to **all acts or omissions** that constitute non-compliance with the listed requirements.

---

#### **6. Regulatory Context and Evolution**
- This by-law was part of CDIC’s broader framework to **enhance financial stability** and ensure that institutions maintain strong risk management and transparency.
- It reflected a shift toward **performance-based regulation**, where financial health and compliance are directly linked to insurance premiums.
- However, due to changes in the regulatory environment and the need for more modern, risk-sensitive frameworks, CDIC has **replaced this by-law** with updated regulations.

---

#### **7. Current Status: Repealed**
- **Repealed by:** *SOR/2023-37, section 2*  
- **Effective Date of Repeal:** April 1, 2023  
- **Reason for Repeal:**  
  The by-law is outdated and no longer aligned with current regulatory standards. CDIC has transitioned to a more integrated and risk-based approach using:
  - The *Deposit Insurance Policy By-law*
  - *Data and System Requirements By-law*
  - *Eligible Financial Contracts By-law*
  - Updated corporate governance and risk management standards

> 📌 **Bottom Line:** While the principles of assessing compliance and applying surcharges remain relevant, **this specific by-law is no longer in force**.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation historically established the **legal basis and criteria** under which CDIC could impose premium surcharges on member financial institutions for non-compliance with critical operational, governance, and reporting requirements. It served as a tool to promote accountability, transparency, and financial stability.

However, **as of April 1, 2023, the by-law has been formally repealed**. Its functions have been absorbed into more current, comprehensive, and flexible regulatory frameworks. Institutions are now assessed under updated by-laws that reflect modern financial risks and regulatory expectations.

### **Recommendation for Users**
