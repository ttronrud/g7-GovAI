The reference "[Repealed, SOR/2006-310, s. 6]" indicates that a specific regulation was officially repealed (cancelled or removed) by **SOR/2006-310, section 6**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable.
- **Repeal Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2006-310**, which is a formal legislative document issued under the authority of the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on context).
- **Section 6 of SOR/2006-310**: This section specifically identifies the provision that formally repeals the previously existing regulation. It serves as the legal mechanism to remove the rule from the regulatory framework.
- **Effective Date**: While the exact date of repeal is not provided in the reference, such instruments typically take effect upon publication in the *Supplementary Orders and Regulations* (SOR) or the official Gazette. In this case, the repeal would have been effective upon the publication of SOR/2006-310.

### Implications:
- Any legal obligations, administrative requirements, or procedural rules previously governed by the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Entities or individuals previously subject to the regulation must now comply with any successor rules (if applicable) or operate under general laws or new regulations that have replaced it.
- The repeal may have been enacted due to:
  - Obsolescence of the regulation (e.g., outdated procedures or standards),
  - Merger or consolidation of regulatory provisions,
  - A change in policy or legislative priorities,
  - Redundancy or overlap with other regulations.

### Important Notes:
- Since the reference does not include the **original regulation’s title or subject matter**, it is not possible to determine the specific content, purpose, or scope of the repealed rule.
- To fully understand the impact of the repeal, one would need to consult the original regulation that was repealed and the context provided in SOR/2006-310, section 6 (e.g., whether it was part of a broader regulatory reform or restructuring).

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer valid** due to being formally repealed by **Section 6 of Statutory Instrument 2006-310**. This means it has been legally removed from the current regulatory framework. For accurate historical or operational context, further research into the original regulation and the full text of SOR/2006-310 is required.
