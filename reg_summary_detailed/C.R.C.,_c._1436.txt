**Detailed Summary of the Life Saving Equipment Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Life Saving Equipment Regulations* (LSER) are a set of Canadian maritime safety regulations under the *Canada Shipping Act*, governing the mandatory carriage of life-saving equipment on vessels. These regulations ensure that ships are equipped with sufficient and properly functioning survival craft, lifejackets, distress signaling devices, and other critical safety gear to protect crew and passengers in emergencies. The regulations apply to a wide range of vessels, with specific requirements based on vessel class, voyage type, and size.

The regulations were updated in 2023 (SOR/2023-257), reflecting modern safety standards, technological advancements, and alignment with international maritime conventions. Key updates include the introduction of new definitions, clarification of exemptions, and alignment with the *International Life-Saving Appliance Code (LSA Code)* and *IMO Resolution MSC.81(70)*.

> **Note**: References to "acceptable to the Administration," "to the satisfaction of the Administration," etc., are **excluded** from interpretation — meaning equipment must meet objective, measurable standards, not subjective approval.

## **II. Exemptions**

The regulations **do not apply** to the following vessels:

- Fishing vessels  
- Pleasure craft  
- Ships of 5 gross tons or under certified to carry 12 passengers or fewer  
- Cargo ships of 15 gross tons or under  
- Ships engaged in oil/gas drilling, production, conservation, or processing  
- Ships subject to the *Vessel Construction and Equipment Regulations*

> This ensures that smaller, non-commercial, or specialized vessels are not subject to full life-saving equipment mandates.

## **III. Applicability by Vessel Class**

The regulations categorize ships into **11 classes** based on tonnage, passenger capacity, voyage type, and self-propulsion status.

| Class | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Class I** | Over 5 GT; Safety Convention ships carrying >12 passengers on unlimited voyages OR non-Safety Convention ships carrying >12 passengers on unlimited or near-coastal (Class 1) voyages |
| **Class II** | Over 5 GT; Safety Convention ships on short international voyages OR non-Safety Convention ships on near-coastal (Class 1) voyages limited to 120 nautical miles from shore |
| **Class III** | Over 5 GT; non-Safety Convention ships on near-coastal (Class 2) or inland voyages |
| **Class IV** | Over 5 GT; non-Safety Convention ships on inland voyages (≤25 nm from shore) or near-coastal (Class 2) voyages (≤5 nm from shore) |
| **Class V** | Over 5 GT; non-Safety Convention ships on sheltered waters voyages |
| **Class VI** | Under 5 GT but carrying >12 passengers |
| **Class VII** | Over 5 GT; carrying passengers; not self-propelled; towed or cable-operated |
| **Class VIII** | Reserved |
| **Class IX** | Over 15 GT; Safety Convention ships not carrying passengers OR carrying ≤12 passengers on unlimited voyages OR non-Safety Convention ships not carrying passengers or carrying ≤12 passengers on unlimited or near-coastal (Class 1) voyages |

| **Class XI** | Over 15 GT; carrying crew only; not self-propelled; towed or cable-operated |

> These classes determine the **level of life-saving equipment required** based on risk and operational environment.

---

## **IV. Additional Equipment**

Ships may carry **additional life-saving equipment** if it meets the following criteria:

1. Does not present a safety hazard  
2. Is not detrimental to the seaworthiness of the vessel  
3. Meets the requirements of the LSER  

This allows flexibility for operators to enhance safety without violating core regulations.

## **V. Substitution of Life Rafts with Marine Evacuation Systems (MES)**

Where a ship is required to carry life rafts under **Part I or II**, a **marine evacuation system (MES)** may be substituted **if**:

- The MES has **aggregate accommodation capacity equal to or greater than** the life rafts being replaced  
- The MES complies with **Chapter VI, paragraph 6.2 of the LSA Code**  
- The MES is **approved by the Board** as meeting those requirements  

This provides a modern, efficient alternative to traditional life rafts, especially for larger vessels.
