**Detailed Summary of the Sudbury Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is formally titled the **Sudbury Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. These regulations establish specific zoning and height control requirements for lands adjacent to and in the vicinity of **Sudbury Airport**, located within the **Regional Municipality of Sudbury, Province of Ontario**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Terms**

The regulations define several key terms used throughout the document:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to Sudbury Airport, situated in the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, Ontario.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed geographical point designated as the reference elevation for all height measurements. It is defined as the intersection of:
  - A line 500 feet south of the centerline of runway 11–29 (measured southerly at right angles),
  - And a line 500 feet southeast of the centerline of runway 04–22 (measured southeasterly at right angles).  
  This point is **deemed to be at an elevation of 1,126 feet above sea level** for all regulatory purposes.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (strip), at right angles to the centerline.  
  - It has a **1:50 vertical-to-horizontal slope** (1 foot rise per 50 feet run).  
  - It rises to a horizontal line **1,000 feet above the elevation at the end of the strip**, extending **50,000 feet horizontally** from the end.  
  - The outer ends of this line are **8,000 feet from the centerline** of the runway.  
  - These surfaces are illustrated on **Department of Transport Plans T2863A and T2863B (dated April 1, 1974)**.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface that defines the maximum allowable height above ground in the broader area around the airport.
  - It consists of:
    - A **common plane at 150 feet above the airport reference point (ARP)**.
    - If this plane is below 30 feet above ground level, a **minimum 30-foot surface above ground** is used instead.
  - This surface acts as a boundary for all height restrictions beyond the immediate approach and transition zones.

- **Strip**: The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, including the runway and its adjacent paved areas.
  - **Runway 04–22 Strip**:
    - Width: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side of the centerline)
    - Length: 7,000 feet
  - **Runway 11–29 Strip**:
    - Width: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side)
    - Length: 5,400 feet
  - These are clearly described and illustrated on the same Department of Transport plans (T2863A and T2863B).

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the **lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces**, rising to meet the **outer surface** or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip.
  - The slope is **1:7** (1 foot vertical rise per 7 feet horizontal run).
  - It connects the strip edges to the outer surface and ensures a smooth, continuous height gradient.
  - Also referenced in the Department of Transport plans.

### **3. Applicability of the Regulations**

- The regulations apply to **all lands** located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Sudbury Airport**, including **public road allowances**.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- The regulations **do not apply** to lands that are officially part of the airport (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or terminal facilities).

---

### **4. Height Restrictions**

#### **General Prohibition on Structures and Objects**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land covered by these regulations,
- Where the **highest point** of such object would exceed the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at the point of location**:
  1. The **approach surface**
  2. The **outer surface**
  3. The **transitional surface**

> This means that all man-made structures (buildings, towers, antennas, etc.) must remain **below or at the level** of these defined imaginary surfaces.

#### **Prohibition on Natural Growth**
No owner or occupier may allow **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, bushes) to exceed the elevation of:
- The approach surface
- The outer surface
- The transitional surface

> Even trees or vegetation must not grow above these regulated heights.

#### **Enforcement Mechanism**
If an owner or occupier **violates** this rule by allowing natural growth to exceed the permitted elevation:
- The **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** (formal order) requiring:
  - Any person to enter the land,
  - And **remove the excessive growth**.

> This provides a clear enforcement pathway for the government to ensure compliance.

### **5. Geographical Boundaries (Land Limits)**

The exact boundaries of the regulated land area are defined in **Part II of the Schedule** through a detailed **legal description** using:
- Township, range, concession, and lot designations
- Bearings and distances (e.g., "northerly along the western boundary…")
- Ontario Grid Coordinates (e.g., 16,946,093.08 N, 1,048,027.13 E)

This legal description traces a closed polygon that encircles the airport and its immediate surroundings, forming a buffer zone where height restrictions apply.

---

### **6. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.
- **Maintain clear airspace** around critical airport zones, particularly near runways and approach paths.
- **Protect flight operations** by limiting visual and physical obstructions that could compromise visibility or create hazards for pilots.

The use of **imaginary surfaces** (approach, transitional, outer) reflects engineering standards used in aviation planning to define safe zones around runways, based on **flight path geometry and aircraft performance**.

---

### **7. Reference to Planning Documents**

All defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional, strips) are **visually illustrated** in:
- **Department of Transport Plans Nos. T2863A and T2863B**, dated **April 1, 1974**.

These plans serve as the **official visual reference** for:
- Determining the exact location and shape of each surface
- Verifying compliance with height limits
- Assisting in land-use planning and development review

### **Conclusion**

The **Sudbury Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive set of aviation safety zoning rules designed to protect flight operations by strictly controlling the height of all structures and vegetation near the airport. By defining precise imaginary surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) based on established engineering standards and referencing detailed land boundaries and plans, the regulations ensure that the airport remains safe and unobstructed during all phases of flight.

These rules are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**, with clear mechanisms for addressing violations—particularly concerning natural growth. The regulations reflect a balance between land-use development and aviation safety, and are grounded in technical precision, legal clarity, and visual planning documentation.

**Note**: These regulations are not a standalone policy but are part of a broader framework of aviation safety regulations enforced by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. Any development or land use proposal in the designated area must be reviewed against these height limits.
