**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision enables the federal government to reorganize the public service by transferring control and supervision of certain public service units between departments, subject to appropriate legislative authority and administrative considerations.

**Subject of the Transfer:**  
The **Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness (OCIP-EP)**, which is a component of the public service within the **Department of National Defence (DND)**.

**Recipient Department:**  
The **Department of the Solicitor General (DSG)**.

**Nature of the Transfer:**  
The regulation transfers **control and supervision** of the OCIP-EP office — not its personnel or operational functions per se, but the administrative oversight and management responsibilities — from the Department of National Defence to the Department of the Solicitor General.

**Effective Date:**  
The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**.

**Purpose and Implications:**  
- This reorganization reflects a strategic shift in how Canada manages national security and emergency preparedness.  
- The Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness is responsible for identifying, protecting, and responding to threats to critical infrastructure (such as energy, transportation, communications, and water systems) and coordinating emergency preparedness at the national level.  
- By transferring its control to the Department of the Solicitor General, the government signals a move to place critical infrastructure protection under a broader policy and legal oversight framework, likely enhancing coordination between legal, policy, and emergency response functions.  
- The Department of the Solicitor General, as a department responsible for legal and policy matters, may now have a stronger role in shaping the legal frameworks, intergovernmental coordination, and policy development related to critical infrastructure protection and emergency preparedness.

**Key Notes:**  
- The transfer does not imply a change in the operational mandate or functions of the OCIP-EP office itself. The office continues to carry out its duties, but now under the administrative supervision of the Department of the Solicitor General.  
- The transfer is part of a broader effort to improve interdepartmental coordination in national security and emergency management.  
- This action underscores the importance placed on protecting Canada’s critical infrastructure and preparing for emergencies, aligning with national priorities in the early 2000s, particularly in the context of growing threats from terrorism and natural disasters.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. It reassigns the oversight of a key national capability — critical infrastructure protection and emergency preparedness — from the Department of National Defence to the Department of the Solicitor General, effective December 12, 2003. The move enhances policy coherence, legal oversight, and interdepartmental coordination in safeguarding Canada’s vital systems and responding to emergencies.
