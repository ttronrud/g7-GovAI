### **Scope of the Remission**

1. **Taxes under Parts III, IV, and IX of the Excise Tax Act**

   - Goods imported into Canada by, or on behalf of:
     - The **Government of the United States** or its authorized agent
     - A **department of the Government of Canada** acting on behalf of the U.S. government
     - A **Crown corporation** acting on behalf of the U.S. government

     - A U.S. government department or agency

### **Conditions for Remission (Section 3)**

Remission is **not automatic** and is granted **only if** the following conditions are met:

1. **Exclusive Use Requirement**  
   The goods, real property, or services must be used **exclusively** in connection with:
   - The **establishment of the Government of the United States** in Canada, or
   - A **joint Canada–United States government project** that has been **determined by the Minister** to be such a project.

   > This ensures that the remission is tied to legitimate, government-driven, cross-border cooperation and not for private or commercial purposes.

2. **Fate of Goods (for imported goods)**  
   For goods, one of the following must apply:
   - The goods **become the property of the Government of the United States**
   - The goods are **exported from Canada**
   - The goods are **destroyed under the supervision of an officer** as defined in section 2 of the *Customs Act*
   - The goods are **consumed during the conduct of the project**

   > This condition ensures that the goods do not remain in Canada indefinitely or are used for non-governmental or commercial purposes.

3. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   - A claim for remission of **duties** (including the tax under Division III of Part IX) on imported goods must be submitted to the Minister **within two years** of the **final accounting** of the goods under section 32 of the *Customs Act*.
   - A claim for remission of **any other tax** (not duties) must be submitted to the Minister **within two years** of:
     - The **purchase** of goods or services, or
     - The **supply** of goods or services, as applicable.

   > These deadlines ensure accountability and timely processing of claims, preventing long-term delays or loss of eligibility.

### **Key Implications and Purpose**

- **Public Interest Justification**: The revocation of the prior remission and the introduction of this new Order reflect a policy decision to ensure that tax exemptions are **targeted, transparent, and aligned with public interest goals**, particularly in fostering **bilateral cooperation** between Canada and the United States.

- **Support for Joint Projects**: The Order facilitates the development of **cooperative infrastructure**, research, defense, or administrative projects that require cross-border investment and coordination.

- **Exclusion of Private Use**: The requirement for **exclusive use** and **specific disposal conditions** prevents misuse of the remission for private or commercial gain.

- **Administrative Clarity**: The clear definition of eligible supplies, required conditions, and claim timelines provides a predictable framework for government entities involved in cross-border operations.

### **Conclusion**

This Order establishes a **structured, conditional exemption** for taxes and duties on goods, real property, and services used in **joint Canada–United States government projects**. It ensures that such projects are financially viable while maintaining fiscal discipline by:

- Limiting remission to legitimate government purposes

- Enforcing timely claims to ensure accountability

It remains a foundational policy tool for enabling **bilateral cooperation** in areas such as defense, infrastructure, environmental projects, and scientific research, while preserving Canada’s tax revenue base and regulatory integrity.

**Note**: Although the Order was issued in 1960, its principles may still be relevant today, especially in light of ongoing Canada–U.S. collaboration in areas such as climate change, border security, and shared infrastructure. However, modern tax policy and administrative practices may have led to updates or replacements in subsequent years. This summary reflects the original text and intent of the 1960 Order.
