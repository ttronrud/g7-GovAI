### **Key Definitions**
The regulation establishes clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **Association**: As defined in subsection 188(9) of the *Criminal Code*, referring to a group of individuals who form a criminal association (e.g., for illegal activities). This definition is included to ensure that only legitimate, non-criminal organizations can receive products.

- **Minister**: Refers to the current Minister of Agriculture, responsible for overseeing the policy and implementation of these regulations.

- **Officer**: A person appointed by the Minister under subsection 188(3) of the *Criminal Code*. Officers have the authority to enforce compliance with the regulations and may require the return of products.

- **Product**: Any photographic material, video material, or video signal produced by a contractor during a horse race using a photo-finish or video camera for the Minister. This includes raw or processed footage related to the race.

- **Product User**: A contractor or an association that receives a product under an agreement. These are the intended recipients of the materials.

- The Director may enter into a written agreement with any product user to transfer or loan products.
- The agreement may allow for **repeated transfers or loans** over time, depending on the terms agreed upon.

### **Conditions for Termination and Return of Products**

1. **Right to Terminate**:  
   The Director may **terminate the agreement at any time** if a product is used in violation of the conditions specified in **section 4** of the regulations.

2. **Obligation to Return Products**:  
   If a product user uses a product in breach of section 4, they must **immediately deliver the product to an officer** upon request from the Director. This ensures swift enforcement and prevents misuse.

### **Conditions Governing the Use of Products**
The Director is **prohibited from transferring or loaning a product** unless it is used **only for viewing or reproduction** (or both), and only for **one or more of the following approved purposes**:

1. **Promoting the horse racing industry**  
   – To enhance public awareness and support for horse racing as a sport or economic activity.

2. **Compiling personal records for participants in horse racing**

### **Revocation Note**
The regulation was **revoked by SOR/86-388, section 3**.

However, due to their **revocation in 1986 (SOR/86-388, section 3)**, the regulations are **no longer valid or enforceable**. As such, any current handling of racing photographic or video products would be governed by **other laws**, such as the *Criminal Code*, *Copyright Act*, or more recent policies related to sports media and data rights.

> 📌 **Note for Practitioners**: This regulation should not be interpreted as current policy. Legal compliance today requires reference to **current federal statutes and ministerial directives** on copyright, data use, and sports media management.
