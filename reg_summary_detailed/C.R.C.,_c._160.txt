**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Turkey Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled the **Manitoba Turkey Order** and may be cited as such.  
- It serves as a legal instrument under the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* (Loi) to regulate the marketing of turkeys in Manitoba.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order defines several key terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the regulation of agricultural commodities, including turkeys, in Manitoba.

- **Board** (Revoked):  
  - Originally referred to the "Manitoba Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board" or "Board."  
  - **Status**: This provision has been **revoked** by *SOR/82-669, section 1*, meaning the Board no longer holds any legal authority under this Order.  
  - *Implication*: The regulatory body previously responsible for oversight has been formally removed from the current framework.

- **Commodity Board**:  
  - Refers to the **Manitoba Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board**, established under the *Natural Products Marketing Act*.  
  - Though the Board is now technically revoked, the Order continues to refer to it as having authority, indicating a potential transitional or historical reference. However, the current regulatory power is exercised by the **Commodity Board** as a functional entity, despite the revocation of the original Board.

- **Plan**:  
  - Denotes any marketing plan for turkeys developed and amended over time under the authority of the Act.  
  - The Plan governs how turkeys are marketed locally and may influence interprovincial and export marketing decisions.

- **Turkey**:  
  - Defined broadly as *any variety, grade, or class of turkey raised or kept for slaughter within the Province of Manitoba*.  
  - This includes all types of turkeys (e.g., male or female, different breeds, weight classes) as long as they are raised within Manitoba for slaughter.

### **3. Regulatory Authority of the Commodity Board**

Despite the revocation of the original "Board," the **Commodity Board** is granted specific authority to regulate the **marketing of turkeys** in two key areas:

#### **A. Interprovincial and Export Trade**
- The Commodity Board is authorized to regulate the **interprovincial** (sales between provinces) and **export** (sales outside Canada) trade in turkeys.
- This includes the power to:
  - Issue **orders** (regulatory directives) concerning persons and property located within Manitoba.
  - Exercise **all powers** that it would normally have in relation to **local marketing** of turkeys under the Act and the Plan — **except** those powers exercised by the **Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency (CTMA)** under the *Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act*.

> **Important Note**: The exclusion of powers exercised by the CTMA indicates that the Commodity Board does not have jurisdiction over national-level marketing functions governed by federal legislation. This ensures provincial autonomy in local and regional markets while respecting federal oversight in broader national marketing.

---

### **4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**

The Commodity Board is empowered to:

- **Make orders** that:
  - Fix, impose, and collect **levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of turkeys** within Manitoba.

- **Classify producers into groups**:
  - The Board may categorize producers (e.g., small farms, large producers, cooperatives) into distinct groups based on size, volume, or other relevant factors.
  - Different **levies or charges** can be set for members of different groups.

- **Set variable rates**:
  - The amount of levy or charge payable by producers depends on their group classification — allowing for equitable or incentive-based structures.

- **Use collected levies and charges for specific purposes**, including:
  - Establishing **reserves** (funds set aside for future use, e.g., price stabilization).
  - Covering **operating expenses** and **losses** incurred due to:
    - The sale or disposal of turkeys.
    - Market fluctuations or adverse conditions (e.g., poor market prices).
  - **Equalizing or adjusting** payments among producers:
    - To ensure fairness in distribution of revenues from turkey sales.
    - To compensate producers who may have suffered financial losses during certain periods.

> This mechanism supports **economic stability** among producers by smoothing out market volatility and ensuring that producers benefit from market gains or are protected during downturns.

---

### **5. Key Exclusions and Limitations**

- The Commodity Board **does not have authority** over powers exercised by the **Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency (CTMA)** under the *Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act*.  
  - This means that national-level marketing policies, pricing, or distribution mechanisms governed by federal law are outside the scope of this Order.

- The **revocation of the original Board** (SOR/82-669, s. 1) indicates that the structure of the original marketing board is no longer active — suggesting that the Commodity Board may now operate under a restructured or reformed mandate.

---

### **6. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of the Manitoba Turkey Order are:

1. **To ensure fair and stable marketing conditions** for turkey producers in Manitoba.
2. **To protect producers** from market volatility through financial safeguards (e.g., reserves, loss compensation).
3. **To promote equitable distribution of profits** from turkey sales across different producer groups.
4. **To provide a mechanism for revenue collection** to fund marketing activities and support the industry.

---

### **7. Legal and Practical Implications**

- The Order operates as a **provincial regulatory tool** under the *Natural Products Marketing Act*, allowing Manitoba to manage its own turkey marketing system independently of federal controls.
- It enables the Commodity Board to act as a **market stabilizer**, especially during periods of low demand or price drops.
- The classification system allows for **tailored financial responsibilities** based on producer size or capacity, promoting inclusivity and fairness.

### **Conclusion**

The **Manitoba Turkey Order** is a foundational regulatory instrument that empowers the Commodity Board (despite the revocation of the original Board) to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of turkeys in Manitoba. It enables the Board to impose tiered levies or charges on producers, classify them into groups, and use collected funds for reserve creation, loss compensation, and equitable profit sharing. While it does not extend to federal powers exercised by the Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency, it plays a vital role in supporting the economic sustainability and stability of the Manitoba turkey industry.

> **Note on Revocation**: Although the original Board is revoked, the Order continues to assign regulatory authority to the Commodity Board, suggesting that the current structure may operate under a reconstituted or renamed entity with similar functions. This reflects a potential evolution in the governance of agricultural marketing in Manitoba.
