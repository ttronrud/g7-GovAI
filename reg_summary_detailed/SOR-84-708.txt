### What Does "Repealed" Mean?

When a regulation is "repealed," it means that the specific provision or rule was officially removed from legal effect. This typically occurs when:

- A new regulation replaces it (either by amendment or full replacement),  
- The regulation is deemed outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current laws, or  
- A legislative or administrative decision determines that it is no longer necessary or appropriate.

In this case, **Section 1 of SOR/2017-84** was the provision that formally repealed a prior regulation. However, the original regulation that was repealed is **not explicitly named** in your input.

Therefore, while we know that **SOR/2017-84, s. 1** repealed a previous regulation, the **specific content of the repealed regulation** is not provided in your query.
