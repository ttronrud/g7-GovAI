**Detailed Summary of the Exemption for Public Notices or Documents Regulations (Insurance Companies and Insurance Holding Companies)**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This means that the government, through its financial policy arm, has formally authorized the creation of these rules.

The legal foundation for these regulations is found in two provisions of the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act):

- **Subsection 1021(1)a** – This provision grants the authority to make regulations that exempt certain public notices or documents from specific requirements, typically to facilitate operational efficiency or compliance with broader regulatory objectives.
- **Section 1047b** – This section provides the mechanism for establishing exemptions in relation to public notices or documents, with specific conditions to ensure that such exemptions do not undermine the rights of shareholders, policyholders, or the public interest.

Thus, the regulation is a formal legislative instrument designed to provide a legal exemption under the Insurance Companies Act for certain public notices or documents issued by insurance companies and insurance holding companies.

**2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **exempt certain public notices or documents** from the requirement to be published in a prescribed manner (such as in a designated public register or media outlet) under the Insurance Companies Act.

This exemption allows insurance companies and insurance holding companies to streamline internal communications, reduce administrative burdens, or improve operational efficiency—without compromising transparency or regulatory oversight—provided that the exemption is justified and safeguards are maintained.

**3. Key Provisions and Conditions**

- **Definition of "Act"**: In these regulations, the term *Act* refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*, which provides the overarching legal framework governing the operations of insurance companies and their holding companies.

- **Prescribed Circumstances for Exemption**:  
  Under **section 1047 of the Act**, the exemption is only valid if it **does not prejudice**:
  - The rights of any **shareholders** who are entitled to vote;
  - The rights of any **policyholders** who are entitled to vote;
  - The **public interest** in general.

  This condition ensures that while operational flexibility is granted, the fundamental rights of stakeholders and the broader public are protected. The exemption cannot be used in a way that undermines accountability, transparency, or access to information.

- **Scope of Application**:  
  The regulations apply to:
  - **Insurance companies**
  - **Insurance holding companies**

  These entities may use the exemption when issuing certain public notices or documents (e.g., notices of changes in management, financial updates, or corporate actions), provided the exemption is properly justified and meets the above conditions.

**5. Legislative References**

The regulation is referenced in the following statutory sources:

- **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 364** – This section likely provides the enabling authority or amendment that allows the creation of these specific regulations.
- **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 367** – This may refer to a related provision that supports the structure or scope of the exemption.
- **S.C. 1991, c. 47** – This is a foundational statute or prior regulation that may establish general principles for public notices or corporate disclosures in the insurance sector.

These references confirm the historical and legislative continuity of the regulatory framework governing insurance disclosures.

**6. Key Implications and Outcomes**

- **Operational Flexibility**: Insurance companies and holding companies can issue certain notices or documents without being required to publish them in formal, publicly accessible channels (e.g., the official registry or a public media outlet), reducing compliance costs and administrative complexity.

- **Transparency Safeguards**: Despite the exemption, the requirement that it not prejudice shareholders, policyholders, or the public interest ensures that transparency is not compromised. The regulator maintains oversight to prevent misuse.

- **Stakeholder Protection**: The exemption is not a blanket waiver. It is subject to strict conditions that protect the voting rights of shareholders and policyholders and ensure the public remains informed about material corporate actions.

**Conclusion**

The *Exemption for Public Notices or Documents Regulations (Insurance Companies and Insurance Holding Companies)* is a targeted regulatory tool designed to balance **operational efficiency** with **regulatory accountability**. By allowing certain disclosures to be exempt from mandatory public publication, it supports the day-to-day functioning of insurance entities. However, it does so under strict conditions that preserve the rights of stakeholders and the public interest—ensuring that transparency and fairness remain central to the regulatory framework.

This regulation reflects a pragmatic approach to regulation, recognizing the need for flexibility in corporate governance while maintaining the integrity of investor and policyholder protections under the *Insurance Companies Act*.
