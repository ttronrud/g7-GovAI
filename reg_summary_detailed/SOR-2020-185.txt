**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Northern Wolffish (Anarhichas denticulatus) Order**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Framework**

This regulatory instrument is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, enacted in Canada as **S.C. 2002, c. 29**, and further amended by **S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60**. SARA is a federal law designed to protect wildlife species at risk by identifying, designating, and managing critical habitat, and by ensuring that actions that affect such habitat are reviewed and mitigated.

The specific provision invoked in this Order is **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of SARA, which allows the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate critical habitat for a listed species when certain conditions are met.

---

### **2. Species at Risk**

The **Northern Wolffish (Anarhichas denticulatus)** is a marine fish species native to the North Atlantic and is recognized as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA**. This classification means the species is at risk of becoming extinct due to natural or human-caused factors.

---

### **3. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**

A formal **recovery strategy** for the Northern Wolffish was developed and includes a detailed description of its **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species. This recovery strategy has been officially **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to track species at risk and their conservation status.

The critical habitat identified in the recovery strategy is now formally designated through this Order.

---

### **4. Jurisdictional and Legal Compliance Check**

The Order explicitly confirms that **no portion of the designated critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b of SARA**. This subsection prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas where a **wildlife management board (WMB)** has exclusive jurisdiction under a **land claims agreement**. Since no such overlap exists, the Order does not interfere with Indigenous rights or land claims governance in this regard.

This is a key legal safeguard to ensure that the designation of critical habitat does not override or conflict with Indigenous self-governance in wildlife management.

---

### **5. Consultation with Wildlife Management Boards**

The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has determined that the proposed designation of critical habitat **affects an area** where a **wildlife management board** is authorized under a land claims agreement to perform wildlife-related functions. In response, the Minister **consulted** with that specific wildlife management board **pursuant to subsection 58(8) of SARA**, which requires consultation with Indigenous entities when critical habitat designation may impact their jurisdiction.

This consultation process ensures that Indigenous communities have a voice in decisions affecting species at risk on their traditional territories, reflecting the principles of **Indigenous rights and co-management** under SARA.

---

### **6. Legal Authority and Purpose of the Order**

The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, based on the above conditions and in accordance with **subsection 58(1)** of SARA, **designates the specific areas** identified in the recovery strategy as the **critical habitat** of the Northern Wolffish.

- **Section 58(1)** applies to the critical habitat of the species, meaning that once designated, the habitat is legally protected under federal law.
- The designation is intended to ensure that **protection, management, and development activities** in these areas are subject to review and mitigation to prevent harm to the species’ recovery.

---

### **7. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., upon official publication in the Canada Gazette).
- Once in force, the designated critical habitat is legally enforceable under SARA, and any federal or provincial activity that may impact this area must comply with the requirements of the Act, including environmental assessments and mitigation measures.

---

### **8. Significance of the Order**

This Order represents a key step in the **conservation and recovery** of the Northern Wolffish by:

- Legally recognizing and protecting the specific marine environments essential for the species' survival.
- Ensuring compliance with both environmental protection standards and Indigenous rights and governance.
- Supporting the implementation of the species’ recovery strategy through clear, enforceable spatial boundaries.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Northern Wolffish (Anarhichas denticulatus) Order*, issued on **August 25, 2020**, formally designates the critical habitat of this threatened species in accordance with the Species at Risk Act. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, complies with legal requirements (including land claims and Indigenous consultation), and reflects a balanced approach to species conservation and Indigenous rights. The Order ensures that the marine areas essential for the Northern Wolffish’s survival are protected from harmful development and activities, thereby contributing to the long-term recovery of the species.
