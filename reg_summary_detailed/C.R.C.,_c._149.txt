**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Turkey Marketing Levies Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled:  
**British Columbia Turkey Marketing Levies Order**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a legally binding instrument under the framework of the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act*.

---

### **2. Key Definitions (Key Terms in the Order)**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the establishment and operation of the turkey marketing scheme in British Columbia.

- **Commodity Board**: The *British Columbia Turkey Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation), established under the Act. This body is responsible for administering the marketing scheme, setting quotas, and collecting levies on turkey production and trade.

- **Market Allotment**:  
  The total quantity of turkey meat (in pounds) that a producer is allowed to market—whether within the province (intraprovincial), between provinces (interprovincial), or internationally (export)—based on the Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations and decisions made by the Commodity Board under the *Plan*.  
  This allotment acts as a cap on how much turkey a producer can sell without incurring additional levies.

- **Plan**: The *British Columbia Turkey Marketing Scheme*, which is established and amended over time under the Act and any associated regulations. The Plan sets out the rules, quotas, and procedures governing turkey production, marketing, and financial obligations.

- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the actual production of turkeys (i.e., raising or keeping turkeys for slaughter) within the Province of British Columbia.

- **Turkey**: Any turkey—regardless of breed, grade, or class—that is raised or kept for slaughter within BC and sold for slaughter. This definition ensures that only turkeys produced and intended for slaughter within the province are subject to the levy.

---

### **3. Core Levy Requirement**

- **Levy Rate**:  
  Every producer who sells turkeys **in excess of their market allotment** must pay a levy of **$0.05 per pound of live weight** on each such turkey sold.

  - This levy applies only to turkeys sold beyond the producer’s allocated market allotment.
  - It is in addition to any licence fees required under the *Plan*.

- **Purpose of the Levy**:  
  The levy is designed to ensure fair market participation, manage supply, and generate revenue to support the sustainability and regulation of the turkey marketing system. It helps prevent overproduction and ensures that surplus turkey is managed through a structured, regulated framework.

### **4. Obligations of Buyers (Purchasers of Turkeys)**

- When a buyer purchases turkeys from a producer, they are **required to deduct the applicable levy** (at $0.05 per pound live weight) from the total payment due to the producer.

- The buyer must **forward the full amount of the levies** to the Commodity Board **not later than the 15th day of the month next following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.

  - For example, if turkeys are sold in March, the buyer must pay the levies to the Commodity Board by April 15.

- This ensures that the levy is collected efficiently and that the Commodity Board receives timely revenue from transactions involving surplus turkey.

---

### **5. Obligations of Producers (When Levies Are Not Deducted by Buyers)**

- If a producer sells turkeys **and the buyer fails to deduct or pay the levy**, the producer is personally responsible for paying the levy.

- The producer must pay the levies **to the Commodity Board at its office in Surrey, British Columbia**, **not later than the 15th day of the month next following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.

- This provision ensures that the levy is not avoided through non-compliant buyers and that all producers ultimately fulfill their financial obligations.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The Commodity Board has the authority to enforce compliance with this Order.
- Failure to pay levies on time may result in penalties or administrative actions, although specific penalties are not detailed in this excerpt.
- The levy system is integrated into the broader *Plan*, which governs the allocation of market shares and the overall management of turkey supply in BC.

---

### **7. Key Objectives of the Regulation**

1. **Market Stabilization**: By limiting the amount of turkey a producer can sell, the system prevents market oversupply and price crashes.
2. **Revenue Generation**: The levy provides a source of income for the Commodity Board to fund administrative costs, monitoring, and potential support programs.
3. **Fairness and Accountability**: Ensures that producers who exceed their market allotment contribute financially to the system, preventing free-riding.
4. **Transparency and Traceability**: The levy system supports tracking of turkey production and trade, which is essential for regulatory oversight.

### **8. Practical Implications for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Producers** | Must monitor their market allotment; pay $0.05 per pound live weight on any turkey sold beyond the allotment; ensure levies are paid by the 15th of the following month if not deducted by buyers. |
| **Buyers** | Must deduct levies from payments to producers and remit them to the Commodity Board by the 15th day of the next month. |
| **Commodity Board** | Collects levies; administers the Plan; ensures compliance with the levy system. |

### **Conclusion**

The *British Columbia Turkey Marketing Levies Order* establishes a clear, enforceable financial mechanism to manage turkey production and trade in the province. By imposing a levy of $0.05 per pound live weight on turkeys sold beyond a producer’s market allotment, the regulation promotes market stability, ensures equitable cost distribution, and supports the long-term sustainability of the turkey industry in BC. The system is designed to be both practical and accountable, with defined roles for producers and buyers and a central administrative body (the Commodity Board) to oversee compliance and collection.

This regulation operates as a key component of the broader *British Columbia Turkey Marketing Scheme*, which aims to balance supply, demand, and producer interests within a regulated market framework.
