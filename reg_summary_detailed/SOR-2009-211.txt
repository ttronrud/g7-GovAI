The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2013-244, s. 15]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 15 of the Statutory Rules Order 2013 (SOR/2013-244)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2013-244**, which is a Statutory Rules Order issued in 2013.
- **Section Repealed**: Specifically, **Section 15** of that Order repealed the referenced regulation.
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or provisions previously established by the regulation are **no longer applicable** under current law. Legal authorities, courts, or regulatory bodies must now refer to the current version of the statute or regulation that replaced it (if applicable), or to other provisions that remain in effect.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the specific reason for repeal is not detailed in the provided text, such repeals typically occur when:
  - The regulation is outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It conflicts with newer legislation.
  - It overlaps or duplicates existing rules.
  - It is replaced by a more comprehensive or updated provision.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest a possible formatting or data input error, as the same repeal notice is listed multiple times. In official legal databases, each regulation is typically referenced once.
- The absence of the original regulation’s content (e.g., title, scope, provisions) means a detailed summary of what the regulation *used to cover* cannot be provided from this text alone.
- To fully understand the scope of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the original text of the regulation prior to repeal or the explanatory notes in SOR/2013-244.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **fully repealed** and **no longer valid** under Canadian law. It was removed by **Section 15 of SOR/2013-244**, and its provisions are no longer enforceable or applicable. For current legal compliance, practitioners or officials should refer to the current legislation that may have replaced it or to the official registry of active regulations.
