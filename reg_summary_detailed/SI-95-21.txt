Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the regulation you provided:

---

### **Regulation Summary: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)**  
**Title:** Remittance of Income Tax for Certain Taxation Years (1987–1995) – Adjusted for CPP Section 63.1 Timing  

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Context**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**.
- It is based on **subsection 23(2)** of the **Financial Administration Act**, which allows the government to remit certain taxes when deemed unjust or inappropriate.
- This specific regulation addresses a **tax relief provision** related to the **timing of Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits** under **section 63.1** of the CPP Act.

---

#### **2. Scope of the Remittance**
The regulation directs the **remittance (refund or cancellation)** of the **net total of income tax** payable under:
- **Part I** of the *Income Tax Act*
- **Part I.1** of the *Income Tax Act*

For the **taxation years 1987 through 1995 inclusive**.

> This means that the tax liability for these years is being reduced or eliminated for certain taxpayers under specific conditions.

---

#### **3. Key Condition for Tax Exemption**
The remittance applies **only if** the following condition is met:

> *The part of any amount received by a taxpayer after 1987 and before 1996*  
> *(by reason of section 63.1 of the Canada Pension Plan)*  
> *that was payable for a month in a year preceding the year in which it was received*  
> *had been received in that preceding year.*

In simpler terms:
- Section 63.1 of the CPP Act allows for **the deferral of CPP benefits** — meaning, a pension payment due in a later year may be **paid in the year it was originally due**, rather than when the actual benefit is received.
- The regulation assumes that **if the CPP benefit had been paid in the year it was due (i.e., the preceding year)**, then **no income tax would have been owed** on that amount under the Income Tax Act.
- Therefore, the tax liability is being **reduced or removed** because the taxpayer would not have had to report the income in a later year, thus avoiding tax consequences.

---

#### **4. Exclusions from the Remittance**
The remittance **does not apply** to:
- **Sections 122.2 and 122.4 to 122.64** of the *Income Tax Act*, as they read at any time during the relevant period.

> These sections likely relate to **taxable income, deductions, or specific rules** regarding CPP or pension income.  
> The regulation explicitly **excludes** the impact of these provisions — meaning, even if they would have increased tax liability, they are not considered in the calculation of the remitted tax.

> This is significant because it ensures that the tax relief is **not reduced** by these specific tax rules, which may have otherwise increased the tax burden.

---

#### **5. What Is Being Remitted?**
The remittance includes:
- The **net total** of income tax that would have been payable (i.e., after deductions and credits).
- **All relevant penalties and interest** associated with the tax liability.

> This means that not only is the tax being refunded, but any **penalties or interest** that would have been imposed due to late payment, underpayment, or non-compliance are also being waived or remitted.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Rationale**
The regulation aims to:
- **Correct an injustice** in the tax treatment of CPP benefits that were deferred under section 63.1.
- Prevent taxpayers from being taxed on income that was **already received in a prior year**, even if the payment was delayed.
- Ensure that the **timing of CPP benefit receipt** does not lead to unintended tax consequences.

This reflects a policy of **tax fairness and consistency**, particularly in cases where benefit timing affects the tax year in which income is reported.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaway**
This regulation provides a **one-time tax remittance** to taxpayers who:
- Received CPP benefits under section 63.1 of the CPP Act
- And those benefits were **delayed** until after the year in which they were originally due
- And the benefit would have been **taxable in the earlier year** if it had been received earlier

As a result, the tax due for the 1987–1995 years is **reduced or eliminated**, and any associated penalties or interest are also waived.

---

#### **8. Limitations and Conditions**
- Applies **only to the years 1987 to 1995**
- Applies only to **taxpayers who would not have owed tax** if the CPP benefit had been received in the preceding year
- Does **not apply** to sections 122.2 and 122.4 to 122.64 of the Income Tax Act
- Is a **one-time correction**, not a general rule for future years

---

### ✅ Summary in One Sentence:
> The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, remits the full net income tax (including penalties and interest) for the 1987–1995 taxation years to taxpayers who would not have owed tax on CPP benefits under section 63.1 of the Canada Pension Plan if those benefits had been received in the year they were originally due — excluding specific provisions of the Income Tax Act that would otherwise affect the tax calculation.

---

This regulation is a **corrective measure** designed to ensure fairness in the taxation of CPP benefits due to timing issues, and it reflects a recognition that tax liability should not be imposed on income that was already earned and received in a prior year.
