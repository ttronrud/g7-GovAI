**Detailed Summary of the Transfer of Military Films to NATO Order**

**Title and Citation:**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Transfer of Military Films to NATO Order* and may be cited accordingly.

**Purpose and Scope:**  
This order establishes a legal framework under which the Canadian Minister of National Defence may transfer certain military-related film materials to NATO and to NATO and Commonwealth military forces. The primary objective is to serve the public interest by facilitating the sharing of military knowledge, training resources, and technical information among allied forces.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Authorization to Transfer Films:**  
   The Minister of National Defence is explicitly authorized to transfer military films and film materials—specifically those related to technical operations, training methodologies, and informational content—gratuitously (i.e., without monetary compensation) to:
   - NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization), and
   - NATO and Commonwealth military forces (i.e., allied forces from member nations of the Commonwealth, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and others).

2. **Nature of Transferable Materials:**  
   The films and materials that may be transferred include:
   - Military technical films (e.g., equipment operation, engineering procedures, maintenance protocols)
   - Training films (e.g., drills, operational procedures, safety practices)
   - Informational films (e.g., mission planning, field operations, communication strategies)

3. **Value Limitation:**  
   A critical restriction is placed on the value of the films or materials being transferred. The total estimated value of any single item or batch of materials must not exceed **$1,000 CAD**. This cap ensures that the transfer remains within a defined financial boundary and prevents the movement of high-value or sensitive materials that could pose security risks.

4. **Decision-Making Authority:**  
   The Minister of National Defence holds the sole discretion to determine whether a transfer is appropriate. This decision must be based on a clear assessment that the **public interest** would be best served. The public interest may include:
   - Enhancing interoperability among allied forces
   - Improving training effectiveness and operational readiness
   - Strengthening international military cooperation
   - Promoting transparency and shared knowledge in defense matters

5. **Gratuitous Nature of Transfer:**  
   The transfer is strictly non-commercial and free of charge. No financial compensation or reimbursement is required from NATO or Commonwealth forces in return for the materials.

6. **Implications and Context:**  
   This regulation reflects Canada’s commitment to multilateral defense cooperation through NATO and the broader Commonwealth. By allowing controlled sharing of non-sensitive, low-value film content, Canada supports joint training and operational preparedness while maintaining appropriate safeguards to protect national security interests.

**Limitations and Safeguards:**  
- The restriction on value ($1,000) acts as a safeguard to prevent the transfer of potentially sensitive or high-risk materials.
- The requirement to assess public interest ensures that transfers are not made arbitrarily or for strategic advantage without justification.
- The scope excludes high-security or classified content, which would remain under domestic control.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Transfer of Military Films to NATO Order* is a targeted, limited, and publicly accountable mechanism enabling Canada to contribute to allied military cooperation through the sharing of non-sensitive, low-cost training and technical film materials. It balances the benefits of international collaboration with the need to protect national security and fiscal responsibility. The transfer remains within a clearly defined framework governed by the Minister’s judgment and the public interest standard.
