---

### **1. Legal Context and Purpose of the Proclamation**

This document is an **official Canadian government proclamation** issued under the authority of the **Governor in Council**, acting on the advice of the Privy Council for Canada. It serves as a formal legal declaration under **section 2(3) of the Carriage by Air Act (Chapter C-14 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970)**.

The primary purpose of the proclamation is to **certify the status of Canada and other states** in relation to key international agreements governing international air carriage. Specifically, it confirms:

- Which countries are **High Contracting Parties** to the **Warsaw Convention (1929)**;
- Which countries are parties to the **Hague Protocol (1955)** amending the Warsaw Convention;
- Which countries have availed themselves of the **Additional Protocol** to the Warsaw Convention, which modifies certain rules regarding international air transport.

This proclamation is published in the *Canada Gazette*, making it a legally binding and publicly accessible instrument of Canadian law.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

#### **A. Certification of High Contracting Parties to the Warsaw Convention (1929)**

- The Governor in Council certifies that **each state listed in Part I of Schedules I and II** is a **High Contracting Party** to the **Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air**, signed in Warsaw on **October 12, 1929**.
- The certification specifies **the territories** under each state’s jurisdiction to which the Convention applies.
- The **date when the Convention came into force** for each party is indicated in the schedules.

> *This establishes the legal framework for international air transport obligations under the original 1929 Convention, which governs matters such as liability for damage to passengers, baggage, and cargo during international air travel.*

---

#### **B. Certification of Parties to the Hague Protocol (1955)**

- The proclamation confirms that **each state listed in Part II of Schedules I and II** is a **High Contracting Party** to the **Protocol signed at The Hague on September 28, 1955**, which amends the Warsaw Convention.
- This Protocol modernizes and clarifies the rules of the original Convention, particularly regarding:
  - The **liability of carriers**;
  - **Limitation of liability**;
  - **Jurisdiction and enforcement**;
  - **Interpretation of terms**.
- The **date of entry into force** of the Protocol for each party is specified in the schedule.

> *This amendment is crucial because it brings the Convention up to date with evolving international standards and legal practices in aviation.*

#### **C. Certification of States That Have Availed Themselves of the Additional Protocol (1929)**

- The proclamation identifies **states listed in Part III of Schedule I** that have **opted into the Additional Protocol** to the Warsaw Convention.
- This Additional Protocol allows a state to **exclude the first paragraph of Article 2** of the Warsaw Convention from applying to **international carriage by air performed directly** by that state or by any territory or possession under its jurisdiction.
- In other words, these countries may **choose not to be bound by the general rule** that international carriage by air is governed by the Convention — if the carriage is conducted **directly** by the state (e.g., domestic or state-operated flights with no third-party involvement).

> *This provision provides flexibility for certain states to manage their own regulatory frameworks for domestic or state-run air services, avoiding the automatic application of international liability rules.*

### **3. Important Legal and Procedural Notes**

- **Article XXI and XXIII of the Hague Protocol**:  
  The proclamation notes that **ratification or adherence** by any state that is **not originally a party to the Warsaw Convention** will result in **automatic adherence to the Convention as amended by the 1955 Protocol**.  
  → This means that even if a country didn’t previously sign the Warsaw Convention, joining the 1955 Protocol automatically makes it a party to both the Convention and its amended version.

- **Ambiguity in Dates**:  
  - For some entries, the **date when the Convention or Protocol came into force** is **not ascertained** (i.e., not known or specified).  
  - This reflects either incomplete data or historical uncertainty in the entry into force of certain treaties for specific states.

---

### **4. Legal Effect and Enforcement**

- This proclamation is **not merely informational**; it has **binding legal effect** under Canadian law.
- It serves as **official recognition** of international treaty obligations by Canada, which is required for domestic courts, regulatory bodies (such as Transport Canada), and private parties involved in international air transport.
- It enables Canadian authorities to:
  - Enforce international air carriage rules;
  - Interpret liability in cross-border air accidents;
  - Coordinate with foreign governments on aviation standards and regulations.

### **5. Signatory and Authority**

### **6. Significance and Historical Context**

- The **Warsaw Convention (1929)** is one of the foundational treaties in international aviation law. It established uniform rules for liability in international air transport and remains a cornerstone of global air law.
- The **Hague Protocol (1955)** updated and clarified these rules, especially in light of new technologies and expanded air travel.
- The **Additional Protocol** (1929) allows flexibility for states to tailor their domestic air services to national interests, which is particularly relevant for countries with extensive domestic air networks or state-owned carriers.

> This 1985 proclamation ensures that Canada's legal framework remains aligned with international standards and provides clarity for legal, commercial, and regulatory actors in the aviation sector.

### **7. Conclusion**

This proclamation is a **critical legal instrument** that:

- Confirms Canada’s and other nations’ adherence to international air transport law;
- Establishes the territorial scope and effective dates of key treaties;
- Grants flexibility to certain states in managing domestic air carriage;
