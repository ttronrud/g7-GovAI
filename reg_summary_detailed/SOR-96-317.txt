## 💰 Fee Structure by Export Volume and Conditions

### 1. **Base Permit Fee (Administrative Charge)**

- **$9** – if the permit is delivered by a **non-public servant** under contract with the Minister.
- **$14** – if delivered by an **official of the Export and Import Controls Bureau**.

> This fee is **separate** from volume-based fees and applies to all permits.

---

### 2. **Volume-Based Fees (Per Thousand Board Feet)**

| Scenario | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| **Exports within the Established Base** (≤14.7B bf) | - $50 per 1,000 bf (lower fee base)<br> - $100 per 1,000 bf (upper fee base) |
| **Exceeds Established Base but ≤15.35B bf** (lower fee base) | $50 per 1,000 bf |
| **Exceeds 15.35B bf** (upper fee base) | $100 per 1,000 bf |

> These fees apply **only when the total export volume by an exporter and a resident of Canada exceeds 28.75% of the exporter’s export level** in a quarter, or when total exports exceed the established base in a year.

> ✅ **Note:** The fee applies to **all exporters and residents** who jointly exceed thresholds.

  - If exports ≥ **90 million board feet**, fee = **upper fee base rate** ($100 per 1,000 bf).
- For **upper fee base**:

#### B. **Products First Manufactured in BC and Exported During the Year Starting April 1, 2000**

  - Fee applies at **upper fee base rate** for the **greater of**:

## 🚫 Exemptions from Fees

An exporter is **exempt from the volume-based fee** if:
1. **Production in the prior calendar year** was **less than 10 million board feet**.
2. **Production dropped by at least 25%** in the prior calendar quarter due to:
   - Worker strike
   - Mill fire
   - Forest fire
   - Any other **force majeure event**
   - The exporter must **notify the Government of Canada** within 60 days of the event.
   - Canada must provide documentation to the U.S. government within 60 days.

> Exemptions are intended to protect producers facing unforeseen disruptions.

## 📉 Fee Reductions Based on Market Prices

**Fees are waived for an "additional quantity" (92 million bf)** if, during any calendar quarter, the **average price** in *Random Lengths* meets or exceeds:
- **$405 per 1,000 bf** (April 1, 1996 – March 31, 1998)
- **$410 per 1,000 bf** (after March 31, 1998)

> This incentivizes exporters to export when prices are high (i.e., during strong market conditions), reducing the burden during price downturns.

> ❌ **Second Additional Quantity (72.5 million bf)**: **No fee waiver** applies — fees are always charged.

---

## 💵 Fee for Exporters Without Export Level

An exporter **without an export level** (i.e., not participating in the quota system) pays:
- **$100 per 1,000 board feet**.

> This is a higher rate and reflects the lack of quota protection.

---

## 📈 Annual Inflation Adjustment

All fees (including base, volume, and special rates) are **adjusted annually on April 1** based on:
- **Annual percentage change** in the simple average of:
  1. **U.S. CPI (All Urban Consumers, excluding food and fuels)** – from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
  2. **Canadian CPI (Consumer Prices and Price Indexes)** – from Statistics Canada (catalogue no. 62-010-XPB)
