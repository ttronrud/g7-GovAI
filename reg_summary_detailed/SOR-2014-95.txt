### **Detailed Summary of the Experimental Lakes Area Research Activities Regulations (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 143(2))**

---

#### **1. Background and Purpose**

These regulations were issued by the **Minister of the Environment** of Canada on **April 16, 2014**, pursuant to **subsection 36(5.2)a of the Fisheries Act**. This power allows the Minister to make regulations governing specific activities in designated areas when certain conditions are met.

The background includes:
- The **Governor in Council** previously established conditions under which the Minister may exercise regulation-making authority under subsection 36(5.2)a of the Fisheries Act.
- Those conditions have now been satisfied, enabling the Minister to issue these specific regulations.

The primary purpose of the **Experimental Lakes Area Research Activities Regulations** is to **permit and regulate scientific research activities** involving the deposition of substances into water bodies within the **Experimental Lakes Area (ELA)** in Ontario — a unique and protected site used for studying freshwater ecosystems, particularly fish populations and water quality.

These regulations balance **scientific inquiry** with **environmental protection**, ensuring that research activities do not harm fish or their habitats.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined in the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Fisheries Act*, which provides the legal framework for protecting fish and aquatic ecosystems. |
| **Aquatic research project** | A project involving the **deposit of a deleterious substance** into water frequented by fish, along with any monitoring related to that deposit. |
| **Deleterious substance** | Defined as per subsection 34(1) of the Fisheries Act — any substance that is harmful or potentially harmful to fish, fish habitat, or water quality. |
| **Director** | The Director of the Forest Products and Fisheries Act Division, Industrial Sectors Directorate, Environmental Stewardship Branch, Department of the Environment. This individual is responsible for oversight and enforcement. |
| **Experimental Lakes Area (ELA)** | A protected scientific area in Ontario consisting of specific lakes (listed in Schedule 1) and streams (listed in Schedule 2). It is used for long-term environmental research. |
| **Operator** | The entity or individual responsible for managing and operating the Experimental Lakes Area. |

> These definitions establish a clear scope and accountability framework for all activities conducted in the ELA.

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply **specifically to the Experimental Lakes Area** in Ontario. They govern all **aquatic research projects** conducted within this area, particularly those involving the intentional or accidental release of substances into water bodies.

---

#### **4. Permissibility of Depositing Deleterious Substances**

A deleterious substance **may be deposited** in the ELA **only if**:
- The **sole purpose** of the deposit is **scientific research**.
- All conditions outlined in **Sections 4 to 7** are met.

This ensures that any release of potentially harmful substances is strictly justified and monitored, minimizing environmental risk.

---

#### **5. Annual Reporting Requirements (Section 4)**

The **operator** must submit an annual report to the **Director** by **March 31** of each year, detailing information about all aquatic research projects conducted during the prior calendar year.

The report must include the following elements:

1. **Operator Information**  
   - Name and contact details (address, phone number, email)

2. **Project Supervision Details**  
   - Name and resume (including list of publications) of each person responsible for supervising each research project

3. **Contact Information for Key Personnel**  
   - For each supervisor, full contact details (address, phone, email)

4. **Reporting Period**  
   - Start and end dates of the reporting period

5. **Report Date**  
   - Date on which the report is submitted

6. **Project Count**  
   - Total number of aquatic research projects conducted during the reporting period

7. **Project-Specific Information (for each project)**  
   - Title of the project  
   - Start date and actual or projected end date  
   - Name and affiliation of the lead researcher  
   - Summary of the project, explaining how it contributes to knowledge about:  
     - Managing, conserving, protecting, or restoring fish populations  
     - Water quality and fish habitat  
   - For each deposit made:  
     - Date and duration  
     - Location (lake/stream name, latitude, longitude)  
     - Substance deposited and amount or concentration  
     - Flow rate of the deposit  
   - Summary of findings up to the end of the reporting period  
   - List of publications resulting from the project  
   - Summary of measures taken to limit potential harm to fish and water

> This comprehensive reporting ensures transparency, accountability, and scientific traceability of all research activities.

---

#### **6. Emergency Response Plan (Section 5)**

The operator must:
- Prepare a detailed **emergency response plan**.
- **Update it annually**.
- Make it **readily available on-site** to all personnel involved in implementing the plan.

The plan must include the following components:

1. **Risk Identification**  
   - Identification of risks associated with **unanticipated deposits** that could harm:
     - Fish populations  
     - Fish habitat  
     - Human use of fish (e.g., fishing)

2. **Prevention, Preparedness, and Response Processes**  
   - Clear procedures to prevent, prepare for, and respond to identified risks.

3. **Roles and Responsibilities**  
   - List of individuals responsible for implementing the plan, with clear descriptions of their duties.

4. **Training Requirements**  
   - Specific training required for personnel to carry out the plan effectively.

5. **Alerting and Notification Procedures**  
   - Procedures to notify:
     - Affected individuals or communities  
     - The public, if necessary  
     - In cases of unanticipated deposits that pose a risk to fish or human use

> This ensures rapid and coordinated action in the event of environmental harm, minimizing ecological and public health impacts.

---

#### **7. Notification Requirements (Section 6)**

The operator must:
- **Notify a fishery officer or inspector in writing** as soon as feasible if there is:
  - **Unanticipated morbidity or mortality** in fish (i.e., illness or death) that results from an aquatic research project.

This requirement ensures prompt regulatory response and helps assess whether the research activity may have unintended consequences.

---

#### **8. Notification of Regulatory Changes (Section 7)**

If the operator makes a change to the **processes** governing the research (e.g., modifications to protocols, safety procedures, or management systems) that could lead to a failure to meet the conditions set out in the **Regulations Establishing Conditions for Making Regulations under Subsection 36(5.2)** of the Fisheries Act, the operator must:
- Notify the **Director in writing**.
- Do so **not later than 10 business days** after the change occurs.

This ensures ongoing compliance with the legal and environmental safeguards established in the enabling regulations.
