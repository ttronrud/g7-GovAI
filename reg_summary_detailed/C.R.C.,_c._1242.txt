Certainly. Below is a **detailed and accurate summary** of the provided regulation, interpreted and structured for clarity, legal precision, and contextual understanding:

---

### **Detailed Summary of the Oaths of Office Regulations**

#### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled the **Oaths of Office Regulations**.
- It may be cited as such in legal and administrative contexts.

---

#### **2. Scope of Applicability**
- **Applicable Offices**: Every individual who is:
  - Appointed to, or
  - Holding an office
  that falls **under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada** (i.e., federal offices established by or under the authority of the Canadian Parliament).

> This includes positions such as judges, members of Parliament, ministers, federal department heads, and other officials whose duties are governed by federal law.

---

#### **3. Oath of Office – Default Form**
- In **any case where no existing law prescribes a specific form** of oath for a particular office:
  - The person must take the **oath of office** in the form **set out in the Schedule** to these Regulations.
- The Schedule provides the **standard wording** of the oath, which is intended to be used as a uniform and binding requirement for all such offices unless otherwise mandated by specific legislation.

> This ensures consistency and legal clarity in the swearing-in process for federal office holders when no statutory form exists.

---

#### **4. Right to Affirm Instead of Oath**
- In **civil cases** (e.g., in courts or legal proceedings), individuals in **any part of Canada** are permitted by law to **affirm instead of take an oath**.
- This right extends to **office-taking**:
  - A person who is legally allowed to affirm in civil matters may **affirm their office** in lieu of taking an oath.
  - The affirmation must be in **substantially the same terms** as the oath of office, with **necessary adjustments** ("mutatis mutandis") to reflect the context of office-taking.

> For example, the affirmation would retain the core commitment to perform duties faithfully and include confidentiality obligations, but would be phrased using the word "affirm" instead of "swear."

---

#### **5. Legal Effect of an Affirmation**
- An **affirmation of office**, taken before the **proper officer** (e.g., a notary public, justice of the peace, or designated official), is **legally valid and equivalent** to an oath of office.
- This applies **only to individuals described in subsection (1)** — i.e., those appointed to or holding a federal office under the legislative authority of Parliament.
- The affirmation has **the same legal effect** as the oath:
  - It binds the individual to perform duties faithfully.
  - It includes the obligation to **not disclose or make known any confidential information** acquired in the course of office without due authority.

---

#### **6. Content of the Oath/Affirmation (as provided in the text)**
The core wording of the oath or affirmation is:

> *"I, [Name], do solemnly and sincerely swear that I will truly and faithfully and to the best of my skill and knowledge execute and perform the duties that devolve upon me as a [Office], including the duty not to disclose or make known, without due authority in that behalf, any matter that comes to my knowledge by reason of my holding that office. So help me God."*

**Key Elements of the Oath/Affirmation:**
- **Solemn and sincere commitment**: The individual pledges to act with integrity and seriousness.
- **Faithful performance of duties**: A binding obligation to carry out the responsibilities of the office diligently and honestly.
- **Confidentiality clause**: A critical component requiring the individual to:
  - Not disclose or make known any information learned in office.
  - Only disclose such information with **due authority** (e.g., legal or official permission).
- **Religious reference**: The phrase *"So help me God"* is included, which is common in traditional oaths. However, this is **not mandatory** — it is replaced in affirmations with a neutral statement (e.g., "I affirm") and the religious reference is omitted in the affirmation version.

> Note: The inclusion of "So help me God" reflects a traditional form of oath-taking, but the regulation explicitly allows for affirmation, which removes the religious component and makes the process more inclusive.

---

#### **7. Legal and Practical Implications**
- **Uniformity**: The regulation ensures that all federal office holders take a standardized oath or affirmation, promoting consistency across offices and jurisdictions.
- **Inclusivity**: By allowing affirmations, the regulation respects religious or personal beliefs, enabling individuals who object to swearing on God to still enter office legally and with full legal standing.
- **Confidentiality**: The requirement to protect sensitive information is central to public trust and institutional integrity, especially in roles involving access to personal, financial, or national security data.
- **Enforcement**: The oath or affirmation is not merely symbolic; it is a **legal commitment** that can be invoked in cases of misconduct, breach of duty, or misuse of confidential information.

---

#### **8. Limitations and Exclusions**
- The regulation **does not apply** to:
  - Provincial or municipal offices (which fall under provincial legislative authority).
  - Offices created under laws that prescribe a different form of oath or affirmation.
- It only applies where **no existing law specifies** the form of the oath — in which case the Schedule form is used.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Oaths of Office Regulations** establish a clear, inclusive, and legally binding framework for officeholders in federal positions to enter office. They:
- Provide a **standardized form of oath** for federal offices when no specific law exists.
- Allow **affirmations** in place of oaths for those who are legally permitted to affirm in civil matters.
- Ensure that all officeholders, regardless of religious belief, take a solemn commitment to perform their duties faithfully and protect confidential information.
- Reinforce **public accountability**, **integrity**, and **institutional trust** in the Canadian federal government.

This regulation is a foundational element of Canadian public service ethics and governance, balancing legal formality with inclusivity and respect for individual conscience.
