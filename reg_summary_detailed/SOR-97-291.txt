### **Detailed Summary of the Tailored Collar Shirts Remission Order, 1997**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The **Tailored Collar Shirts Remission Order, 1997** was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff Act (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.))**.  
This provision allows the government to grant remissions (i.e., reductions or waivers) of customs duties under specific conditions for certain goods, particularly in response to economic or industrial policy objectives.

---

#### **2. Definition of "Tailored Collar Shirt"**
A **tailored collar shirt** is defined as:
- A **man’s or boy’s fabric shirt** classified under **heading No. 62.05** of the Customs Tariff.
- It must have a **collar** composed of one or more pieces of material that are:
  - **Cut and sewn**, or
  - **Fused together**,
- Designed with **two pointed or round ends** (i.e., a traditional or styled collar, not a flat or turned-down collar).

> This definition ensures that only specific types of shirts—those with a distinct, structured collar—are eligible for remission.

---

#### **3. Scope and Duration of Remission**

The remission applies to **tailored collar shirts imported into Canada** by **specific manufacturers listed in the Schedule** during defined periods. The remission is granted **only to manufacturers listed in the Schedule** and is subject to several conditions.

##### **Period 1: July 1, 1997 – December 31, 2004**
- **Full remission** of customs duties is granted.
- Applies to all tailored collar shirts imported during this period.

##### **Period 2: January 1, 2005 – December 31, 2006**
- **Full remission** of customs duties is granted.

##### **Period 3: January 1, 2007 – December 31, 2007**
- **75% remission** of customs duties.

##### **Period 4: January 1, 2008 – December 31, 2008**
- **Two separate remissions** are granted:
  - 50% remission
  - An **additional 25% remission**
  - **Total effective remission = 75%** of customs duties

##### **Period 5: January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2009**
- **75% remission**

##### **Period 6: January 1, 2010 – December 31, 2010**
- **50% remission**

##### **Period 7: January 1, 2011 – December 31, 2011**
- **50% remission**

##### **Period 8: January 1, 2012 – December 31, 2012**
- **50% remission**

> The remission **gradually decreases** over time, reflecting a phased reduction in support, likely to encourage industry competitiveness or transition to more efficient production methods.

---

#### **4. Limitations and Caps on Remission**

To prevent excessive or unsustainable financial burdens on the government, the remission is **capped** based on prior remissions under the **Tailored Collar Shirts Remission Order, 1988**.

##### **Cap on Remission Amounts:**
- **For imports during July 1, 1997 – December 31, 1997**:
  - Remission cannot exceed **half** of the total customs duties remitted to the manufacturer under the **1988 Order** for shirts imported in **1995**.

- **For any calendar year from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2012**:
  - Remission cannot exceed the **total amount** of customs duties remitted to the manufacturer under the **1988 Order** for shirts imported in **1995**.

> This cap ensures that the total remission over time does not exceed a predetermined historical benchmark, preserving fiscal responsibility.

##### **Prohibition on Exceeding 1988 Remission Total**
- **No remission** will be granted for the period **July 1, 1997 – December 31, 1997** if the combined remission under this Order and the 1988 Order would **exceed** the total remitted under the 1988 Order for 1995 shirts.

> This prevents double-dipping or over-compensation, ensuring consistency and fairness in the fiscal treatment of manufacturers.

---

#### **5. Claim Deadline**
- A manufacturer must **submit a claim for remission to the Minister of Finance within five years** of the date the tailored collar shirt is imported into Canada.

> This five-year window ensures timely claims and administrative feasibility, while also encouraging prompt action by manufacturers.

---

#### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on July 1, 1997**.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Support for Domestic Manufacturing** | The remission aims to support Canadian manufacturers of tailored collar shirts by reducing their import costs, especially during early stages of industry development or transition. |
| **Phased Reduction of Subsidy** | The gradual reduction in remission (from 100% to 50%) reflects a policy of **phasing out support** as the industry matures and becomes more competitive. |
| **Fiscal Responsibility** | The cap on remission ensures that the government does not overcommit financially, especially in light of prior support under the 1988 Order. |
| **Promotion of Industry Sustainability** | By limiting claims and setting time-bound deadlines, the Order encourages efficient and responsible use of remission benefits. |
| **Targeted Policy** | The Order is **not general**—it applies only to specific goods (tailored collar shirts), specific manufacturers, and specific timeframes. This ensures targeted intervention rather than broad, uncontrolled subsidies. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Tailored Collar Shirts Remission Order, 1997** is a **targeted, time-limited, and phased fiscal incentive** designed to support Canadian manufacturers of tailored collar shirts from 1997 to 2012. It provides **full or partial remission of customs duties**, with **gradually decreasing levels of support** over time, and includes **strict caps and claim deadlines** to ensure fiscal accountability and prevent abuse.

It reflects a strategic approach to industrial policy—offering initial strong support to build capacity, then gradually reducing support to promote self-sufficiency and market competitiveness, all within a well-defined legal and financial framework.
