These privileges and immunities are granted **only to the extent required** for the representatives to perform their official duties related to the Meeting.

**3. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes the following definitions to ensure clarity and consistency:

- **Convention**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in **Schedule III** of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act. This means the Order draws upon the legal framework and principles established in the UN Convention, which governs the rights and immunities of international organizations and their representatives.

**4. Scope of Privileges and Immunities**

Under this Order:

- During the period from **September 22, 2003, to October 10, 2003** (a window that includes the Meeting and a few days before and after),  
- **Representatives of member states** of the Conference of American Armies  
- Shall have in Canada, **to the extent necessary** for the performance of their official functions related to the Meeting,  
- The **privileges and immunities** specified in **paragraph 11(d) of Article IV of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations**.

**5. Nature of the Privileges and Immunities (Based on Article IV, para. 11(d))**

Although the full text of Article IV, paragraph 11(d) is not included in the Order, it is known from the UN Convention that such privileges typically include:

- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., protection from being sued or prosecuted in Canadian courts for acts performed in the course of official duties);
- **Exemption from certain taxes and duties**;
- **Freedom from search or seizure** of personal effects or property;
- **Immunity from arrest** for acts performed in the course of official duties;
- **Freedom to travel and communicate** without undue interference.

These immunities are **limited in scope** and are **only applicable to the extent required** for the representatives to carry out their functions during the Meeting. This ensures that the privileges are not granted broadly or without restriction, and are tailored to the specific needs of the organization’s operations in Canada.

---

**6. Temporal and Geographical Scope**

- **Time Period**: The privileges and immunities apply from **September 22, 2003**, to **October 10, 2003** — a 19-day window that begins before the Meeting and extends slightly beyond it. This allows for preparation, travel, and post-meeting activities.
- **Location**: The privileges apply **within Canada**, specifically in relation to the Meeting in Ottawa.

---

**7. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Statutes of Canada. This is standard practice in Canadian legislation, ensuring that the Order becomes legally effective upon formal publication and registration in the Canada Gazette.

---

**8. Key Legal and Diplomatic Implications**

- This Order is an example of **dual use of international law**: it applies the framework of the UN Convention (a global standard) to a specific, non-UN international organization (the Conference of American Armies).
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to **international cooperation** and **diplomatic neutrality**, allowing member states to conduct official military-related discussions without fear of domestic legal interference.
- The **limited scope** and **purpose-based** nature of the immunities ensure that the rights granted are proportional and justified, aligning with principles of accountability and legal oversight.

---

**Conclusion**

This Order is a **temporary, targeted, and legally grounded** measure that enables the representatives of the Conference of American Armies to conduct their official business in Canada without undue legal or administrative barriers. By invoking the UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities, Canada ensures that the Meeting can proceed in a manner consistent with international norms and diplomatic practice, while maintaining strict limits on the scope and duration of the privileges granted.

It is a practical application of Canada’s foreign affairs powers under the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act, demonstrating how national law can support international cooperation in a structured and legally defensible way.
