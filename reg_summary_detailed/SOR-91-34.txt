The regulation you provided is a **provincial tax prescription regulation** under the **Excise Tax Act** of Ontario, issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. It was enacted in **1990** (S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12) and originally aimed to **prescribe certain taxes, duties, and fees** that are imposed by provincial legislatures or under specific provincial statutes, particularly those related to **real property transfers and certain percentage-based taxes on goods and services**.

However, it is **important to note** that this regulation has been **partially repealed** over time. Specifically:

> **[Repealed, SOR/2006-280, s. 2]**  
> and  
> **[Repealed, SOR/2013-44, s. 2]**  
> and  
> **[Repealed, SOR/2002-273, s. 3]**  
> and  
> **[Repealed, SOR/2010-152, s. 2]**  
> and  
> **[Repealed, SOR/2006-280, s. 4]**  
> and  
> **[Repealed, SOR/2014-248, s. 8]**

This means that **many of the provisions in the regulation have been formally removed or superseded** by later amendments or new legislation. Therefore, while the regulation is historically significant, **it is no longer fully in force** as of today.

## 🔍 Detailed Summary of the Remaining (Historically Active) Provisions

### 1. **Definitions in the Regulation**

#### a) *General Sales Tax Rate of a Province*
This defines the baseline provincial sales tax rate applicable in each province, with specific references to provincial legislation:

| Province | Relevant Law |
|--------|-------------|
| **Quebec** | Section 16 of *An Act respecting the Québec sales tax*, R.S.Q., c. T-0.1 |
| **Manitoba** | Subsection 2(1) of *The Retail Sales Tax Act*, C.C.S.M., c. R130 |
| **British Columbia** | Subsection 34(1) of *Provincial Sales Tax Act*, S.B.C. 2012, c. 35 |
| **Saskatchewan** | Subsection 5(1) of *Provincial Sales Tax Act*, R.S.S. 1978, c. P-34.1 |

> Note: The BC reference is from a later law (2012), suggesting the regulation was updated to reflect changes in provincial tax structures.

#### b) *Specified Tax Rate of a Province*
This is the **maximum tax rate** that may be imposed on certain goods or services, calculated as:

> **Specified Tax Rate = Max(12%, General Sales Tax Rate + 4%)**

This ensures that **no single provincial tax (on goods/services) exceeds 12% above the base rate**, and that **the total of all such percentage-based taxes does not exceed this cap**.

> Example:  
> If Manitoba’s general sales tax is 8%, then the specified tax rate is 12% (since 8% + 4% = 12%).  
> If the general rate is 10%, the specified rate is still 14% → capped at 12% → so the specified tax rate is **12%**.

Thus, **the specified tax rate acts as a ceiling** to prevent excessive taxation on goods and services.

### 2. **Types of Taxes, Duties, and Fees Prescribed**

The regulation prescribes three categories of taxes, duties, or fees under section 154 of the Excise Tax Act:

---

#### ✅ Category 1: Taxes on Transfers of Real Property

These are taxes imposed by provincial legislation on the transfer of real property (land, buildings, etc.). The list includes:

- *Land Transfer Tax Act*, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.6  
- *Chapter 760 of the City of Toronto Municipal Code* (as it existed on **February 1, 2008**)  
- *Land Transfer Duties Act*, R.S.Q., c. D-17  
- *Part III.7 of the Taxation Act*, R.S.Q., c. I-3  
- *An Act respecting duties on transfers of immovables*, R.S.Q., c. D-15.1 *(repealed in 2002)*  
- *Part V of the Municipal Government Act*, S.N.S. 1998, c. 18 *(repealed in 2002)*  
- *Real Property Transfer Tax Act*, S.N.B. 1983, c. R-2.1  
- *Part III of The Tax Administration and Miscellaneous Taxes Act*, C.C.S.M., c. T2  
- *Property Transfer Tax Act*, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 378  
- *Land Titles Act, 2000*, S.S. 2000, c. L-5.1  
- *Land Titles Act*, R.S.A. 2000, c. L-4  
- *Real Property Transfer Tax Act*, S.P.E.I. 2005, c. 49  
- *Registration of Deeds Act*, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. R-10  
- *City of St. John’s Municipal Taxation Act*, S.N.L. 2006, c. C-17.1  

> 🔍 **Purpose**: To ensure that all provincial real property transfer taxes are recognized and accounted for under a unified framework under the Excise Tax Act.

> ⚠️ Note: Several of these (e.g., D-15.1, Part V of Municipal Government Act) were **repealed in 2002**, indicating that the regulation was updated to reflect modern provincial tax laws.

#### ✅ Category 2: Percentage-Based Taxes on Goods or Services (imposed by provincial Acts)

A tax is included if it meets **all of the following conditions**:

1. The tax is calculated as a **percentage of the value or price** of the property or service.  
2. The tax is **payable by the recipient** of the supply (not the seller).  
3. The tax is **not included** in the value or price used to calculate any other tax.  
4. The **sum of all such percentage-based taxes** under the provincial Act **does not exceed the specified tax rate of the province**.

> 🔍 This provision ensures **tax compatibility** — no province can impose multiple percentage-based taxes that collectively exceed the specified tax rate (e.g., 12% or general rate + 4%).

> Example:  
> If a province has a general sales tax of 8%, the specified tax rate is 12%.  
> If a service is taxed at 5% under one law and 6% under another, total = 11% → allowed.  
> If total = 13% → **not allowed**.

> This prevents **tax cascading** and ensures **provincial tax systems remain within a defined limit**.

---

#### ✅ Category 3: Specific Taxes on Services or Property (imposed under certain Acts)

These are taxes imposed under specific provincial laws, with the same conditions as above (percentage-based, paid by recipient, not included in value, total ≤ specified tax rate):

- *Section 330 of The Municipal Act*, C.C.S.M., c. M225 *(repealed in 2010)*  
- *Subsection 442(1) of The City of Winnipeg Charter*, S.M. 2002, c. 39 *(repealed in 2010)*  
- *Section 316 of The Municipalities Act*, S.S. 2005, c. M.36.1 *(repealed)*  
- *Subsection 2(1) of the Tourism Levy Act*, R.S.A. 2000, c. T-5.5 *(repealed)*  
- *Section 2 of the Liquor Tax Act*, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 141 *(repealed in 2014)*  

> 🔍 These were **specific municipal or service-based levies** (e.g., tourism, liquor, local services) that were previously subject to the cap under the specified tax rate.

> ⚠️ All of these have been **repealed**, meaning they are **no longer in force**.
