### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (the exact name or content of which is not provided in the text) was **repealed** (officially cancelled or abolished) by **Statutory Instrument 2009-103**, under **section 5** of that instrument.

#### Key Points:
1. **Repeal Status**: The regulation in question is no longer in force. It has been formally removed from the legal framework.
2. **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted through **SI 2009-103**, a statutory instrument issued in the United Kingdom (or a relevant jurisdiction, such as Canada or Australia depending on context—though typically UK-based given the SI numbering).
3. **Section 5 of SI 2009-103**: This section specifically identifies the provisions that are being repealed. While the full text of SI 2009-103 is required to determine the exact regulation repealed, the repetition of the same reference suggests that multiple provisions or a specific rule was targeted for removal.
4. **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed to:
   - Remove outdated or obsolete provisions.
   - Simplify the legislative framework.
   - Align with new laws or policy objectives.
   - Avoid legal confusion or overlap.
5. **Lack of Specific Content**: The provided text does not include the original regulation's name, subject matter, or scope. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation itself (e.g., its purpose, application, or key requirements) cannot be provided.

#### Conclusion:
The information provided only confirms that a regulation was **repealed by SI 2009-103, section 5**. Without access to the full text of SI 2009-103 or the original regulation, it is not possible to summarize the content, intent, or operational details of the repealed rule. To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the Statutory Instrument or related legislative records.

> ✅ Recommendation: To proceed with a detailed summary, access the full text of **Statutory Instrument 2009-103** (e.g., via legislation.gov.uk or the relevant national legislative database) and locate the section that specifies the repealed regulation. Then, review the original regulation’s content prior to repeal.
