**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* (S.C. 2002, c. 29), outlines decisions by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, regarding the listing status of several wildlife species and populations under Schedule 1 of the Act—the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk*. The regulation contains three key components:

### **1. Decision Not to Add Five Beluga Whale Populations to the List**

**Species Involved:**  
Five distinct populations of the beluga whale (*Delphinapterus leucas*):  
- Cumberland Sound  
- Eastern High Arctic/Baffin Bay  
- Eastern Hudson Bay  
- Ungava Bay  
- Western Hudson Bay  

**Scientific Background:**  
- Belugas are medium-sized toothed whales known for their white coloration in adulthood, stout bodies, and lack of a dorsal fin.  
- They inhabit cold Arctic waters and move seasonally between ice-free areas in winter and shallow bays/estuaries in summer.  
- COSEWIC has identified seven distinct populations based on genetic differences and disjunct summer distributions.  

**Threats to Beluga Populations:**  
- Historical commercial hunting (especially in the past) has caused significant declines.  
- Ongoing threats include:  
  - Ice entrapments  
  - Predation by polar bears and killer whales  
  - Vessel noise and disturbance  
  - Climate change  
  - Contaminants  
  - Hydroelectric dams  

**Reason for Not Listing:**  
- The decision not to list these five populations is **not based on a lack of concern for their survival**, but rather on the **need for further consultation with Indigenous communities**, specifically the **Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB)**.  
- Inuit peoples have played a central role in the management and conservation of beluga whales through subsistence and cultural practices, and their traditional knowledge is critical to effective conservation.  
- The federal government recognizes that any future listing decision must be made with full consideration of Inuit perspectives and traditional knowledge.  
- Continued engagement with the NWMB ensures that any future listing decisions are **culturally sensitive, scientifically sound, and aligned with community values** and long-term recovery goals.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- The Minister of the Environment will continue to manage these populations under the *Marine Mammal Regulations* under the *Fisheries Act*.  
- The decision is **temporary and conditional**—future assessments may revisit listing status if new data or community input emerges.

### **2. Decision Not to List the Porbeagle Shark (*Lamna nasus*)**

**Species Involved:**  
Porbeagle shark — a blue-gray, stout shark reaching up to 3.2 meters in length with a lifespan of 30–40 years.

**Scientific Background:**  
- Porbeagle sharks are found across the Atlantic and parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  
- In Canada, they are currently harvested in two ways:  
  - As part of a **directed fishery** (managed under the *Canadian Atlantic Pelagic Shark Integrated Fisheries Management Plan*)  
  - As **bycatch** in large pelagic and groundfish fisheries  

**Key Concerns with Listing:**  
- **Economic Impact:**  
  - Listing would eliminate the directed fishery and prohibit the sale or trade of porbeagle sharks caught as bycatch.  
  - Estimated **economic losses** to the fishing industry:  
    - $0.8 million to $1.8 million in direct losses over 20 years  
    - Additional **$0.7 million** in regional "spin-off" effects (e.g., jobs, supply chains)  
- **Scientific and Monitoring Impact:**  
  - The existing fishery provides **valuable data** on population trends and health.  
  - Without fishing, **discard mortality** (unreported deaths of bycaught sharks) would increase, undermining scientific monitoring efforts.  
  - Annual monitoring costs could rise to **up to $50,000 per year** due to the lack of data from fisheries.  

**Management Approach:**  
- The federal government will continue managing porbeagle sharks under the *Fisheries Act*.  
- A **Conservation Strategy** is being developed (to be finalized in 2006) to:  
  - Rebuild populations  
  - Improve reporting of catches  
  - Reduce bycatch  
  - Limit the directed fishery  
- Current catch limits are already set at levels that do not threaten long-term recovery.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Listing is not justified at this time due to **significant economic, social, and scientific consequences**.  
- The current management framework is deemed sufficient to protect the species while supporting sustainable fisheries.

### **3. Decision Not to List Two White Sturgeon Populations**

**Species Involved:**  
Two populations of white sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*):  
- Lower Fraser River  
- Middle Fraser River  

**Scientific Background:**  
- White sturgeon is Canada’s largest freshwater fish, capable of exceeding 6 meters in length.  
- Spawning occurs only in the Fraser, Columbia, and Sacramento River systems.  
- COSEWIC identifies **six genetically distinct populations** in Canada, including four in the Fraser River system and two in the Columbia River system.  
- These populations are **genetically isolated**, and each has unique ecological and reproductive characteristics.  

**Threats to White Sturgeon:**  
- Habitat degradation and loss due to:  
  - Dams and impoundments  
  - Channelization and diking  
  - Pollution  
  - Illegal fishing and bycatch  
- Emerging threat: **Commercial aquaculture**, which could introduce genetic contamination and disease risks.  

**Reasons for Not Listing:**  
1. **Socioeconomic Impacts:**  
   - Listing would lead to **significant economic losses** to:  
     - The **recreational fishing industry** (estimated annual losses: **$2.1 million to $9.3 million**)  
     - **First Nations communities** who harvest white sturgeon as bycatch during their salmon fisheries (for food, social, and ceremonial purposes).  
   - Listing could **restrict traditional fishing activities**, undermining cultural practices and food security.  

2. **Loss of Stewardship and Monitoring Tools:**  
   - The **catch-and-release recreational fishery** on the Lower and Middle Fraser Rivers is a **critical source of data** on population trends, health, and behavior.  
   - This fishery enables collaboration among governments, conservation groups, and recreational anglers to monitor and manage the species.  
   - Listing would **undermine this stewardship model** and reduce transparency and accountability in population management.  

3. **Population Status:**  
   - **Lower Fraser River population**: Relatively abundant with early signs of recovery (though spawning returns in 2005 were slightly below expectations).  
   - **Middle Fraser River population**: Naturally low abundance, constrained by habitat and food availability; currently stable but not expected to grow significantly.  

**Conservation Measures Already in Place:**  
- Existing protections under the *Fisheries Act* and other federal and provincial programs.  
- Long-standing recovery planning led by the **Province of British Columbia**, with support from DFO, Indigenous groups, and NGOs.  
- The federal government will continue to support these efforts through legal, funding, and policy mechanisms.  

**Conclusion:**  
- The two populations are not currently at imminent risk of extinction.  
- The socio-economic and cultural impacts of listing outweigh the conservation benefits.  
- Continued management through existing frameworks is both effective and sustainable.

### **4. Referral of Verna’s Flower Moth (*Schinia verna*) Assessment to COSEWIC**

**Species Involved:**  
Verna’s flower moth (*Schinia verna*) — a moth species whose status is currently under review.  

**Reason for Referral:**  
The assessment is being returned to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for further evaluation due to:  
- **Insufficient data** on:  
  - Species distribution  
  - Abundance  
  - Range size  
  - Habitat suitability  
  - Identified threats  
- **Lack of community or Indigenous knowledge** integration  
- Uncertainty in species boundaries or population definitions  
- Ambiguities in the scientific basis of the current status designation  

**Purpose of Referral:**  
- To gather **more comprehensive data**, especially on distribution and threats.  
- To ensure that any future listing decision is based on **robust, up-to-date, and inclusive scientific evidence**.  
- To allow COSEWIC to assess whether the species meets the criteria for listing under SARA.

### **Key Principles Underlying the Decisions**

1. **Balancing Conservation with Socioeconomic and Cultural Factors**  
   - The decisions reflect a careful balance between protecting biodiversity and respecting Indigenous rights, economic realities, and community-based knowledge systems.

2. **Use of Scientific and Traditional Knowledge**  
   - The role of **Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (ATK)** is emphasized, particularly in beluga and white sturgeon management.  
   - Decisions are not made in isolation from Indigenous communities.

3. **Precautionary Principle vs. Practicality**  
   - While the Act is precautionary, the government recognizes that **listing decisions must be practical and implementable**.  
   - In cases where listing would cause disproportionate harm (economic, cultural, or scientific), the decision to defer is justified.

4. **Ongoing Monitoring and Adaptive Management**  
   - All decisions are **not final**. They are conditional and subject to future review.
