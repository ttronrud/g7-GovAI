**Detailed Summary of the Marine Industries Limited Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Marine Industries Limited Regulations* (S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 3 and c. 90) are a set of government regulations established under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion** and approved by the **Treasury Board**. These regulations were enacted pursuant to specific provisions of the **Appropriation Acts** of 1980–81 and 1981–82, specifically **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote 1a** and **Vote 1e**, which authorized funding and support for industrial development.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **promote the growth of Marine Industries Limited (MIL)** and to **foster the expansion of Canadian trade** by providing insurance coverage for loans made by private lenders to MIL. This insurance mechanism aims to reduce financial risk for private lenders, thereby encouraging investment in a key Canadian industrial enterprise.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Marine Industries Limited (MIL)**  
   - Refers to a company incorporated under Canadian law with the name "Marine Industries Limited."  
   - Must have its **head office in Montreal, Quebec**.  
   - The regulations specifically target this company as the beneficiary of the insurance program.

2. **Minister**  
   - Refers to the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion**, responsible for overseeing the implementation and administration of the insurance program.

3. **Private Lender**  
   - Defined as any lender or its assignee who is **not**:
     - The Government of Canada,
     - The government of any province of Canada,
     - An agency of any of the above governments or any company effectively controlled by such governments or their agencies,
     - A municipal corporation.

   This definition ensures that only **private, non-governmental financial institutions** (such as banks, credit unions, or individual investors) are eligible to participate in the program.

### **Core Purpose and Scope**

The regulations establish a **government-backed insurance program** for loans extended by private lenders to Marine Industries Limited. The insurance is designed to:
- Encourage private investment in MIL,
- Support the development and expansion of marine-related industries in Canada,
- Promote Canadian trade by strengthening the competitiveness and stability of a key industrial sector.

The insurance is **not a direct loan** or grant, but rather a risk mitigation tool to protect private lenders against potential losses due to default or other financial failures in the loan portfolio.

### **Terms and Conditions of Insurance**

#### **1. Coverage Amount**
- The Minister provides insurance for **up to 100% of any loss** incurred by a private lender.
- However, the **aggregate total insurance coverage** is capped at **CAD 40 million** across all loans covered under the program.

> Example: If multiple private lenders are insured, the combined total of all losses covered by the Minister cannot exceed CAD 40 million.

#### **2. Insurance Fee**
- Private lenders must pay a **semi-annual fee** to the Minister.
- The fee is **0.5% per annum** of the **total amount of insurance in force**.
- The fee is **paid in advance**, meaning the lender pays before the insurance period begins or each six-month interval.

> This creates a predictable and ongoing financial commitment from private lenders to participate in the program.

#### **3. Payment by the Minister on Loss Demand**
When a private lender demands repayment of a loan that is insured under these regulations, the Minister will pay out **only up to the lesser of two amounts**:
- The **amount of insurance currently in force** on the date of the demand, **or**
- **100% of the actual loss** incurred by the private lender.

> This ensures that the Minister does not overpay and that the payout is limited by both the insurance coverage and the actual financial loss.

> Example:  
> - If the insurance in force is CAD 20 million, and the private lender suffers a loss of CAD 30 million, the Minister will pay only **CAD 20 million** (the lesser of the two).

#### **4. Reduction of Insurance Coverage**
- The private lender may **request a reduction** in the amount of insurance in force.
- This provision allows flexibility in the program, enabling lenders to adjust their exposure based on changing risk assessments, financial conditions, or strategic decisions.

> The Minister is not required to grant such reductions, but the right to request them is explicitly provided.

### **Legal and Policy Context**

- The regulations are rooted in **fiscal and industrial policy** aimed at regional development and economic growth.
- They reflect a common practice in government policy during the 1980s of using **risk-sharing mechanisms** to stimulate investment in strategic industries.
- The program is part of a broader framework of **industrial expansion initiatives** under the Ministry of Regional Industrial Expansion, which sought to support key manufacturing and export sectors.

### **Conclusion**

The *Marine Industries Limited Regulations* constitute a targeted, risk-managed financial instrument designed to:
- Encourage private capital investment in a critical Canadian industrial enterprise,
- Provide a safety net for lenders facing potential losses,
- Promote the growth of marine industries and Canadian trade,
- Operate within fiscal limits and accountability frameworks.

While the program is specific to Marine Industries Limited, its structure—featuring capped coverage, fee-based participation, and loss-based payouts—could serve as a model for future industrial development programs in Canada.

**Note**: These regulations are now historical in nature, as Marine Industries Limited may no longer be active, and such targeted insurance programs were largely phased out or restructured in later decades. However, they remain a significant example of government-industry risk-sharing in Canadian economic policy.
