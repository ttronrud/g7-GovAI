**Detailed Summary of the Prince Albert National Park of Canada Land Rents Remission Order**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Treasury Board**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the government to make land rent remission orders when it is deemed to be in the **public interest**.

The order specifically applies to **Prince Albert National Park of Canada**, focusing on a designated area within the park: the **12.39 hectare seasonal campground located in the visitor centre at Waskesiu**.

---

**Purpose of the Remission:**

The primary purpose of this remission is to **relieve lessees** (individuals or entities holding leasehold interests in public lands) of a portion of the land rent owed for their use of the seasonal campground. This action is intended to support public interest goals, potentially including:

- Encouraging sustainable tourism and visitor access;
- Supporting the economic viability of land use within national parks;
- Reducing financial burdens on lessees who may operate seasonal services (e.g., campgrounds, visitor services) in a park setting.

---

**Scope of the Remission:**

The remission applies to **all lessees** who hold a **leasehold interest in public lands** located within the **12.39 ha seasonal campground in the Waskesiu visitor centre** of Prince Albert National Park.

The leasehold rent is determined according to:

1. The **terms of the applicable lease agreement**; and  
2. **Paragraph 8(2)(a) or (8)(c)** of the *National Parks of Canada Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations*.

These regulatory provisions establish the framework under which leasehold rents are set and governed in national parks.

**Structure of the Remission Amounts (by Period):**

The remission is **not a full waiver** of rent, but a **proportional reduction** of the portion of the rental rate that exceeds a specified threshold of **$300.00 per year**.

The remission is structured over three consecutive fiscal years, with **progressively decreasing percentages**:

| Period | Remission Percentage | Condition |
|-------|------------------------|---------|
| **April 1, 2007 – March 31, 2008** | **75%** | Of the portion of the rental rate **above $300.00** |
| **April 1, 2008 – March 31, 2009** | **50%** | Of the portion of the rental rate **above $300.00** |
| **April 1, 2009 – March 31, 2010** | **25%** | Of the portion of the rental rate **above $300.00** |

> **Note**: The remission applies only to the **amount exceeding $300.00**. If the lease rate is $250 or less, no remission is due because there is no amount above the $300 threshold.

**Example Calculation:**

Suppose a leaseholder is charged $500 per year for the seasonal campground lease:

- Amount above $300 = $200
- For the 2007–2008 period: 75% of $200 = **$150** remitted
- For the 2008–2009 period: 50% of $200 = **$100** remitted
- For the 2009–2010 period: 25% of $200 = **$50** remitted

If the lease rate were $350, the excess is $50:
- 2007–2008: 75% × $50 = $37.50
- 2008–2009: 50% × $50 = $25
- 2009–2010: 25% × $50 = $12.50

---

**Key Features and Implications:**

1. **Time-Limited**: The remission is only valid for the specified three-year periods (2007–2010), and does not extend beyond March 31, 2010.
2. **Tiered Reduction**: The decreasing percentage reflects a phased approach—starting with a significant relief and tapering off over time—possibly signaling a temporary or transitional policy.
3. **Threshold-Based**: The $300.00 floor ensures that very low rental rates are not affected, preserving the financial integrity of leases that are already modest.
4. **Public Interest Justification**: The decision is grounded in public interest, suggesting that the government views this as a way to promote access, support local operators, or align with broader environmental or economic policy goals.
5. **Compliance with Regulatory Framework**: The order adheres to established lease and licensing regulations, ensuring legal and procedural consistency.

**Legal Citation:**

- **Statutory Reference**: *S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)*  
- This is a **statutory instrument** (a regulation) made under the *Financial Administration Act*, specifically subsection 23(2.1)a, which empowers the federal government to remit land rents when in the public interest.

**Conclusion:**

This remission order provides targeted financial relief to lessees of the Waskesiu seasonal campground within Prince Albert National Park. By reducing the rent owed for periods exceeding $300 annually—on a tiered basis over three years—the government supports sustainable land use and visitor access while remaining within the bounds of established regulatory and financial frameworks. It represents a short-term, interest-based policy intervention aimed at balancing conservation objectives with economic realities for land users.
