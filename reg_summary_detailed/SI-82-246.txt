**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Goods for Production of Aircraft Components Remission Order No. 2**

---

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**. It is made pursuant to **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the government to grant remissions of customs duties for specific purposes, particularly when such remission supports national economic or strategic interests.

---

**2. Title of the Order**  
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Goods for Production of Aircraft Components Remission Order No. 2"**  
This designation allows the Order to be formally referenced and cited in future legal, administrative, or tax proceedings.

---

**3. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., forgive or reduce) customs duties** that were previously paid or would have been payable on certain imported goods. These goods are used **exclusively in the production of components for specific aircraft models**. The remission is intended to support the development, maintenance, and manufacturing of aircraft for Canada’s civil and military aviation sectors.

---

**4. Scope of Goods Covered**  
The remission applies to **goods imported into Canada** during the period from **January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1985**.  

However, **specific exclusions** are made:  
Goods classified under the following Customs Tariff items are **not eligible** for remission:  
- 42700-1 to 42700-9  
- 42701-1 and 42701-2  

This means that the remission applies to **all other goods** under the Customs Tariff that fall outside these specific classifications.

**5. Eligible Aircraft Types**  
The imported goods must be used **exclusively** in the production of components for aircraft of the following types:

#### a) Boeing Aircraft:
- Boeing 707  
- Boeing 727  
- Boeing 737  
- Boeing 747  
- Boeing 747SP  
- Boeing 757  
- Boeing 767  

#### b) Douglas Aircraft:
- Douglas DC-8  
- Douglas DC-9  
- Douglas DC-10  

#### c) CF-18 and F-18 (Military Aircraft):
- CF-18 (Canadian Forces variant of the F-18)  
- F-18 (U.S. variant, used in Canadian operations)

#### d) Lockheed Aircraft:
- Lockheed L-1011 (triple-deck commercial airliner)  
- CP-140 (Canadian patrol aircraft)  
- P-3 (Canadian maritime patrol aircraft)

> **Note**: The term "components" refers to parts, subassemblies, or materials used in the manufacturing or repair of these aircraft, not the finished aircraft themselves.

**6. Conditions for Remission**  
To qualify for the remission, the following **conditions must be met**:

- The goods must have been **imported between January 1, 1983, and December 31, 1985**.  
- The goods must have been used **exclusively** in the production of components for the listed aircraft types.  
- A **formal claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue**.  
- The claim must be made **within three years of the date of importation**.  

Failure to submit a claim within this three-year window will result in the **loss of eligibility** for remission.

**7. Key Implications**  
- **Economic and Strategic Rationale**: This Order supports Canada’s aerospace industry by reducing the cost of critical inputs for aircraft component manufacturing. It helps maintain domestic capacity for aircraft maintenance, repair, and modernization—particularly for aging fleets or military aircraft.  
- **Historical Context**: The period (1983–1985) predates the widespread use of modern digital manufacturing and global supply chains, suggesting that this remission may have been part of a broader effort to strengthen Canada’s domestic aerospace capabilities during a time of transition in the aviation industry.  
- **Limited Scope**: The exclusions indicate that certain high-value or sensitive goods (e.g., those in the 42700 and 42701 series) were deemed to require continued tariff control, possibly due to concerns about trade balance, security, or economic diversification.  

---

**8. Enforcement and Compliance**  
- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for receiving and processing claims.  
- The government may require documentation to verify that the goods were used exclusively in aircraft component production.  
- The Order does not alter the original customs duty liability; it only provides a **remission** (a reduction or waiver) of the duty paid or payable.  

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a targeted, time-limited, and conditionally granted remission of customs duties designed to support Canada’s domestic aerospace manufacturing and maintenance capabilities during a specific historical period. It reflects a strategic government intervention to ensure the availability of essential materials for the production of components for key aircraft types, particularly those used in civil and defense aviation. The requirement for timely claims ensures accountability and prevents indefinite or uncontrolled duty waivers.

This Order serves as a historical example of how governments may use tariff remission policies to support national industrial and strategic interests in the aviation sector.
