**Detailed Summary of the *Nova Scotia Share of Offshore Revenue Interim Period Payment Regulations* (S.C. 1983-84, c. 29)**

---

### **Background and Context**

These regulations were issued under the **Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act** (the "Act") to establish the mechanism for the interim payment of Nova Scotia’s share of offshore revenue from oil and gas activities in shared offshore areas. The regulations are specifically designed to address transitional financial obligations arising before certain key provisions of the Act came into force.

The regulatory framework was developed in response to a formal request made on **October 18, 1984**, when a draft version of the proposed *Nova Scotia Share of Offshore Revenue Interim Period Payment Regulations* was submitted to two Nova Scotia ministers:
- The **Minister of Finance**
- The **Minister of Mines and Energy**

Under subsection **70(2)** of the Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act, such proposals must be forwarded to the federal government for review and approval.

Crucially, the two Nova Scotia ministers **agreed to waive the 30-day review period** normally required under **subsection 58(3)** of the Act. This waiver was granted to expedite the implementation of the interim payment mechanism, recognizing the urgency of establishing a clear financial arrangement for Nova Scotia’s share of offshore revenues during a transitional phase.

### **Legal Authority and Adoption**

The regulations were formally adopted by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, based on:
- A **joint recommendation** from the **Minister of Finance** and the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, pursuant to **subparagraph 70(1)(a)(i)** of the Act.
- A **recommendation** from the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources** under **subparagraph 70(1)(b)(ii)** of the Act.

This demonstrates that the decision to issue the regulations was made jointly by federal and provincial authorities, with the federal government exercising its statutory authority to implement the agreement’s financial provisions.

The regulations are officially titled:
> **Nova Scotia Share of Offshore Revenue Interim Period Payment Regulations**

They are cited as **S.C. 1983-84, c. 29**.

### **Key Definitions and Provisions**

#### 1. **Definition of "Act"**
- The term *"Act"* refers to the *Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act*, which governs the division of offshore oil and gas revenues between Canada and Nova Scotia.

#### 2. **Definition of "Minister"**
- The term *"Minister"* refers to the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources** (the federal minister responsible for overseeing energy and resource policy).

### **Core Financial Mechanism: Transfer of Estimated Offshore Revenue**

The regulations establish a process for the **transfer of estimated offshore revenue amounts** to the **Revenue Fund** and, subsequently, to **Her Majesty in Right of Nova Scotia**.

#### **Section 1: Transfer of Estimated Offshore Revenue – Fiscal Year Preceding Part VI of the Act**
> Where the Minister of Finance estimates the amount referred to in **paragraph (e)** of the definition of "offshore revenue" in subsection 63(1) of the Act **for a fiscal year during the term of the Agreement before Part VI of the Act came into force**, the Minister shall transfer such amount to the **Revenue Fund**.

- **Interpretation**:
  - Paragraph (e) of subsection 63(1) defines "offshore revenue" as including certain revenues from oil and gas operations in shared offshore areas.
  - This provision applies to fiscal years prior to the implementation of **Part VI** of the Act (which likely introduced more detailed revenue-sharing or administrative mechanisms).
  - The transfer ensures that Nova Scotia receives its equitable share of offshore revenues even during the transitional phase when formal revenue-sharing mechanisms were not yet fully operational.

#### **Section 2: Transfer of Estimated Offshore Revenue – Fiscal Year Preceding Part II of the Act**
> Where the Minister of Finance estimates the amount referred to in **paragraph (f)** of the definition of "offshore revenue" in subsection 63(1) of the Act **for a fiscal year during the term of the Agreement before Part II of the Act came into force**, the Minister shall transfer such amount to the **Revenue Fund**.

- **Interpretation**:
  - Paragraph (f) likely refers to a specific category of offshore revenue (e.g., royalties, production-related payments, or other direct revenue streams).
  - This provision covers fiscal years prior to the implementation of **Part II** of the Act, which may have introduced new revenue-sharing rules or fiscal frameworks.
  - Again, the purpose is to ensure Nova Scotia receives its fair share of offshore revenue during the transitional period.

#### **Section 3: Payment to Her Majesty in Right of Nova Scotia**
> Where any amount has been transferred to the Revenue Fund pursuant to section 3 or 4, the Minister shall **forthwith pay** such amount to **Her Majesty in Right of Nova Scotia**.

- **Interpretation**:
  - Once the estimated revenue is transferred into the **Revenue Fund**, it must be **immediately paid** to the Crown (specifically, to Nova Scotia’s share of the revenue).
  - This ensures timely and transparent financial accountability.
  - The term "Her Majesty in Right of Nova Scotia" refers to the Crown’s legal representative in Nova Scotia, meaning the payment is made to the provincial government as a form of revenue entitlement.

### **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve as a **transitional financial mechanism** to ensure that Nova Scotia receives its **proportional share of offshore oil and gas revenues** during a period when the full structure of revenue sharing under the Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act had not yet been fully implemented.

Key objectives include:
- Providing **financial stability** and **predictability** for Nova Scotia during the early years of the Agreement.
- Ensuring compliance with the **principles of equity and shared benefit** established in the Agreement.
- Facilitating a **smooth transition** from interim arrangements to formal revenue-sharing mechanisms under later parts of the Act (Part II and Part VI).

| **Transitional Nature** | Applies only to fiscal years before key parts of the Act (Part II and Part VI) came into force. |
| **Funding Pathway** | Revenue is first estimated and transferred to the Revenue Fund, then immediately paid to Nova Scotia. |
| **Federal Oversight** | The federal Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources has key authority in recommending and approving the regulations. |
| **Accountability** | Clear procedural steps ensure transparency and timely disbursement of funds. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Nova Scotia Share of Offshore Revenue Interim Period Payment Regulations* are a critical component of the Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement, designed to ensure that Nova Scotia receives its fair share of offshore revenues during a transitional phase when formal revenue-sharing mechanisms were not yet in place.

By establishing a clear, legally binding process for estimating, transferring, and disbursing offshore revenue, the regulations:
- Uphold the financial equity of the Agreement,
- Provide a practical framework for interim payments,
- Demonstrate cooperation between federal and provincial governments,
- And lay the groundwork for more comprehensive revenue-sharing arrangements in later stages of the Agreement.

These regulations remain a foundational element in the ongoing management of offshore oil and gas revenue in the Canada-Nova Scotia relationship.
