**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Speckled Dace (Rhinichthys osculus) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulatory instrument, titled the *Critical Habitat of the Speckled Dace (Rhinichthys osculus) Order*, is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, a federal Canadian law designed to prevent the extinction of wildlife species at risk and to promote their recovery.

- The **Speckled Dace (*Rhinichthys osculus*)** is a species of freshwater fish native to Canada, specifically found in certain streams and rivers across southern Ontario and parts of the northeastern United States.
- It has been officially designated as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** of SARA. This classification means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

---

**2. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**

- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Speckled Dace was developed and approved by the federal government. This strategy outlines the actions necessary to recover the species and includes a detailed identification of its **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery.
- The critical habitat identified in this strategy has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to ensure transparency and public awareness about species at risk and their designated critical habitats.

**3. Legal Basis for the Order**

The Order is issued pursuant to **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*:

- **Subsection 58(4)** authorizes the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate critical habitat for a species listed under SARA, provided that the designation is based on the recovery strategy and is supported by scientific evidence.
- **Subsection 58(5)** allows the Minister to issue an Order to formally establish and define the boundaries of the critical habitat.

Additionally, **subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Speckled Dace, meaning that all activities that could adversely affect this habitat are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may require permits or mitigation measures.

**4. Key Provisions of the Order**

- The Order **formally designates and defines** the specific geographic areas that constitute the **critical habitat** of the Speckled Dace (*Rhinichthys osculus*).
- These areas are derived from the recovery strategy and are now legally recognized as essential for the species’ survival and recovery.
- The Order explicitly **excludes any portion of the designated critical habitat** from being located in a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA. This provision is significant because it prevents the Minister from being required to designate critical habitat in areas that are already subject to certain exemptions (e.g., areas where development is not permitted or where the species is not present).

This exclusion ensures that the critical habitat designation is focused on areas where the species is actually found and where its survival is most at risk.

**5. Regulatory Effect and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., upon publication in the *Canada Gazette*).
- Once in force, the designated critical habitat becomes legally protected under SARA. Any federal or provincial activity that may result in the **degradation, destruction, or disturbance** of this habitat is subject to:
  - Environmental assessment requirements;
  - Permitting processes;
  - Mitigation measures;
  - Compliance with recovery goals.

- The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Order and ensuring that activities affecting the habitat are conducted in a manner that does not harm the species.

---

**6. Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- Provide **legal protection** to the specific areas essential for the survival of the Speckled Dace;
- Support the **recovery of the species** by ensuring that its habitat remains intact and undisturbed;
- Promote **conservation planning** and coordination between federal, provincial, and Indigenous partners;
- Increase **public awareness** and accountability through the inclusion of the designation in the Species at Risk Public Registry.

---

**7. Legal References and Amendments**

- The Order is based on and references:
  - *S.C. 2002, c. 29*: The original *Species at Risk Act*;
  - *S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60*: A legislative amendment that strengthened the powers of the Minister to designate critical habitat and clarified the process for doing so.

---

**Conclusion**

This Critical Habitat Order is a critical step in the conservation of the endangered Speckled Dace. By formally identifying and protecting its essential habitat, the Government of Canada is fulfilling its legal and ecological responsibilities under SARA. The Order ensures that future development, land use, and environmental activities are evaluated for their potential impact on this vulnerable species, contributing directly to its long-term survival and recovery.
