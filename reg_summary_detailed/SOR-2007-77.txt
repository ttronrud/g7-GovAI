**Detailed Summary of the Pacific Fishery Management Area Regulations, 2007**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Enactment**
The *Pacific Fishery Management Area Regulations, 2007* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**. This action is grounded in **Section 43a of the Fisheries Act**, which empowers the federal government to establish and regulate fishery management areas in Canadian waters.

This regulatory instrument serves to formally define and designate specific regions—known as *management areas*—within the Canadian Pacific Ocean fisheries waters, enabling the implementation of science-based, region-specific fisheries management measures.

---

### **2. Scope of Application**
- These regulations apply exclusively to **Canadian fisheries waters in the Pacific Ocean**.
- The regulations are designed to provide a structured framework for managing fish stocks, ensuring sustainability, and supporting conservation efforts in this vast and ecologically significant region.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Fishing Zone** | Defined identically to its meaning under the *Oceans Act*. This refers to a designated area within Canadian waters where fishing activities are permitted or regulated. |
| **Management Area (or "Area")** | A formally designated division of Canadian fisheries waters. These areas are listed and described in **Schedule 2**. Each management area includes the portion of any stream that flows into it and extends seaward from the **mean high water mark near the mouth of the stream**. This ensures that riverine and estuarine systems are included in the management framework. |
| **Mile** | Refers to a **nautical mile**, a unit of measurement used in maritime navigation and fisheries management. |
| **Shoreline** | Defined as the **apparent high water mark**, which is the visible line where the land meets the sea at high tide. This provides a practical boundary for defining coastal zones. |
| **Subarea** | A smaller, more specific subdivision within a larger management area. Subareas allow for more granular management and monitoring. |
| **Surfline** | Refers to specific boundary lines described in **Schedule 1**. These lines define the edges or limits of management areas and subareas. |

> **Geographic Reference System**:  
> All geographic coordinates referenced in the schedules are based on the **North American Datum 83 (NAD 83)**, the standard geodetic system used in Canada for accurate mapping and spatial data.  
> All lines connecting coordinates are interpreted as **rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing), which are used in navigation and mapping to approximate straight-line paths across the ocean.

### **4. Designation of Management Areas**
- The **management areas** are formally prescribed in **Schedule 2**.
- These areas are geographically delineated and represent distinct regions of Canadian Pacific fisheries waters.
- The inclusion of the **portion of streams flowing into each area**, extending seaward from the **mean high water mark near the mouth**, ensures that coastal and estuarine habitats are integrated into the management framework. This is important because these zones often support critical fish spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds.

---

### **5. Regulatory Effect and Implementation**
- The regulations **come into force on the day of registration** with the *Canada Gazette*, meaning they are immediately effective upon official publication.
- The regulations do **not contain any immediate operational provisions** (such as catch limits or fishing methods) but instead establish the **geographic framework** upon which future fisheries management decisions—such as quotas, access rights, or seasonal closures—can be based.

---

### **6. Repeal Note**
- The text includes a **[Repeal]** annotation, indicating that this regulation may have been intended to replace or supersede earlier versions of similar regulations. However, without further context, it is unclear whether this refers to a specific prior regulation or is a placeholder. In practice, such annotations often signal that the new regulation is being introduced to modernize or replace outdated provisions.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**
These regulations serve as the **foundation for regional fisheries management** in Canada’s Pacific waters. By clearly defining management areas and subareas, the regulations:
- Enable the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to implement targeted conservation and management strategies.
- Support ecosystem-based management by recognizing the spatial complexity of marine and estuarine environments.
- Provide a legal basis for future rules on fishing rights, access, gear restrictions, and stock assessments.
- Promote transparency and consistency in how Canadian waters are managed across different jurisdictions.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Pacific Fishery Management Area Regulations, 2007* establish a clear, geographically precise framework for managing Canadian fisheries in the Pacific Ocean. By defining management areas, subareas, and key boundaries using standardized geographic systems, the regulations lay the groundwork for sustainable, science-based fisheries policy. While the regulations themselves are largely descriptive and structural, they are essential precursors to more detailed management rules that govern fishing activities, species protection, and marine conservation in the region.
