**Detailed Summary of the Satellites and Satellite Subsystems Remission Order, 1982**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation, known as the *Satellites and Satellite Subsystems Remission Order, 1982*, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision grants the government the authority to make or revoke orders related to customs duties, particularly in cases involving public interest, economic development, or strategic national interests.

The order revokes an earlier regulation—*the Electronic Subsystems for Communication Satellites Remission Order* (Order in Council P.C. 1980-1677, dated June 19, 1980)—and replaces it with a new, broader, and more specific remission order.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **remit (i.e., exempt from payment) customs duties** on certain goods imported into Canada that are used in the **manufacture of satellites and satellite subsystems for export**. This measure supports Canada’s strategic development in the aerospace and space technology sectors by reducing the cost of key components used in satellite production.

### **Scope of the Remission**

- **Goods Covered**:  
  The remission applies to **goods imported into Canada** during a specific period:  
  **From March 30, 1980, to December 31, 1987**.

- **Exclusions**:  
  The remission **does not apply** to goods classified under **tariff items 42700-1 and 42701-1** of the *Customs Tariff*. These items are explicitly excluded, likely due to their specific nature or because they may be subject to different policy considerations (e.g., security, strategic importance, or different economic rationale).

- **Use Requirement**:  
  The goods must be used **exclusively or primarily in the manufacture of satellites or satellite subsystems**. The remission is conditional upon the final product being intended for **export**.

---

### **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for the remission, the following **condition must be met**:

- A **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue** within **three years of the date of importation**.

This deadline ensures timely administrative processing and prevents indefinite delays in duty recovery or claims. Failure to file a claim within this period results in the **loss of the remission benefit**.

---

### **Legal Citation and Effective Date**

- The Order is officially cited as:  
  **Satellites and Satellite Subsystems Remission Order, 1982** (SI/80-119, 1980 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 2395).

- Although the citation references 1980, the Order was **issued in 1982** and thus represents a revised and updated policy.

### **Key Implications and Context**

1. **Economic and Strategic Rationale**:  
   The remission supports Canada’s participation in the global space industry by reducing the cost of imported components. This helps Canadian companies (such as those in the aerospace sector) remain competitive in international satellite manufacturing.

2. **Support for Export-Oriented Industry**:  
   The requirement that goods be used in the production of **exportable satellite systems** ensures that the remission benefits only those goods contributing to Canada’s export capacity, not domestic consumption.

3. **Temporal Limitation**:  
   The remission is limited to the period from **March 30, 1980, to December 31, 1987**. This suggests the policy was designed to support a specific phase of technological development or investment in the space sector during that era.

4. **Administrative Burden**:  
   The three-year claim deadline balances the need for fiscal accountability with the practical challenges of tracking long-term manufacturing and export activities.

5. **Revocation of Previous Order**:  
   The revocation of the 1980 order indicates a shift in policy scope or intent—likely to expand eligibility or clarify the criteria for remission, making it more aligned with evolving satellite manufacturing needs.

### **Conclusion**

The *Satellites and Satellite Subsystems Remission Order, 1982* is a targeted customs duty exemption designed to promote Canada’s competitiveness in the global satellite manufacturing industry. It provides a temporary, time-limited remission of customs duties on qualifying imported goods used in the production of exportable satellites and subsystems—excluding specific tariff items—subject to a mandatory claim filing within three years of importation.

This regulation reflects a government strategy to support high-tech, export-driven industries through targeted fiscal incentives, while maintaining fiscal responsibility and administrative oversight.

**Note**: This order is no longer in force as of 1988, as it was superseded by later regulations. However, it remains historically significant as a key policy instrument in Canada’s space technology development during the 1980s.
