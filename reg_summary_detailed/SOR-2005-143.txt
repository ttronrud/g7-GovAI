### **Detailed Summary of the "Use of Patented Products for International Humanitarian Purposes Regulations"**

This regulation, made under **section 12b of the Patent Act** and effective upon the coming into force of **S.C. 2004, c. 23 (The Jean Chrétien Pledge to Africa)**, establishes a legal framework to allow the **non-commercial, humanitarian export of patented pharmaceutical products and medical devices** to countries in need—particularly in developing nations—where access to essential medicines is limited due to economic or logistical constraints.

The regulation is grounded in **section 21.04 of the Patent Act**, which permits the issuance of authorizations for the export of patented products for humanitarian purposes, provided that such use is **non-commercial** and serves **humanitarian objectives**. The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, enacted these rules to ensure clarity, consistency, and transparency in the application and administration of these authorizations.

## **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

- **Objective**: To enable the export of patented pharmaceutical products and medical devices to low-income or humanitarian-affected countries under strict humanitarian conditions, without requiring commercial licensing or payment of royalties.
- **Legal Authority**:
  - **Section 21.04(1)a** of the Patent Act allows for authorizations for humanitarian and non-commercial use.
  - **Section 21.08(2)a** provides that the Governor in Council may consider humanitarian and non-commercial reasons when granting such authorizations.
  - The regulation is made under **section 12b of the Patent Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to create regulations to implement the purposes of section 21.04.

### **D. Royalty Payment Rules (Section 21.08)**

A royalty is required to be paid to patentees **only if** the product is exported in a commercial context or under certain conditions. However, **royalty is not required** for humanitarian exports under section 21.04(1)a — this is a key distinction.

However, **the regulation provides detailed royalty calculation rules** for reference, which apply in commercial scenarios:

#### **1. Royalty Calculation Based on the Human Development Index (HDI)**

- **If the destination country appears on the UN Human Development Index (HDI)**:
  - Royalty rate =  
    `(1 + total number of countries on HDI)`  
    − `(numerical rank of destination country on HDI)`  
    ÷ `(total number of countries on HDI)`  
    × `0.04`

- **If the destination country does NOT appear on the HDI**:
  - Royalty rate is calculated based on **average ranks** of similar countries in relevant schedules:
    - **Schedule 2 or 3 (countries)**: average rank of countries in same schedule and on HDI.
    - **Schedule 4 (WTO Members)**: average rank of WTO Members in same schedule and on HDI.
  - Formula is identical to above.

> **Note**: These formulas are **only for reference** and do **not apply** to humanitarian exports under section 21.04(1)a. In those cases, **no royalty is payable**.

#### **2. Amount of Royalty**

- For **one patentee**:  
  Total value of agreement (in CAD) × royalty rate.

- For **multiple patentees**:  
  Divide the total amount by the number of patentees.

> These rules are included to ensure consistency in commercial licensing, not to apply to humanitarian exports.

### **E. Declaration Requirements (Key Subsections of Section 21.04(3))**

Applicants must make several **formal declarations** to demonstrate compliance with humanitarian and non-commercial criteria.

#### **Declaration (21.04(3)(c)) – Efforts to Obtain a License**
- At least **30 days before filing**, the applicant must have:
  - Sent a **written request** (via certified mail) to each patentee for a license to manufacture and sell the product for export.
  - The request must contain **all information required under paragraphs 21.04(2)(a) to (g)**.
- The applicant must declare that **no license was obtained** under reasonable terms and conditions.

> This ensures that the applicant did not have a commercial alternative and that the export is genuinely humanitarian.

#### **Declaration (21.04(3)(d)(i)(A) and (B)) – WTO Member Requirement**
- The product must be:
  - Specified in a **written notice** provided by the WTO Member to the TRIPS Council.
  - **Not patented** in that WTO Member.

#### **Declaration (21.04(3)(d)(ii)(A) and (B)) – Country Requirement**
- The product must be:
  - Specified in a **written notice** from the country to the Government of Canada.
  - **Not patented** in that country.

> These declarations confirm that the product is legally available and not restricted in the destination country.

---

### **F. Renewal of Authorization**

- **Renewal Application** (Form 10): Must be signed by the holder of the authorization.
- **Renewed Authorization** (Form 11): Issued by the Commissioner under section 21.12.

> This allows for continued humanitarian exports beyond the initial authorization period, provided ongoing compliance is demonstrated.

### **G. Price Reference for Average Price (Section 21.17(6))**

For reference in pricing calculations (not applicable to humanitarian exports), the following sources are recognized as valid price references:

1. **Ontario Drug Benefit Formulary / Comparative Drug Index** (Ministry of Health, Ontario)
2. **List of Insured Medications** (Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec – "List of Medications")
3. **PPS Buyers Guide** (ProActive Pharma Solutions), including its PPS Centrus section

> These are used to determine average prices in Canada
