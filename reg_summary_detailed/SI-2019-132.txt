### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Youth and LGBTQ2 Secretariats**

**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), which grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the power to reassign control and supervision of certain public administration functions within the federal government.

**Key Provision:**  
On the recommendation of the Prime Minister, the Governor General in Council transfers:

- The **control and supervision** of the following units within the **Privy Council Office (PCO)**:
  - The **Youth Secretariat**
  - The **LGBTQ2 Secretariat**

**Transfer Destination:**  
These units are transferred from the **Privy Council Office** to the **Department of Canadian Heritage (DCH)**.

### **Purpose and Context**

This transfer reflects a strategic realignment of federal government structures to enhance the delivery of policies and services related to youth and LGBTQ2+ communities. By moving these secretariats to the Department of Canadian Heritage, the government aims to:

- Strengthen coordination and continuity in developing and implementing policies that support youth and LGBTQ2+ populations.
- Ensure that these initiatives are integrated with broader cultural, social, and heritage-related priorities under the DCH’s mandate.
- Improve accountability, resource allocation, and policy development through a department with a direct focus on cultural diversity, inclusion, and social equity.

### **Implications of the Transfer**

1. **Administrative Oversight:**  
   The Department of Canadian Heritage assumes full administrative, operational, and supervisory responsibility for both secretariats, including staffing, budgeting, reporting, and strategic planning.

2. **Policy Development:**  
   The Youth and LGBTQ2+ Secretariats will now operate under the policy framework and priorities of the Department of Canadian Heritage, which is responsible for:
   - Promoting multiculturalism and inclusion
   - Supporting Indigenous and minority communities
   - Advancing gender equity and LGBTQ2+ rights
   - Developing youth engagement strategies

3. **Continuity of Services:**  
   While the transfer is administrative, the core functions—such as policy research, stakeholder engagement, data collection, and program development—will remain largely unchanged to ensure continuity in service delivery.

4. **Reporting Lines:**  
   The secretariats will now report to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, rather than to the Minister of the Privy Council Office or the Clerk of the Privy Council.

5. **Legal and Procedural Compliance:**  
   The transfer is consistent with the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, which allows for the reallocation of functions to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and alignment with national policy goals.
