### **Overview**

The *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Examination Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under the **Department of Justice Act** to ensure that proposed legislation (Bills) and regulatory instruments (regulations) are reviewed for compliance with the **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**. These regulations formalize the process by which the Minister of Justice examines proposed laws and rules to determine whether any provisions contravene the Charter’s protections.

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Constitutional Accountability**:
   - Ensures that all legislative and regulatory actions are subject to Charter review, reinforcing the rule of law.

2. **Transparency and Public Confidence**:
   - The requirement to issue certificates and reports increases transparency in the legislative and regulatory process.

3. **Early Warning System**:
   - Identifies potential Charter violations early, allowing for amendments or reconsideration before laws take effect.

4. **Separation of Powers**:
   - The Minister of Justice acts as an independent constitutional gatekeeper, not a policymaker, ensuring that Charter rights are not compromised by executive action.

5. **Parliamentary Oversight**:
   - Reports are delivered to the Clerk of the House of Commons, enabling Parliament to review and respond to Charter concerns.

### **Legal Basis**

- The regulations are made under **section 4.1 of the Department of Justice Act**, which empowers the Minister to examine Bills and regulations for consistency with the Charter.

---

### **Important Notes**

- The regulations **do not prevent** a Bill or regulation from being passed or adopted if it is found to be inconsistent with the Charter. However, the **reporting requirement** ensures that such inconsistencies are formally documented and brought to the attention of Parliament.
- The **Deputy Minister of Justice** must sign the examination certificates, adding a layer of administrative accountability.
- The process applies to **all** Bills and regulations, regardless of subject matter, as long as they relate to rights and freedoms protected by the Charter.

### **Conclusion**

The *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Examination Regulations* serve as a critical safeguard in Canada’s constitutional framework. By mandating that the Minister of Justice examine all proposed legislation and regulations for Charter compliance, the regulations ensure that government actions respect fundamental rights and freedoms.
