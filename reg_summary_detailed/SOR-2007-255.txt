### **Detailed Summary of the Eligible Financial Contract Regulations (Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 39.15(8)a of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (CDIC Act)**.

**Purpose**:  
To define and prescribe which financial contracts qualify as **"eligible financial contracts"** under the CDIC Act. This is critical because the CDIC provides deposit insurance to banks and other financial institutions, and only certain financial instruments are considered eligible for coverage under the insurance program. This regulation establishes the scope of such eligible contracts.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

Two core definitions are introduced in the regulation:

##### **(a) Derivatives Agreement**
A **derivatives agreement** is any financial contract whose obligations are derived from, referenced to, or based on one or more **underlying reference items**. These include:
- Interest rates  
- Financial indices  
- Currencies  
- Commodities  
- Securities or ownership interests  
- Credit or guarantee obligations  
- Debt securities  
- Climatic variables  
- Bandwidth  
- Freight rates  
- Emission rights

> *Note*: This definition is broad and encompasses a wide range of instruments commonly used in financial markets.

A **financial intermediary** refers to:
- A **clearing agency**, or  
- A person (such as a **broker**, **bank**, or **trust company**) that, in the ordinary course of business, maintains **securities accounts** or **futures accounts** for others.

> *Purpose*: This definition identifies entities that play a central role in facilitating financial transactions and are subject to specific treatment in the context of margin loans and settlement activities.

---

#### **3. Prescribed Eligible Financial Contracts**

Under **subsection 39.15(9)** of the CDIC Act, the following types of financial agreements are explicitly recognized as **eligible financial contracts**. These are the instruments that may be covered under CDIC deposit insurance.

The list includes:

##### **(a) Derivatives Agreements**
- Any derivatives agreement (whether settled by **payment** or **delivery**) that:
  - Trades on a **futures or options exchange** or **regulated market**, or  
  - Is subject to **recurrent dealings** in derivatives markets (including over-the-counter markets for securities or commodities).

> *Key point*: The contract must be actively traded or regularly transacted in a regulated environment to qualify.

##### **(b) Agreements to Borrow or Lend Securities or Commodities**
- Agreements to:
  - Borrow or lend securities or commodities  
  - Transfer securities or commodities under which the borrower may repay the loan with **other securities, commodities, cash, or cash equivalents**

> *Example*: A bank lending shares to a client who will repay with another stock or cash.

##### **(c) Clearing or Settlement Agreements**
- Agreements to:
  - Clear or settle securities, futures, options, or derivatives transactions  
  - Act as a **depository** for securities  

> *Note*: This covers operational arrangements that facilitate the settlement of trades.

##### **(d) Repurchase, Reverse Repurchase, or Buy-Sellback Agreements**
- Agreements involving:
  - **Repurchase agreements (repos)**  
  - **Reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos)**  
  - **Buy-sellback agreements**  
  - With respect to **securities or commodities**

> *Purpose*: These are short-term lending arrangements where an asset is temporarily transferred and repurchased at a later date.

##### **(e) Margin Loans**
- Margin loans are eligible **only if** they relate to:
  - A **securities account** or **futures account** maintained by a **financial intermediary**

> *Note*: This limits eligibility to margin loans made in the course of a financial intermediary’s normal business activities. Personal or non-intermediary margin loans are not covered.

##### **(f) Combinations of the Above**
- Any **combination** of agreements listed in paragraphs (a) to (e) may also be considered eligible.

> *Example*: A portfolio of derivatives and repo agreements held together in a single transaction.

##### **(g) Master Agreements**
- A **master agreement** is eligible if it governs:
  - An agreement referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (e), or  
  - A master agreement that governs another master agreement (i.e., a "master of masters")

> *Purpose*: This allows for standardized, long-term frameworks (like ISDA master agreements) to be included in the eligible scope, as long as they cover eligible underlying contracts.

##### **(h) Guarantees, Indemnities, or Reimbursement Obligations**
- A **guarantee**, **indemnity**, or **reimbursement obligation** with respect to the liabilities under any of the agreements listed in paragraphs (a) to (g) is eligible.

> *Example*: A bank providing a guarantee to cover losses from a derivatives transaction.

##### **(i) Agreements Relating to Financial Collateral**
- Any agreement involving:
  - Financial collateral  
  - Security or security interest in collateral  
  - Title transfer credit support agreements  
  - Related to any of the agreements in paragraphs (a) to (h)

> *Purpose*: This ensures that collateral arrangements used to secure financial obligations (e.g., margin calls, repo transactions) are recognized as eligible under the CDIC framework.

---

#### **4. Regulatory Timeline and Enforcement**

- **Effective Date**:  
  These regulations come into force on the day that **subsection 103(2) of the Budget Implementation Act, 2007, chapter 29 of the Statutes of Canada, 2007** comes into force.

> *Note*: This means the regulations are not effective immediately upon publication. Their enforcement is tied to the broader legislative framework introduced by the 2007 budget.

- **Reference to Prior Version**:  
  The regulations were in force as of **November 17, 2007** (see SI/2007-105), indicating that they were part of a broader regulatory update to strengthen the CDIC’s ability to cover financial institutions in times of crisis.

### **Key Implications and Context**

1. **CDIC Insurance Coverage**:  
   The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that **deposit insurance** can cover not only traditional bank deposits but also certain **financial instruments** held by financial institutions. This expands the scope of protection to include complex financial products used in modern banking and investment.

2. **Market Stability and Risk Management**:  
   By including derivatives, repos, and margin loans, the regulations help maintain financial stability. They allow institutions to manage risk through hedging and liquidity tools while still being protected under the deposit insurance regime.

3. **Regulatory Clarity**:  
   The detailed definition of eligible contracts provides clarity for banks, brokers, and financial intermediaries on what types of agreements are covered. This reduces ambiguity and helps institutions design their financial structures within the regulatory framework.

4. **Focus on Intermediary Activity**:  
   The eligibility of margin loans and clearing agreements is restricted to **financial intermediaries**, which reflects a focus on institutional, rather than retail, financial activity. This helps prevent misuse of the insurance regime for speculative or personal financial instruments.

5. **Inclusion of Master Agreements and Collateral**:  
   The inclusion of master agreements and collateral arrangements is significant. It allows large, complex financial contracts to be treated as a single unit, simplifying risk assessment and insurance coverage.

### **Conclusion**

The **Eligible Financial Contract Regulations** under the CDIC Act represent a critical step in modernizing Canada’s deposit insurance framework. By clearly defining which financial instruments qualify as "eligible," the regulations:

- Expand the scope of CDIC protection to include complex, market-based financial tools  
- Provide regulatory certainty for financial institutions  
- Support financial market stability by enabling risk management through derivatives and collateral  
- Ensure that only properly structured, market-based transactions are covered  

This regulatory framework reflects a balance between **financial innovation** and **systemic risk management**, ensuring that deposit insurance remains both effective and appropriate in a dynamic financial environment.
