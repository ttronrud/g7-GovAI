**Detailed Summary of the Regulation on Public Inquiries into Objections to Proposed Incorporations, Continuances, and Amalgamations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

This regulation was issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 25(5) of the Trust and Loan Companies Act (TLC Act)**. It establishes the procedural framework governing **public inquiries** conducted by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** when an objection is made to a proposed:

- Incorporation  
- Continuance  
- Amalgamation  

of a trust or loan company.

> **Note:** This regulation was originally enacted in **1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 45)** and was **repealed in part** by **SOR/98-535, s. 2** (specifically, sections 4 and the related provisions). However, the core procedural rules—particularly those relating to notice, participation, and inquiry conduct—remain in effect in their current form, as they were preserved in the amended version.

### **Key Definitions**

The regulation introduces the following key terms:

| **Act** | Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (TLC Act) |
| **Application** | A formal request submitted under sections 24, 31, or 233 of the Act for incorporation, continuance, or amalgamation |
| **Inquiry** | A public hearing held under subsections 25(3), 32(1), or 233(3) of the Act to examine an objection |

### **Scope of Application**

- Subsection **25(3)** – Objections to proposed incorporations  
- Subsection **32(1)** – Objections to proposed continuances

### **Appointment of Presiding Officer**

- The Superintendent has the authority to **appoint a person** (other than themselves) to preside over an inquiry, as provided under **section 7** of the Act.

### **Order of Submissions During the Inquiry**

- The **objector** must make their submissions **first**

This structure ensures that the objection is fully heard before the applicant has the opportunity to rebut, promoting fairness and due process.

---

### **Openness of the Inquiry**

- Every inquiry must be **open to the public**

**Location of Access:**  
- The **Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Ottawa**  
- Or, during the inquiry, at the **location where the inquiry is held**  

This allows interested parties—including the public, media, and other stakeholders—to review the basis of the objection and the evidence presented.

---

### **Transmission of the Inquiry Report**

- After the Minister makes the findings of the inquiry **available to the public** under subsection **25(4)** of the Act, the Superintendent must:

- The regulation was **partially repealed** by **SOR/98-535, s. 2**, specifically affecting:
  - The definition of "address for service" (repealed in SOR/98-535, s. 4)
- However, the **core procedural framework**—including notice, inquiry structure, public access, and submission rules—**remains in force** and continues to govern public inquiries under the TLC Act.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **clear, structured, and transparent process** for public inquiries into objections to proposed financial institution activities. It balances the need for regulatory oversight with the rights of applicants and objectors to be heard, ensures public access to information, and maintains accountability in decisions affecting the financial sector.
