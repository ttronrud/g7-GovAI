**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title of Regulation:**

**Date of Issuance:**

**Place of Issuance:** Ottawa, Canada

### **1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, which is enacted as *S.C. 2002, c. 29*. SARA is a federal law designed to prevent species from becoming extinct and to promote their recovery by identifying and protecting critical habitat and implementing recovery strategies.

The regulation specifically designates **critical habitat** for the **Vananda Creek Benthic Threespine Stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)**, a distinct population segment of the threespine stickleback fish. This population is recognized as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Regulation**

#### **a. Designation of Critical Habitat**
- The Order formally designates specific areas as **critical habitat** for the Vananda Creek Benthic Threespine Stickleback.
- This designation is based on the **recovery strategy** for the species, which has been officially included in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**—a government database that publicly documents recovery plans and critical habitat for at-risk species.
- The critical habitat identified in this Order is **not located in any area referred to in subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA.  
  > *Note: Subsection 58(2)(b) of SARA refers to areas that are subject to certain land claims agreements and may be under the jurisdiction of Indigenous wildlife management boards.*

This exclusion is significant because it means the designated critical habitat does **not fall within lands governed by Indigenous land claims agreements** where wildlife management boards have specific authority.

#### **b. Consultation with Indigenous Wildlife Management Boards**
- The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFOD) has determined that the proposed critical habitat designation **affects an area where a wildlife management board is authorized by a land claims agreement** to perform wildlife-related functions.
- In accordance with **subsection 58(8)** of SARA, the Minister conducted **formal consultation** with the relevant wildlife management board prior to issuing the Order.
- This consultation ensures that Indigenous communities and their governance bodies have a voice in decisions affecting species at risk on their traditional lands, respecting their rights and responsibilities under land claims agreements.

#### **c. Legal Authority**
- The Order is made pursuant to **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of SARA.
  - **Subsection 58(4)** grants the Minister the authority to designate critical habitat for a listed species.
  - **Subsection 58(5)** requires that the designation be based on scientific evidence and recovery strategies.
- **Subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to this critical habitat designation, meaning that the area is legally protected under the Act and must be managed to avoid adverse effects on the species’ survival and recovery.

### **3. Purpose and Significance**

- The primary purpose of this Order is to **protect and conserve the specific environmental conditions necessary for the survival and recovery** of the Vananda Creek Benthic Threespine Stickleback.
- By formally identifying and legally protecting critical habitat, the government ensures that:
  - Development, land use, or other activities that could degrade or destroy this habitat are subject to review and mitigation.
  - The species has a secure environment for breeding, feeding, and growth.
- This action supports the broader goals of SARA, including the **prevention of extinction**, **recovery of at-risk species**, and **integration of Indigenous governance** into conservation planning.

---

### **4. Enforcement and Effectiveness**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Government of Canada (i.e., after official publication in the Canada Gazette).
- Once in force, the critical habitat is legally protected under SARA. Any activity that would result in a significant adverse effect on the habitat must be assessed and approved under the **provincial or federal environmental assessment processes**, depending on jurisdiction.
- The designation may be reviewed or amended in the future if new scientific information becomes available or if recovery outcomes change.

### **5. Key Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Species Protection:** The Vananda Creek Benthic Threespine Stickleback is a distinct population that has evolved in isolation, making it particularly vulnerable. Protecting its habitat is essential to its long-term survival.
- **Indigenous Engagement:** The consultation process reflects Canada’s commitment to **Indigenous partnership and co-management**, especially in areas governed by land claims agreements.
- **Legal Clarity:** By confirming that the critical habitat is not within a land claims area, the Order avoids potential conflicts with Indigenous land rights and ensures that Indigenous authorities are not inadvertently excluded from the protection process.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a formal, legally binding step in the conservation of a rare and endangered fish species. It establishes the **critical habitat** for the Vananda Creek Benthic Threespine Stickleback under the Species at Risk Act, based on scientific recovery planning and in full compliance with Indigenous consultation requirements. The Order strengthens legal protections for the species, promotes biodiversity, and demonstrates a balanced approach to environmental protection and Indigenous governance.

It serves as a model for how federal species protection laws can be implemented with scientific rigor, legal precision, and respect for Indigenous rights.
