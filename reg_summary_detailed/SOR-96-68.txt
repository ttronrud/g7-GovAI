**Detailed Summary of the Prescribed Persons and Organizations Regulations**

**Regulatory Context and Authority**  
The *Prescribed Persons and Organizations Regulations* are a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act* (S.C. 1995, c. 18). Specifically, these regulations were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Veterans Affairs, pursuant to **paragraph 45(e)** of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act. This provision empowers the government to designate certain individuals and organizations as "prescribed" for specific purposes within the Act—primarily to ensure that appeals and reviews involving veterans’ benefits and entitlements are conducted with appropriate representation and oversight.

**Regulation Title**  
These regulations are officially titled the *Prescribed Persons and Organizations Regulations* and may be cited as such.

**Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to formally identify and list specific persons and organizations that are recognized under **sections 30 and 37** of the *Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act*. These sections govern the eligibility of individuals and entities to participate in or represent veterans in appeals processes related to pensions, benefits, and other entitlements administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

By designating these entities as "prescribed," the regulations establish their formal standing in the appeal process. This includes rights to participate in hearings, submit evidence, or represent veterans before the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (VRAB), ensuring that the process is inclusive, equitable, and grounded in recognized veteran advocacy and administrative structures.

**List of Prescribed Persons and Organizations**
