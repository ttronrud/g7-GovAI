Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers and Control from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
- The regulation is issued under the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.
- Specifically, it is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)** of that Act, which permits the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer control and supervision of certain public service functions between departments.
- This transfer is not a standalone legislative act but a consequential administrative reorganization based on prior Orders in Council.

---

#### **2. Key Transfer: Control and Supervision of CBSA Functions**
- **What is transferred**:  
  The **control and supervision** of specific portions of the public service within the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** that are responsible for **pre-removal risk assessments**.
  
- **Scope of the function**:  
  Pre-removal risk assessments are assessments conducted by immigration authorities to determine whether a person who is subject to removal from Canada poses a risk of harm to public safety, national security, or the integrity of the immigration system. These assessments are critical in determining whether an individual should be removed from Canada or whether they should be subject to conditions prior to removal.

- **Historical basis**:  
  The transfer is based on **Order in Council P.C. 2003-2063**, dated December 12, 2003. This earlier Order in Council originally transferred certain CBSA responsibilities to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration (DCI), and this regulation formalizes the **ongoing control and supervision** of those functions.

- **Effective result**:  
  The **Department of Citizenship and Immigration (DCI)** now has **direct authority over the management, oversight, and operational control** of the CBSA units conducting pre-removal risk assessments. This includes staffing, budgeting, policy implementation, and administrative supervision of these units.

#### **3. Key Transfer: Powers, Duties, and Functions under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)**
- **What is transferred**:  
  The **powers, duties, and functions** specified in **subsection 77(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)**, which relate to pre-removal risk assessments and associated decisions.

- **Specific provisions under IRPA, subsection 77(1)**:  
  This subsection empowers the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to:
  - Conduct pre-removal risk assessments;
  - Make decisions on whether to proceed with removal or impose conditions;
  - Consider factors such as public safety, national security, and the risk of reoffending;
  - Coordinate with other agencies (e.g., CBSA, RCMP, or other security bodies) as necessary.

- **Transfer mechanism**:  
  These powers and functions were previously held by the **Solicitor General of Canada**, who also held the title of **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** at the time of the transfer.

- **Result of the transfer**:  
  These responsibilities are now transferred to the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**, effectively integrating pre-removal risk assessment authority into the immigration department’s core mandate.

---

#### **4. Significance and Implications**
- **Functional Integration**:  
  This transfer ensures that the **decision-making authority** for pre-removal risk assessments is aligned with the **primary responsibility for immigration enforcement and policy** under the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. This enhances coherence and consistency in immigration decisions.

- **Improved Accountability and Oversight**:  
  By placing control and decision-making within the DCI, the government strengthens accountability, as these decisions are now subject to the oversight of immigration policy and legal frameworks rather than being managed under public safety or border security mandates.

- **Policy Continuity**:  
  The transfer maintains continuity with the 2003 Order in Council (P.C. 2003-2063), which established the initial framework for the division of responsibilities between CBSA and immigration departments. This regulation finalizes and operationalizes that arrangement.

- **Administrative Efficiency**:  
  It streamlines the administrative process by eliminating duplication or overlap in decision-making, particularly in high-stakes removal cases involving national security or public safety risks.

#### **5. Regulatory Citation and Reference**
- **Regulation reference**:  
  SI/2003-215 (Statutory Instrument 2003-215)
- **Prior Order in Council**:  
  P.C. 2003-2063 (December 12, 2003)

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally transfers key responsibilities related to **pre-removal risk assessments** from the Canada Border Services Agency (via public service control) and from the Solicitor General (via statutory powers) to the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**. It consolidates decision-making authority under immigration policy and ensures that risk assessment functions are integrated into the broader immigration enforcement framework. The transfer is grounded in existing legislative and administrative orders and reflects a strategic reorganization to improve efficiency, accountability, and policy coherence in the management of immigration and removal processes.
