**Detailed Summary of the MicroSD Cards Exclusion Regulations (Copyright Act)**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The MicroSD Cards Exclusion Regulations are made under the authority of the *Copyright Act* (R.S., c. C-42) by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry. This action is authorized under two specific sections of the Copyright Act:

- **Section 79a**: Provides for the exclusion of certain types of digital storage media from the definition of "audio recording medium" in specific circumstances.
- **Section 87b**: Grants the Minister of Industry the power to make regulations to exclude certain technological formats from the scope of copyright protection, particularly in relation to digital recordings.

These provisions enable the government to tailor copyright protections to reflect technological developments and to avoid overbroad application of copyright rules to certain forms of digital storage.

**Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary objective of the MicroSD Cards Exclusion Regulations is to **exclude memory cards in the microSD form factor** from being classified as an "audio recording medium" under Section 79 of the *Copyright Act*. This exclusion is significant because, under the Act, certain forms of digital media are subject to specific copyright protections, particularly regarding the reproduction or distribution of audio recordings.

By excluding microSD cards—specifically microSD, microSDHC (High Capacity), and microSDXC (Extended Capacity)—from the definition of "audio recording medium," the regulation ensures that these storage devices are not treated as the medium through which audio recordings are made or distributed in a way that would trigger specific copyright obligations or restrictions.

**Scope of the Exclusion**  
The regulation explicitly covers the following types of memory cards:

- **microSD cards**  
- **microSDHC cards** (microSD High Capacity, with capacities up to 32 GB)  
- **microSDXC cards** (microSD Extended Capacity, with capacities exceeding 32 GB up to 2 TB)

These are defined by their physical form factor and technical specifications, and the exclusion applies to all such cards, regardless of their content or use.

**Legal Effect**  
Under Section 79 of the *Copyright Act*, an "audio recording medium" typically includes any device or format used to record or store audio content, such as magnetic tapes, digital audio files, or certain types of storage media. By excluding microSD cards from this definition, the regulation prevents the automatic application of copyright restrictions that would otherwise apply to the storage or transfer of audio content on these devices.

For example:
- A user recording a song onto a microSD card is not subject to the same copyright obligations as if the recording were made on a traditional audio tape or digital audio workstation.
- The regulation does not affect the copyright of the *audio content itself*, only the *medium* in which it is stored.
- The exclusion does not extend to other forms of media (e.g., DVDs, CDs, or cloud storage) or to other forms of digital recording.

**Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on the day on which they are officially registered in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (the official journal of federal legislation). This ensures that the exclusion is legally effective and enforceable from that date forward.

**Context and Rationale**  
This regulation reflects a broader effort by the Canadian government to modernize copyright law in response to rapid technological change. As digital storage technologies have evolved, the traditional definitions of "recording media" have become outdated or overly restrictive. The exclusion of microSD cards recognizes that:

- These cards are primarily data storage devices, not tools for audio recording per se.
- The content stored on them (e.g., music, voice recordings) is protected under copyright law, but the medium itself does not fall under the definition of an "audio recording medium" as defined in Section 79.

This helps prevent unnecessary legal barriers for consumers, businesses, and developers using microSD cards in portable devices (e.g., smartphones, cameras, tablets), where such storage is common and often used for recording and transferring audio content.

**Limitations and Implications**  
- The exclusion applies only to the *form factor* and *type* of card, not to the content stored on it.
- Copyright protection for audio recordings remains intact regardless of the storage medium.
- The regulation does not affect other areas of copyright law (e.g., reproduction, distribution, or public performance rights).

**Conclusion**  
The MicroSD Cards Exclusion Regulations represent a targeted and technologically relevant update to Canadian copyright law. By removing microSD, microSDHC, and microSDXC cards from the definition of "audio recording medium," the regulation ensures that these widely used digital storage devices are not subject to overly broad or outdated copyright restrictions. This supports innovation, consumer flexibility, and the practical use of modern technology in personal and commercial contexts, while maintaining the core protections of copyright for original audio works.
