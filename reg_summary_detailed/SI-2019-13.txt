**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (27(1.2)) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**. These subsections empower the Minister to refer the status assessment of a species to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** when new information becomes available that significantly affects the species’ status.

**Key Provisions of the Regulation**

**(a) Referral of the Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) Atlantic Population Assessment to COSEWIC**  
The Government has formally referred the status assessment of the **Shortfin Mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) Atlantic population** back to **COSEWIC** for further evaluation. This action is taken because new scientific information—specifically, data and analysis from the **International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)**—has emerged since the initial COSEWIC assessment and indicates a significantly more negative outlook for the species’ status in Canadian waters.

- The initial COSEWIC assessment, conducted in **April 2017**, classified the Shortfin Mako Atlantic population as a **"Species of Special Concern"** under SARA.
- However, a **recent ICCAT assessment (completed in autumn 2017)** provided updated data suggesting that the population is under greater threat than previously recognized.
- This new information was not available at the time of the original COSEWIC evaluation, meaning it constitutes a material change in the scientific understanding of the species’ condition.

As a result, COSEWIC has determined that a **reassessment is necessary** to properly evaluate the current status of the Shortfin Mako in Canada. The referral ensures that the most up-to-date and comprehensive scientific evidence is considered before any formal designation or protective measures are implemented.

**(b) Public Registry Approval**  
The Minister of the Environment is authorized to include in the **public registry established under Section 120 of SARA** a **statement attached as an annex** to this regulation. This statement outlines the **reasons for the referral back to COSEWIC**, including the nature of the new ICCAT findings and their implications for the species’ status.

- The public registry is a transparent mechanism under SARA that ensures the public can access information about species assessments, decisions, and scientific justifications related to endangered species.
- By including this statement, the Government ensures public accountability and transparency in the decision-making process.

**Scientific Context and Biological Background**

- The **Shortfin Mako** is a fast-swimming, apex predator shark known for its high speed and efficiency in hunting.
- It is classified as a **low-productivity species**, meaning it has a **long reproductive cycle** and produces few offspring per year.
- The estimated **generation time** is approximately **25 years**, which makes the species particularly vulnerable to population declines due to overfishing or environmental changes.
- Due to this slow reproductive rate, populations can take decades to recover from declines, making them highly sensitive to fishing pressure and other threats.

**Rationale for Reassessment**  
The referral is not a change in the species’ designation per se, but a procedural step to ensure scientific rigor and accuracy. The new ICCAT data likely includes updated population estimates, catch trends, bycatch data, or mortality rates that suggest:

- A more significant decline in the Atlantic population than previously estimated.
- Increased fishing pressure or unregulated harvesting.
- A higher risk of overexploitation.

These findings necessitate a **revised and updated scientific evaluation** by COSEWIC, which is the independent body responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species in Canada.

**Implications and Next Steps**

1. **COSEWIC will conduct a new assessment** incorporating the ICCAT data and any other relevant scientific inputs.
2. The updated assessment will inform future decisions under SARA, including whether the species may be reclassified (e.g., to "Endangered" or "Threatened") or if additional conservation measures are warranted.
3. The public registry will remain updated with the rationale for the referral, allowing stakeholders, researchers, and the public to track the process.
4. The Government will continue to monitor the species and may take further action—such as implementing fishing restrictions or conservation measures—once the new assessment is complete.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation reflects a commitment to **scientific integrity and adaptive management** in species conservation. By referring the Shortfin Mako assessment back to COSEWIC in light of new, compelling evidence, the Government ensures that conservation decisions are based on the most current and accurate scientific data. This step underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and the dynamic nature of species status evaluations under the *Species at Risk Act*. The final outcome of the reassessment will have significant implications for fisheries management, marine conservation, and the protection of Canada’s biodiversity.
