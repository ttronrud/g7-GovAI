**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Control and Supervision – Next Generation Human Resources and Pay System Initiative**

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), specifically under paragraph 2(a)(a) of that Act. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer control and supervision of certain functions or initiatives within the federal public service.

**Key Provision:**  
The Governor General in Council, by virtue of the above authority, transfers from **Shared Services Canada (SSC)** to the **Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS)** the control and supervision of the portion of the federal public administration within SSC known as the **Next Generation Human Resources and Pay System Initiative** (NGHRSI).

**Nature of the Transfer:**  
- The transfer involves **control and supervision**—not ownership or operational staff—of the NGHRSI.  
- This means that DPWGS will now be responsible for overseeing the strategic direction, governance, performance monitoring, and policy decisions related to the initiative.  
- Shared Services Canada will retain operational responsibilities for the day-to-day delivery of services, unless otherwise specified.

**Scope of the Initiative:**  
The *Next Generation Human Resources and Pay System Initiative* is a major federal digital transformation project designed to modernize and streamline the federal government’s human resources (HR) and payroll systems. Key components typically include:  
- A centralized, secure, and scalable HR information system.  
- Automated payroll processing and reporting.  
- Improved data accuracy, accessibility, and real-time reporting for HR and finance functions.  
- Enhanced employee service delivery through a unified digital platform.  

This initiative aims to reduce administrative burdens, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance with human resources and financial regulations across federal departments.

**Rationale for the Transfer:**  
The transfer reflects a strategic realignment of federal public service responsibilities to better align with organizational priorities and functional expertise.  
- The Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS) has a long-standing mandate and operational experience in managing public service infrastructure, human resources, and government services.  
- By placing the NGHRSI under DPWGS, the government ensures that the initiative benefits from strong oversight in areas such as service delivery, cost management, and integration with broader government operations.  
- It may also facilitate better coordination between HR and government operations, as DPWGS is responsible for both public works and government service delivery.

**Legal Citation:**  
- **Statutory Source:** S.C. 2003, c. 22, section 207 (Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act)  
- **Revised Statutes Reference:** R.S., c. P-34 (the current version of the Public Service Act, which includes the relevant provisions)

**Effective Date and Implementation:**  
While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such transfers are typically effective upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon formal notification to relevant departments. Implementation would involve coordination between Shared Services Canada, DPWGS, and relevant federal departments to ensure continuity of service and data integrity.

**Implications:**  
- **For Shared Services Canada:** The transfer reduces its direct oversight of a key HR/payroll initiative, potentially shifting focus to other shared services.  
- **For the Department of Public Works and Government Services:** Gains responsibility for a critical HR and payroll modernization project, reinforcing its role in enabling efficient and effective public service delivery.  
- **For Federal Departments:** May benefit from improved HR and payroll systems, leading to faster processing, reduced errors, and better workforce management.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. It transfers governance and oversight of the Next Generation Human Resources and Pay System Initiative from Shared Services Canada to the Department of Public Works and Government Services. The move is designed to enhance the effectiveness, accountability, and integration of HR and payroll systems across the federal government, leveraging the expertise of DPWGS in public service infrastructure and human resources management.
