The provided text consists of repeated references to the repeal and revocation of a regulation:

- "[Repealed, SOR/2006-126, s. 1]" appears three times.
- "[Revoked, SOR/90-737, s. 1]" appears once.

### Summary:

This text indicates that a specific regulation has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) and **revoked** (officially canceled or invalidated) through two separate statutory instruments:

1. **SOR/2006-126, section 1**: This regulation was formally repealed on or around the date of the publication of SOR/2006-126 (Statutory Instrument 2006-126), which was issued in 2006. The repeal is explicitly stated in section 1 of that instrument. The repetition of this notice suggests it was emphasized in the official record.

2. **SOR/90-737, section 1**: This regulation was revoked earlier, in 1990, under the authority of Statutory Instrument 1990-737, section 1. The term "revoked" implies that the regulation was formally canceled or replaced, typically due to being superseded by a newer law or policy.

### Interpretation:

- The regulation referenced is **no longer in force**.
- It was **removed from the legal framework** through two distinct legislative actions: first in 1990 (revoked by SOR/90-737), and then again in 2006 (repealed by SOR/2006-126).
- The dual references suggest that the regulation may have been in effect for a long period and was eventually phased out due to changes in policy, redundancy, or inconsistency with newer legislation.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active or currently applicable regulation** described in the provided text. The regulation has been **fully repealed and revoked**, meaning it no longer holds legal force in Canada. Any references to it in legal or administrative contexts are now considered obsolete.

> **Note**: Without the original text of the regulation, the exact subject matter (e.g., licensing, environmental standards, transportation rules) cannot be determined. However, the summary confirms its legal status: **repealed and revoked**.
