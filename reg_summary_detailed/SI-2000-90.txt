S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47  
**Applicable Legislation:**  
- *Financial Administration Act*, Section 157a

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation, issued under **Section 157a of the Financial Administration Act**, serves to **discontinue the requirement** for certain annual reports to be laid before either House of Parliament. The rationale provided is that the information contained in these specific reports is either:

1. **Already available** in the Public Accounts or  
2. **Less comprehensive** than the information contained in the Public Accounts or in official estimates of expenditures submitted to Parliament.

This means that the reports in question do not provide new or additional value to Parliament’s oversight function and are therefore redundant.

### **Documents Discontinued**

The following two reports are specifically discontinued under this regulation:

1. **Annual Report on the Canadian Centre for Management Development**  
   - **Governing Act:** *Canadian Centre for Management Development Act*, S.C. 1991, c. 16, s. 19(2)  
   - **Purpose of Original Requirement:** To provide Parliament with an annual account of the activities, financial performance, and outcomes of the Canadian Centre for Management Development (CCMD), a federal institution focused on leadership and management training.

2. **Annual Report on the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)**  
   - **Governing Act:** *Department of Fisheries and Oceans Act*, R.S. 1985, c. F-15, s. 6  
   - **Purpose of Original Requirement:** To present an annual review of the operations, performance, and financial status of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, a key federal department responsible for natural resource management.

### **Legal Basis for Discontinuation**

The decision to discontinue these reports is grounded in **Section 157a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board) to:

- **Discontinue the preparation or laying before Parliament** of any document that:
  - Is required by an Act of Parliament to be presented to Parliament, **and**
  - Contains information that is **already included** in the Public Accounts or in expenditure estimates submitted to Parliament.

This provision is intended to **reduce duplication**, **streamline parliamentary oversight**, and **enhance efficiency** in the reporting system by eliminating redundant or overlapping disclosures.

### **Key Implications**

1. **No Further Requirement to Prepare or Submit Reports**  
   - The Canadian Centre for Management Development and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans are no longer required to prepare and submit annual reports to either the House of Commons or the Senate.

2. **Information Already Available**  
   - The financial and operational details previously contained in these reports are now considered to be **already accessible** through:
     - The Public Accounts (which provide comprehensive financial summaries of government operations)
     - Official estimates of expenditures (which outline budget allocations and expected spending)

3. **Parliamentary Oversight Remains Intact**  
   - Although the specific annual reports are discontinued, Parliament retains its authority to scrutinize government operations and finances through other established mechanisms such as:
     - Budget reviews
     - Public Accounts debates
     - Committee inquiries
     - Annual reports of other departments or agencies (where applicable)

4. **Efficiency and Cost Savings**  
   - The discontinuation reduces administrative burden on government departments and avoids duplication of effort in reporting and review.

5. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - While the reports are discontinued, the underlying accountability of the agencies is maintained through other formal oversight mechanisms, including performance reporting, audits, and evaluations conducted by independent bodies.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation reflects a broader policy shift toward **streamlining government reporting** to Parliament. By determining that the information in the annual reports on the Canadian Centre for Management Development and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is redundant or already available in existing public financial documents, the government has taken a pragmatic step to eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements.

The decision underscores the principle that **parliamentary oversight should be focused on essential, non-redundant information** that adds value to the legislative process. It also demonstrates the role of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Finance in ensuring that government operations remain efficient and transparent without excessive administrative overhead.

**Note:** This regulation remains in force as part of the *Financial Administration Act* and is a key example of how statutory reporting requirements can be reviewed and modified based on efficiency and relevance.
