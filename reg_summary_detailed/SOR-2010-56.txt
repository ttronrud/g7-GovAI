### **Detailed Summary of the *Declarations Regulations (Chemical Weapons Convention)***

This regulation, made under **section 11a and 18 of the *Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act*** by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, establishes a comprehensive reporting and declaration framework for activities involving **toxic chemicals and precursors** listed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The primary objective is to ensure **transparency, accountability, and compliance** with international obligations under the CWC by requiring detailed disclosures from individuals and entities that handle or produce certain chemicals — particularly those with potential use in chemical weapons.

The regulation is structured into several key parts, each targeting different types of facilities and activities, and is designed to cover both **existing operations** and **future activities**. Below is a detailed breakdown of its provisions:

---

## **I. Definitions**

The regulation begins with a clear set of definitions that establish key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act* (CWCIA). |
| **CAS Registry Number** | A unique identification number assigned by the *Chemical Abstracts Service* (American Chemical Society) to a chemical substance. Used for precise identification when available. |
| **Contact Information** | Includes address, telephone number, fax number (if applicable), and email address. |
| **Discrete Organic Chemical** | Any carbon-based compound **excluding** carbon monoxide, CO₂, carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and metal carbonates. Excludes **oligomers, polymers**, and chemicals containing only carbon and metal. |
| **PSF Chemical** | A discrete organic chemical containing **phosphorus, sulfur, or fluorine** — a category of concern due to potential use in chemical warfare agents. |
| **Schedule 1 Chemical** | Toxic chemicals or precursors listed in **Schedule 1** of the CWC Annex on Chemicals. These are the most strictly regulated due to their direct link to chemical weapon production. |
| **Schedule 2 Chemical** | Toxic chemicals or precursors listed in **Schedule 2**. Less restricted than Schedule 1 but still subject to reporting thresholds. |
| **Schedule 3 Chemical** | Toxic chemicals or precursors listed in **Schedule 3** — generally less sensitive but still monitored. |
| **Single Small-Scale Facility** | A specific facility defined in the *Schedule 1 Chemicals Regulations* (CWCIA), intended to allow small-scale, legitimate uses (e.g., medical or protective purposes) of Schedule 1 chemicals. |
| **Other Facility** | Any plant or site **other than** the single small-scale facility where Schedule 1 chemical activities occur. |

> **Note**: Unless otherwise specified, all terms used in the regulations have the same meaning as in the CWC itself.

## **II. Electronic Submission**

- All notices and declarations may be submitted **electronically**, providing flexibility and efficiency in reporting.

---

## **III. Scope of Application**

- This regulation applies to **any activity authorized under the Schedule 1 Chemicals Regulations (CWCIA)**.
- It applies to both **existing operations** and **planned future activities** at:
  - The **single small-scale facility**
  - **Other facilities** (i.e., larger or different types of sites)

---

## **IV. Initial Declarations (Mandatory Within 90 Days of Coming Into Force)**

Any person operating at the **single small-scale facility** or an **other facility** under an authorization under subsection **8(1)** of the Act must submit an **initial declaration** within **90 days** of the regulation’s coming into force.

### **Required Information in Initial Declaration:**

| Item | Details |
|------|--------|
| **Name & Contact Info** | Full name and contact details (address, phone, email) of the declarant |
| **Authorized Representative** | Name, position, and contact info (if applicable, for corporations) |
| **Facility Details** | Name and address; if no address, a precise location description |
| **Technical Description** | Detailed description including equipment inventory and diagrams |

> This ensures that the National Authority has a full understanding of the physical setup and capabilities of the facility.

---

## **V. Notification of Changes to Information**

Declarants must notify the National Authority in writing of any changes to declared information:

| Change Type | Notification Deadline |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Name, contact info, facility address/location** | Within **7 days** of change |
| **Technical description (equipment, diagrams)** or **purpose of operation** | At least **200 days before** the change occurs |

> This allows sufficient time for planning and regulatory review while maintaining timely updates.

---

## **VI. Annual Declarations (By Calendar Year)**

### **1. Annual Declaration of Actual Activities (Due by February 28 of the Following Year)**

Any person conducting activities at a single small-scale or other facility must submit an **annual declaration** detailing the year’s activities.

#### Required Information:
- Declarant and representative details
- Facility name and location
- For each **Schedule 1 chemical**:
  - IUPAC name and CAS number (or structural formula if no CAS)
  - Quantity **produced** (and production methods if for protective purposes)
  - Quantity **consumed** and **purpose of consumption**
  - Quantity **received or shipped** (with origin/destination, purpose)
  - **Maximum storage** at any time during the year
  - **Final storage quantity** at year-end
- For each **precursor** (from Schedules 1, 2, or 3) used in Schedule 1 chemical production:
  - IUPAC name and CAS number (or structural formula)
  - Quantity consumed
- Any **changes** to the facility’s technical description
- If activities cease, the **date of cessation**

> This provides a comprehensive audit trail of chemical flows and usage.

---

### **2. Anticipated Annual Declaration (Due by September 15 of the Current Year)**

Any person **anticipating** activities in the coming calendar year must submit an **advance declaration**.

#### Required Information:
- Declarant and representative details
- Facility name and location
- For each Schedule 1 chemical:
  - IUPAC name and CAS number (or structural formula)
  - **Anticipated quantity produced** and **purpose**
  - For other facilities: **Quarterly production timeline** (e.g., Q1, Q2)
- Anticipated changes to facility operations or technical setup

> This allows the National Authority to anticipate and assess risks before activities begin.

---

## **VII. Export/Import Notifications and Declarations**

### **1. Pre-Export/Import Notification (Minimum 45 Days Before)**

Any person planning to **export or import** a Schedule 1 chemical under authorization in subsection **8(2)** of the Act must:
