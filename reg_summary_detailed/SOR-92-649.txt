### **Detailed Summary of the Charlottetown Airport Zoning Regulations (1991)**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Enactment Context**

These regulations are issued under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed zoning regulations be publicly published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in local newspapers (including community and linguistic publications) to ensure transparency and provide a reasonable opportunity for public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Acting Minister of Transport) to adopt and promulgate the final zoning regulations after public consultation.

The proposed regulations were published in two successive issues of:
- *Canada Gazette, Part I* (March 16 and 23, 1991),
- *Charlottetown Guardian* and *The Evening Patriot* (April 25 and 26, 1991),
- *La Voix Acadienne* (May 1 and 8, 1991).

This ensured **public notice and opportunity for stakeholders** (e.g., landowners, aviation authorities, environmental groups) to submit representations or objections before the final regulations were enacted.

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Official Title**: *Charlottetown Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Applicability**: Applies to all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of **Charlottetown Airport**, located in the **County of Queens, Province of Prince Edward Island**.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical geographic and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Charlottetown Airport in the County of Queens, PEI. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used to establish elevation and spatial measurements. Located 1,200 m north along the centerline of runway 03, then 300 m eastward at right angles. Coordinates: N 293,283.042 m, E 690,665.396 m. Elevation: **47.2 meters above sea level**. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area (runway and approach zones) for each runway direction. Each strip is 300 m wide (150 m on each side of the centerline) and 2,253.6 m long. Two strips exist: **03–21** and **10–28**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a strip. It rises at a **1:50 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 50 meters horizontal distance) to a horizontal line 15,000 m from the end of the strip. The top of this line is **300 meters above the elevation at the strip end**, and extends 2,400 m from the centerline. This ensures safe aircraft approach paths. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. Ensures a smooth transition between runway zones and the outer airspace. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP** (i.e., 47.2 m + 45 m = 92.2 m above sea level). However, **if this elevation is less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground**. This prevents excessive height restrictions in low-lying areas. |

#### **4. Regulatory Provisions**

##### **(a) Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**

- **No construction or modification** is permitted on any land covered by these regulations if the **highest point** of any building, structure, or object exceeds:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

- This applies to:
  - New construction,
  - Expansion or addition to existing structures,
  - Any permanent object (e.g., towers, antennas, fences, trees).

##### **(b) Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds the height of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier to **remove the excessive growth**.

- This provision is designed to prevent obstructions to aircraft approaches and ensure unimpeded visibility and flight paths.

##### **(c) Prohibition of Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**

- No owner or occupier may use any land covered by the regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** to birds, or
  - **Attractive** to birds.

- This is a critical measure to **prevent bird strikes**, which pose a serious safety risk to aircraft operations.

#### **5. Spatial Boundaries and Reference Plan**

The regulations are tied to specific **zoning plans** approved on **February 12, 1988**, under the following plan numbers:

- **S-1857-0 to S-1857-12** (approach surfaces)
- **S-1857-3 to S-1857-6** (strips)
- **S-1857-0, S-1857-2 to S-1857-6, S-1857-8, S-1857-9, S-1857-11** (outer surface)

These plans define the exact spatial geometry of the airport zone and are referenced throughout the regulation.

##### **Boundary of the Outer Limits**

- The **outer boundary** is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This creates a buffer zone around the airport, within which height restrictions apply.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **Aircraft Safety**:
   - Ensure clear flight paths during takeoff and landing by preventing obstructions (buildings, trees, waste).
   - Maintain visibility and flight safety through controlled elevation limits.

2. **Environmental Protection**:
   - Prevent bird-related hazards by banning the disposal of food or attractive waste.

3. **Consistency with Aviation Standards**:
   - Align with international aviation safety standards for airport zoning, particularly regarding approach and transition zones.

4. **Public and Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - The public notice process ensures transparency and accountability in the regulatory process.

#### **7. Key Technical and Geometric Features**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Runway Strip (03–21 & 10–28)** | 300 m wide, 2,253.6 m long; 150 m on each side of centerline |
| **Approach Surface** | 1:50 slope; rises to 300 m above strip end elevation at 15,000 m distance; 2,400 m from centerline |
| **Transitional Surface** | 1:7 slope; extends from strip edges to outer surface |
| **Outer Surface** | 45 m above ARP (92.2 m above sea level); capped at 9 m above ground in low areas |
| **Reference Point (ARP)** | 47.2 m above sea level; at N 293,283.042 m, E 690,665.396 m |

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** is responsible for:
  - Enforcing compliance with height limits,
  - Issuing orders to remove excessive vegetation,
  - Monitoring and regulating waste disposal practices.

- Any violation may result in penalties or enforcement actions, though specific penalties are not detailed in this regulation.

### **Conclusion**

The **Charlottetown Airport Zoning Regulations (1991)** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use around Charlottetown Airport. By defining clear elevation limits (approach, transitional, outer surfaces), setting spatial boundaries (4,000 m radius), and prohibiting bird-attractive waste, the regulations prioritize **aviation safety**, **environmental protection**, and **public accountability**. The integration of precise geographic coordinates and reference points ensures that the zones are both scientifically accurate and legally enforceable.

These regulations remain a foundational element of airport safety planning in Prince Edward Island and reflect best practices in civil aviation zoning policy.
