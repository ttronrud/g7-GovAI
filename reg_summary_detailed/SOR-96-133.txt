### **Detailed Summary of the Fort Frances Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are formally established under the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Section 5.4** (which authorizes the Governor in Council to make zoning regulations) and **Section 5.5** (which requires public notice and opportunity for comment before adoption).

- A proposed version of these regulations was published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I** on **September 30 and October 7, 1995**, and in **two successive issues of the Fort Frances Times** on **November 8 and 15, 1995**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, residents, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on that public consultation, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, officially adopted the regulations on **October 1995**.

> **Legal Citation**:  
> *S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10* (General authority for airport zoning under the Aeronautics Act)  
> *R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1* (Reference to the notice and comment process)

#### **2. Regulation Title and Scope**

- **Title**: *Fort Frances Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: Applies to **all land** — including public road allowances — that is **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Fort Frances Airport**.
- The land is **specifically defined** in **Part VI of the Schedule**, which provides a detailed legal description (in survey terms) of the boundary.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Fort Frances Airport located in the Township of Miscampbell, District of Rainy River, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurement. Coordinates: **E 467,542.09; N 5,388,888.00** (UTM). |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runways (strips), designed to ensure unobstructed aircraft approach paths. Each has a specific slope and horizontal extent. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, but **not less than 9 meters above ground level** where terrain is low. |
| **Strip** | The designated area (runway plus approach zones) for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Includes runways 12–30 and 03–21. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the edges of the strips and approach surfaces, extending upward to intersect with the outer surface or adjacent transitional surfaces. |

---

#### **4. Elevation Reference**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **340.9 meters above sea level**.
- All other surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) are measured **relative to this point**.

---

#### **5. Core Prohibitions and Restrictions**

##### **(a) Height Restrictions on Structures and Objects**
- **No person** may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including additions) such that the **highest point** of the object exceeds:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

> This ensures that aircraft can safely approach, land, and take off without obstruction from buildings or other man-made structures.

##### **(b) Prohibition on Interference with Aviation Services**
- No owner or lessee may allow any use or development on regulated land that:
  - Interferes with **aircraft signals or communications** (e.g., radar, radio, navigation systems), or
  - Disrupts **aeronautical facilities** (e.g., control towers, lighting, ground services).

> This protects the integrity and safety of airport operations.

##### **(c) Management of Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows beyond the height of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require removal** of the excess growth.
- This provision ensures that even natural elements do not create hazards during flight operations.

#### **6. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

##### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located at:
  - Start: Threshold of runway 30 (southeastern end of runway 12–30)
    - UTM: E 468,118.65; N 5,388,517.56
  - Move **northwesterly** 684.45 meters along the runway centerline.
  - Then move **southwesterly 40 meters**, perpendicular to the runway centerline.
- Final coordinates: **E 467,542.09; N 5,388,888.00**

> This point serves as the **origin for all elevation and spatial measurements**.

---

##### **B. Approach Surfaces (by runway)**

| Runway | Slope | Horizontal Distance | Height at End | Outer Edge Distance |
|-------|------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **12** | 1:40 (1m vertical per 40m horizontal) | 1,740 m | 43.5 m above end | 336 m from centerline |
| **30** | 1:40 | 1,800 m | 45 m above end | 345 m from centerline |
| **03** | 1:20 | 890 m | 44.5 m above end | 119 m from centerline |
| **21** | 1:20 | 858 m | 42.9 m above end | 115.8 m from centerline |

> These surfaces define safe zones where no object should exceed height limits during aircraft approach.

---

##### **C. Outer Surface**

- A flat, imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP**.
- **Exception**: If the ground is lower than 45 meters above ARP, the outer surface is **set at 9 meters above ground level** to avoid impractical or unsafe height limits.

> This defines the outer boundary of the airport's "no-structure" zone.

---

##### **D. Strips (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|------|--------|
| **12–30** | 150 meters (75 m on each side of centerline) | 1,488.9 meters |
| **03–21** | 60 meters (30 m on each side) | 860.05 meters |

> These are the actual landing and takeoff zones, with defined spatial dimensions.

---

##### **E. Transitional Surfaces**

| Runway | Slope | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **12–30** | 1:7 (1m vertical per 7m horizontal) | Rises from lateral edges of strip and approach surfaces to meet outer surface or adjacent transitional surface |
| **03–21** | 1:5 (1m vertical per 5m horizontal) | Same, but steeper slope |

> These surfaces connect the approach zones to the outer boundary and prevent obstructions from extending beyond the airport’s operational envelope.

---

#### **7. Boundary of Regulated Land (Outer Boundary)**

The entire area subject to these zoning regulations is defined by a **complex, precise legal description** in survey terms, referencing specific lots, boundaries, and a **circle of 4,000 meters radius centered on the ARP**.

Key features:
- Covers parts of:
  - **Township of Miscampbell**
  - **Township of McIrvine**
  - **Township of Crozier**
  - **Couchiching Indian Reserve No. 16A**
- Begins at the **southwest corner of Lot 4, Concession 2, Miscampbell**
- Follows a **circular arc (4,000 m radius)** from the ARP to define the outer edge
- Continues along **road allowances**, **subdivision boundaries**, and **section lines** across multiple land parcels
- Ends back at the **starting point**, forming a closed boundary

> This ensures that the regulation applies only to land within a defined, safe perimeter around the airport.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excess vegetation
  - Enforce height restrictions
  - Prohibit development that interferes with aviation operations

> These powers are critical for maintaining **aviation safety**, **operational efficiency**, and **regulatory compliance**.

---

#### **9. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure Flight Safety**: Prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Maintain Operational Efficiency**: Provide clear, unobstructed airspace and
