**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Pullet Marketing Administration Levies Order (1980)**

---

**1. Regulatory Context and Authority**  
This regulation, titled *The Manitoba Pullet Marketing Administration Levies Order*, was issued on **July 3, 1980**, by the **Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** under **Section 4 of the Manitoba Pullet Order**. It operates within the broader framework of the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* (Loi), which provides the legal basis for establishing marketing boards and levies on agricultural commodities.

The Order is formally cited as:  
**Manitoba Pullet Marketing Administration Levies Order, 1980**.

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* (Loi), which empowers the government to regulate the marketing of certain agricultural products, including poultry.  
- **Commodity Board**: The *Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Act. This body is responsible for overseeing the marketing, pricing, and financial administration of egg-related products, including pullets.  
- **Pullet**: Defined as a **female domestic chicken (Gallus Domesticus)** that is **less than 20 weeks of age** and raised specifically for the purpose of laying eggs for human consumption. This distinguishes pullets from mature hens.  
- **Producer**: Any individual or entity that **raises or keeps pullets** within the Province of Manitoba.

---

**3. Levy Structure and Obligations**  

- **Levy Amount**: Every producer is required to pay a **levy of one cent (CAD) per pullet** marketed.  
  - This levy applies specifically to pullets sold in **interprovincial trade** and **export trade**.  
  - It does **not apply** to pullets sold within Manitoba (intrastate sales), as the scope is limited to trade outside the province or to international markets.

---

**4. Payment and Reporting Requirements**  

- **Timeliness of Payment**:  
  Producers must pay all levies due for pullets marketed during a given week **not later than seven days after the end of that week**.  
  - For example, if pullets are marketed during the week ending July 5, 1980, the levy must be paid by July 12, 1980.

- **Reporting Obligations**:  
  Along with the payment, each producer must submit a **detailed report** that includes:  
  - The **names of the purchasers and recipients** of the pullets;  
  - The **number of pullets received by each purchaser or recipient**.  

  This reporting requirement ensures transparency in the flow of pullets from producers to buyers and supports market monitoring and compliance.

**5. Revocation of Prior Plan**  
The Order explicitly references a prior **"Plan"** that was previously in effect. However, this plan has been **revoked** by **SOR/90-77, section 1** (Statutory Order 1990, No. 77). This indicates that the 1980 Order supersedes earlier administrative arrangements and establishes a new, current levy framework.

---

**6. Purpose and Objectives**  
The primary objectives of this Order are:  
- To generate **revenue** to support the marketing, promotion, and stabilization of the pullet and egg market in Manitoba.  
- To ensure **fair and equitable cost-sharing** among producers who participate in interprovincial and export markets.  
- To provide the Commodity Board with **data on market activity**, which aids in forecasting, pricing, and policy development.  
- To maintain **market integrity** and ensure that producers contributing to the supply chain contribute financially to its administration.

---

**7. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
This Order exemplifies how provincial marketing boards use **levy mechanisms** to regulate and finance the marketing of agricultural products. It reflects a common model in Canadian agricultural policy where producers contribute to collective marketing efforts in exchange for market stability and access to broader trade channels.

---

**8. Key Limitations and Scope**  
- The levy applies **only to pullets** and not to mature hens or other poultry.  
- It applies **only to interprovincial and export sales**—not domestic (intra-provincial) sales.  
- The levy is **per pullet**, not per producer or per farm, emphasizing a unit-based cost recovery model.  
- The requirement for detailed reporting introduces administrative burdens but enhances accountability.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Manitoba Pullet Marketing Administration Levies Order* of 1980 establishes a clear, enforceable financial mechanism for pullet producers participating in out-of-province and international markets. By imposing a one-cent levy per pullet and mandating timely payment and reporting, it ensures that the Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board can sustain its operations and maintain market stability. Although the original plan has been revoked, this Order remains a foundational regulatory instrument in the province’s poultry marketing framework, illustrating the intersection of agricultural policy, producer responsibility, and market oversight.

*Note: This Order is now potentially outdated due to the revocation of the prior "Plan" under SOR/90-77, and its current applicability should be verified against updated regulations or successor legislation.*
