**Detailed Summary of the Face Protectors for Ice Hockey and Box Lacrosse Players Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
The regulations are issued under the authority of the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act* (CCPSA), specifically pursuant to **Section 37** of the Act. This section empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Health) to establish safety standards for consumer products that pose a risk to health or safety. In this case, the regulation applies to face protectors used by ice hockey and box lacrosse players.

**Regulatory Text and Key Provisions:**

1. **Applicability:**
   - The regulations apply to **face protectors** designed for use by **ice hockey and box lacrosse players**.
   - These products are intended to protect the face, eyes, nose, and mouth from injury during gameplay.

2. **Compliance Requirement:**
   - All face protectors sold, distributed, or imported into Canada must **comply with the requirements of CAN3-Z262.2-M78**, a Canadian Standard.
   - The standard is titled: *Face Protectors for Ice Hockey and Box Lacrosse Players*.
   - It was published by the **Canadian Standards Association (CSA)**:
     - In **English** in **December 1978**
     - In **French** in **June 1979**
   - The standard sets out specific technical and performance criteria, such as:
     - Structural integrity (e.g., resistance to impact and deformation)
     - Material safety (e.g., non-toxic, non-allergenic materials)
     - Fit and design (e.g., proper coverage, ventilation, and retention systems)
     - Testing procedures (e.g., impact resistance, edge strength, and durability)

3. **Legal Effect:**
   - Compliance with CAN3-Z262.2-M78 is **mandatory** for all face protectors intended for use in ice hockey and box lacrosse.
   - The regulation establishes that failure to meet the standard constitutes a violation of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, potentially leading to product recalls, market bans, or enforcement actions by Health Canada.

4. **Repeal Clause:**
   - The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that any prior or conflicting regulations related to face protectors in these sports are hereby **repealed**. This ensures clarity and alignment with the current standard.

5. **Effective Date:**
   - The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This means they are immediately enforceable upon official publication and registration, without a specified delay.

**Purpose and Public Health/Safety Objective:**
The primary goal of these regulations is to **minimize the risk of facial injuries** during high-impact sports such as ice hockey and box lacrosse. By mandating compliance with a well-established and tested safety standard, the regulations ensure that players are protected from trauma caused by collisions, sticks, or other equipment.

**Significance:**
- This regulation reflects Canada’s commitment to consumer product safety in sports.
- It provides a consistent, nationally recognized standard that manufacturers, distributors, and retailers must follow.
- It supports injury prevention and promotes safer participation in youth and professional sports.

**Note on Standard Status:**
Although the standard was published in 1978 and 1979, its continued use in this regulation suggests it has been validated over time and remains relevant. However, it is important to note that the standard may be periodically reviewed or updated by the Canadian Standards Association to reflect advances in materials science, safety research, or sport-specific needs.

**Conclusion:**
The *Face Protectors for Ice Hockey and Box Lacrosse Players Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21) establish a mandatory safety requirement for face protectors used in these sports. By requiring compliance with CAN3-Z262.2-M78, the regulations ensure that such equipment meets rigorous performance and safety benchmarks. The regulations are effective upon registration and replace any previous requirements, reinforcing Canada’s regulatory framework for protecting athletes during high-risk physical activity.
