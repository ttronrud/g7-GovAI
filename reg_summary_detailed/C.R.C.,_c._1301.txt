**Detailed Summary of the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Regulations**

---

### **Overview**
The *Prairie Grain Advance Payments Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Regulations") are a set of rules governing the issuance of advance payments to grain producers in Prairie provinces (primarily Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba) under the *Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act* (the "Act"). These regulations establish the procedures, eligibility criteria, documentation requirements, payment rates, and administrative responsibilities related to advance payments for grain delivered to the Canadian Wheat Board (the "Board").

---

## **Key Definitions and Parties Involved**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act*, which provides the legal basis for advance payments.
- **Board**: The Canadian Wheat Board, the regulatory body responsible for administering the advance payment program.

---

## **Application Procedures for Advance Payments**

### **1. Eligibility and Application Forms**

- **Form AR-A (Standard Applicant)**:
  - Applies to producers who:
    - Have fully discharged all prior undertakings (obligations) related to previous advance payments.
    - Have not received an advance payment in the current crop year.
  - Application must be submitted in **Form AR-A**, completed in **ink or indelible pencil**.

- **Form AR-B (Non-Standard Applicant)**:
  - Applies to all other applicants (e.g., those with outstanding undertakings or unresolved obligations from prior years).
  - Requires verification of:
    - The amount of the first advance payment made.
    - Deliveries made under that payment.
    - The balance of grain remaining to be delivered.
  - The application is forwarded to the Board for verification before approval.

> *Note: The distinction ensures accountability and prevents overpayment or fraud by requiring verification for applicants with prior obligations.*

## **Submission and Approval Process**

### **Step 1: Submission**
- The producer must submit a completed application form to:
  - A **manager or operator of an elevator**, or
  - Another person **authorized by the Board** to make advance payments on its behalf.

### **Step 2: Review and Approval**
- The authorized person must **carefully examine** the application and verify that the statements are true.

#### **For Form AR-A (Discharged Undertakings)**:
- If verified, the person approves the application **on behalf of the Board**.

#### **For Form AR-B (Non-Discharged or Complex Cases)**:
- The application is **forwarded to the Board** for verification.
- Upon receiving Board confirmation, the authorized person **approves the application** on behalf of the Board.

---

## **Permit Book Requirements**

- At the time of application, the producer must **produce the permit book** described in the application.
- The permit book is a document that tracks the producer’s entitlements, deliveries, and outstanding obligations.

### **Endorsement Requirements**

- Upon approval:
  - The approving officer must:
    1. **Place an endorsement** in the permit book in accordance with **Form AR-C**.
    2. **Sign the endorsement**.
    3. **Write “endorsed”** on the outside front cover of the permit book, including the **date of endorsement**.
    4. **Sign the endorsement** again.

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and a clear record of each advance payment.

### **Amendment for Form AR-B**
- If the application is approved under Form AR-B, the endorsement is **amended** to include the new advance payment amount.

---

## **Advance Payment and Certification**

- Upon approval, the authorized person must:
  - **Make the advance payment** as requested.
  - **Sign a certificate of approval** in ink or indelible pencil, confirming that:
    1. The application was examined and found truthful.
    2. The named producers are correct and match those in the permit book.
    3. The permit book was produced and endorsed.
    4. The payment was approved and made on behalf of the Board.

> This certification serves as legal documentation of the transaction and protects both the Board and the producer.

---

## **Transfer of Endorsement (For Defaulting Recipients)**

- If a producer **fails to fulfill their undertaking** (i.e., fails to deliver the required grain) in a prior crop year:
  - The Board must place a **Transfer of Endorsement Form** (in accordance with **Form AR-C**) in the permit book.
  - The transfer allows the entitlement to be reassigned or transferred to another party (e.g., a new producer or a future buyer).
- After placement:
  - The officer must:
    - Write “endorsed” and the **date of transfer** on the front cover.
    - Sign the endorsement.

> This mechanism allows for the management of defaulted obligations and ensures the Board can maintain oversight of outstanding entitlements.

---

## **Cancellation of Endorsement (When Undertaking is Discharged)**

- When a producer **fully discharges their undertaking** (i.e., delivers all required grain):
  - The Board shall **cancel the endorsement** in the permit book.
  - The cancellation is recorded in **Form AR-E**.

> This closes the entitlement and prevents future advances or claims.

---

## **Quantities and Quota-Based Payments**

### **Maximum Quantity per Quota Acre**
- Advance payments are based on **quota acres** (a measure of land entitlement).
- The prescribed quantities are:
  - **Wheat**: 0.270 tonnes per quota acre  
  - **Oats**: 0.230 tonnes per quota acre  
  - **Barley**: 0.435 tonnes per quota acre  

> This ensures that payments are proportional to the land base and not arbitrary.

### **Adjustment for Delivery Shortfalls**
- The maximum quantity of grain deliverable under a permit book in a crop year is **reduced** by the difference between:
  - The quantity the producer was **authorized to deliver** under the same quotas (i.e., original quota);
  - The quantity they **actually delivered** under **general quotas that have terminated** before the application.

> This prevents over-delivery and ensures that producers are not entitled to more than their original quota if they have already delivered some grain under terminated quotas.

---

## **Prescribed Grades of Grain**

For the crop year beginning **August 1, 1986**, the following grades are prescribed:
- **Wheat**: No. 1 Canada Western Red Spring  
- **Oats**: No. 1 Feed  
- **Barley**: No. 1 Feed  

> These are standard quality classifications used in grain trading and determine eligibility for advance payments.

---

## **Advance Payment Rates (Effective August 1, 1986)**

- **Wheat**: $87 per tonne  
- **Oats**: $50 per tonne  
- **Barley**: $53 per tonne  

> These rates are fixed for the specified crop year and are used to calculate the amount of advance payment.

---

## **Interest on Advance Payments**

If interest is due on advance payments, the rate is determined as follows:

### **Interest Rate Formula**:
- The annual rate is:
  > **(Lowest lending rate offered by designated banks on the first banking day of the period) + 1.5%**

### **Periods**:
- **August 1 to January 31** of the following year:  
  → Interest rate = (Lowest bank lending rate during this period) + 1.5%
- **February 1 to July 31** of the same year:  
  → Interest rate = (Lowest bank lending rate during this period) + 1.5%

### **Designated Banks**:
- Royal Bank of Canada  
- Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  
- Bank of Montreal  
- Bank of Nova Scotia  
- Toronto-Dominion Bank  

> This ensures that interest is set at a fair, market-based rate with a minimum floor of 1.5%, protecting producers from excessive interest while maintaining financial accountability.

---

## **Reporting Obligations**

- The Board is required to **make reports to the Minister** of Agriculture (or relevant federal minister) as required.
- These reports may include:
  - Number of applications processed
  - Total advance payments made
  - Interest paid
  - Default cases
  - Financial summaries

> This ensures transparency and accountability to federal oversight.

---

## **Collection of Defaulted Payments**

- If a producer **fails to meet their delivery obligations** (undertaking):
  - The Board or Her Majesty (the Crown) may **initiate proceedings in the Federal Court of Canada** to recover:
    - The amount in default
    - Any accrued interest

> This provides a legal mechanism to enforce compliance and protect the Board’s interests.

---

## **Special Provisions (1984–85 and 1985–86 Crop Years)**

### **Unthreshed Grain Advance Payments**
- **1984–85 Crop Year**:
  - The Board may make advance payments for **unthreshed grain** (grain not yet processed) if an application is submitted **before June 15, 1985**.
- **1985–86 Crop Year**:
  - The Board may make advance payments for **unthreshed grain** or for **drying costs** (to help producers manage damp or tough grain) if an application is submitted **before June 1, 1986**.

> These provisions were introduced to support producers during specific agricultural challenges (e.g., poor drying conditions), providing financial relief during difficult growing seasons.
