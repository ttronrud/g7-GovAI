**Detailed Summary of the *Shipbuilding Temporary Assistance Program Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Shipbuilding Temporary Assistance Program Regulations** and may be cited as such. It serves as a framework for providing financial assistance (shipbuilding grants) to Canadian shipbuilders for the construction of eligible vessels.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Approved Cost of an Eligible Ship** | The cost of a vessel determined by the Minister under subsection 6(3). This is the basis for calculating the shipbuilding grant. |
| **Completed** | A vessel is considered completed when a certificate of registry has been issued for it. |
| **Contract** | A written agreement between a shipbuilder and a shipowner for the construction of one or more vessels, requiring a deposit of at least 5% of the contract price (or 5% of the first vessel's price if multiple vessels are involved). |
| **Contract Date** | The later of: (a) the date the contract is signed, or (b) the date the deposit is paid by the shipowner. |
| **Contract Price** | The total amount payable by the shipowner to the shipbuilder under the contract. |
| **Eligible Ship** | A vessel declared by the Minister under subsection 4(3) as eligible for funding under these regulations. |
| **Gross Tonnage** | Defined as per the *Canada Shipping Act*. |
| **Maximum Approved Cost** | The maximum cost assigned by the Minister under subsection 6(5), which caps the approved cost of a vessel. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. |
| **Proceeds of Disposition** | As defined in paragraph 13(21)(d) of the *Income Tax Act* — the amount received from the sale or disposal of an asset. |

| **Shipbuilding Grant** | The financial assistance paid to a shipbuilder for an eligible ship, as per these regulations. |
| **Vessel** | Any commercial or scientific vessel meeting specific tonnage or size thresholds: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;– ≥100 GT for self-propelled vessels |  
| &nbsp;&nbsp;– ≥200 GT for non-self-propelled vessels |  
| &nbsp;&nbsp;– ≥50 GT for tugs |  
| &nbsp;&nbsp;– ≥2 GT for submersibles operating at ≥1,000 feet depth |  
| &nbsp;&nbsp;– >75 feet in length for fishing vessels |

> *Note: These definitions establish the eligibility criteria for vessels to qualify for funding.*

### **3. Scope and Historical Context**
- These regulations apply **only to vessels whose construction began before November 27, 1970**, and whose **contract date is on or before March 31, 1975**.
- The regulation has been **revoked** (SOR/78-842, s.1), indicating it is no longer in force — likely superseded by newer legislation or programs.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: Despite the detailed content, the regulation is **no longer active**. The revocation in 1978 means that these rules do not currently govern shipbuilding grants in Canada.

### **4. Grant Eligibility and Application Process**

#### **Eligibility Conditions**
- A vessel must:
  - Be constructed in Canada by a Canadian shipbuilder.
  - Be registered in a country **other than Canada** (exceptionally allowed).
- The Minister may declare a vessel eligible even if it will be registered abroad, provided certain conditions are met.

#### **Ministerial Considerations Before Declaration**
Before declaring a vessel eligible, the Minister must assess:
1. Benefits to Canada from using Canadian materials and components.
2. Whether the shipbuilder can fulfill the contract without over-expanding facilities.
3. Availability of shipbuilding capacity for domestic needs.
4. Long-term competitive strength of the shipbuilder and Canadian shipbuilding industry.
5. Market development implications of the contract.

#### **Application Requirements**
- Applications must follow the form prescribed by the Minister.
- Must be submitted **within 60 days of the contract date**, or a longer period allowed by the Minister.

### **5. Grant Amounts (by Vessel Size and Contract Date)**

The grant is a percentage of the **approved cost** of the vessel, with tiered rates based on:
- Size of vessel (≤25,000 GT or >25,000 GT)
- Contract date (phased over time)

#### **For vessels ≤25,000 GT:**
| Contract Date Period | Grant Rate |
|----------------------|-----------|
| ≤ September 30, 1971 | 17% |
| October 1, 1971 – December 31, 1971 | 16½% |
| January 1, 1972 – March 31, 1972 | 16% |
| April 1, 1972 – March 31, 1973 | 15½% |
| April 1, 1973 – March 31, 1975 | 17% |

#### **For vessels >25,000 GT:**
| Contract Date Period | Grant Rate |
|----------------------|-----------|
| ≤ September 30, 1971 | 14% |
| October 1, 1971 – December 31, 1971 | 13½% |
| January 1, 1972 – March 31, 1972 | 13% |
| April 1, 1972 – March 31, 1973 | 12½% |
| April 1, 1973 – March 31, 1975 | 17% |

> 🔍 **Note**: The rate increases significantly after April 1973 for all vessels, especially larger ones — suggesting a policy shift to encourage continued investment.

### **6. Determination of Approved Cost**

The approved cost is determined as the **lower of two values**:
1. The **maximum approved cost** (set by the Minister).
2. The **cost verified by audit** under paragraph 7(b).

#### **Maximum Approved Cost Formula**
The Minister calculates the maximum approved cost by dividing the **contract price** by a multiplier, depending on the grant category:

| Grant Type | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|
| (1a, e) or (2e) | 0.830 |
| (1b) | 0.835 |
| (1c) | 0.840 |
| (1d) | 0.845 |
| (2a) | 0.860 |
| (2b) | 0.865 |
| (2c) | 0.870 |
| (2d) | 0.875 |

> 💡 This means the approved cost is **reduced** (typically by 15–20%) from the contract price to reflect a cap on funding — protecting public funds.

---

### **7. Grant Payment Structure**

All agreements must include the following provisions:

#### **Progress Payments**
- Up to **80% of the total grant** may be paid **before completion** of the vessel, based on the **maximum approved cost**.
- For **multi-vessel contracts**, an additional progress payment is made **after each vessel is completed**, subject to interim audit by the **Audit Services Bureau (Department of Supply and Services)**.
- The amount of such payments must be reasonable and provide adequate protection to Her Majesty’s interests.

#### **Final Payment**
- The **remaining balance** of the grant is paid **after all vessels are completed** and a full audit has been conducted.

#### **Audit Requirements**
- A full audit must be performed post-completion.
- For multi-vessel projects, **interim audits** are required during construction.
- Audits **exclude profit** when determining approved cost — ensuring only actual construction costs are considered.

#### **Mandatory Undertakings**
- Shipbuilders must commit to using **Canadian materials, components, and equipment** whenever they are available and internationally competitive.

#### **Other Provisions**
- The Minister may include additional terms deemed necessary to protect public interests or achieve the program's objectives.

### **8. Minister’s Discretionary Powers**

The Minister has broad authority to:
- **Authorize others** to sign agreements on behalf of the government.
- **Investigate** the financial responsibility of shipowners or shipbuilders to assess eligibility or approved cost.
- **Prescribe application forms** and **make rules** governing grant applications.

---

### **9. Adjustment for Replacement Vessels**

In cases where:
- A vessel is replaced using **proceeds of disposition** (e.g., proceeds from sale), or
- A deposit is paid out under Income Tax Act provisions (subsections 13(19)),

The **approved cost of the replacement vessel** is reduced by the amount used or paid out — **proportional to the original proceeds or deposit**.

> This prevents double-counting of funds and ensures that the grant is not inflated by asset replacements.

### **10. Key Policy Objectives**

The regulations were designed to:
- Support Canadian shipbuilding
