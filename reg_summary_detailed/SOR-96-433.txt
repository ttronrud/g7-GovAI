## 🔍 **Overview of the Regulation**

### ✅ Title:
**Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs)**  
Cited as: *R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1*  
Enacted via:  
- S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 5(1), s. 7, s. 14, s. 15(2), s. 20  
- S.C. 1996, c. 20, s. 101, s. 102  

These regulations establish the **rules governing aviation operations in Canada**, including aircraft design, airworthiness, flight operations, air traffic management, safety procedures, and regulatory compliance. They form the primary regulatory framework for all aspects of civil aviation in Canada.

## 📚 **Legal Authority and Basis**

The CARs are made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under specific provisions of the **Aeronautics Act**. The key sections cited include:

| Section/Subsection | Purpose |
|-------------------|--------|
| 4.3(2)a, 4.4(1)a, (2)a, 6.9(2)a, 7(2)a, 7.1(2)g, 7.7(1)h, 8.7(3)a, 9(1)a | Authority to regulate aircraft operations, air traffic, and safety |
| 4.6(2)a, 4.7(2)b | Regulation of airworthiness, maintenance, and operational limitations |
| 4.9c, 4.91d, 5e | Standards for aircraft equipment, flight manuals, and technical documentation |
| 6.71(2)f | Air traffic control services and airspace management |

These provisions allow the government to define standards for **aircraft certification, flight operations, air traffic services, and safety management**, ensuring compliance with both national and international aviation standards.

## 🏗️ **Structure and Key Components**

The regulation begins with a **definition section** that establishes precise meanings for over 100 terms used throughout the document. These definitions are critical for consistent interpretation and enforcement.

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of Key Definitions**

Below is a categorized breakdown of the most important and frequently used definitions in the CARs:

---

### 🚀 **Aircraft and Flight Categories**

| Term | Definition & Significance |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Aeroplane** | A powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with fixed surfaces for lift. The foundational category for most commercial and general aviation. |
| **Balloon** | Non-powered, lighter-than-air aircraft. Governed separately under special flight rules. |
| **Airship** | Powered lighter-than-air aircraft (e.g., dirigibles). Less common today; subject to specific regulations. |
| **Ultra-light aeroplane** | Divided into two types: <br> - **Basic ultra-light**: ≤2 seats, max take-off weight 544 kg, stall speed ≤39 knots (45 mph). <br> - **Advanced ultra-light**: Meets design standards in the *Design Standards for Advanced Ultra-light Aeroplanes*. |
| **Category** | Used in two contexts:<br> - **Flight crew licensing**: Classification of aircraft types (e.g., aeroplane, helicopter, glider).<br> - **Certification**: Grouping by use (e.g., normal, utility, aerobatic, transport). |

### 🛫 **Flight Operations and Procedures**

| Term | Definition & Significance |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Air transport service** | Commercial flights transporting people, cargo, or goods between two points. Requires an **air operator certificate**. |
| **Aerial work** | Commercial services other than transport or flight training (e.g., surveying, photography, agriculture). Requires a **special flight operations certificate**. |
| **Aerial work zone** | Area where aerial work occurs, especially over built-up areas or where people gather. Requires a **risk management plan** (aerial work zone plan). |
| **Aerobatic manoeuvre** | Any manoeuvre involving a bank angle >60°, abnormal attitude, or abnormal acceleration. Requires special certification and safety protocols. |
| **Contact approach** | IFR approach using visual references on the ground. Used when instrument approaches are not available. |
| **Air time** | Time from take-off until landing (in flight). Used for technical recordkeeping. |

---

### 🛩️ **Airspace and Air Traffic Management**

| Term | Definition & Significance |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Controlled airspace** | Fixed airspace with air traffic control (ATC) service. Defined in the *Designated Airspace Handbook*. |
| **Control zone** | Up to 3,000 feet AGL; includes all controlled airspace below that height. Exceptions may apply. |
| **Control area** | Specific zones like Arctic, Northern, or Southern Control Areas (previously included; *Arctic Control Area was repealed in 2006*). |
| **Air route / Airway** | Designated corridors for flight paths, either in controlled or uncontrolled airspace. |
| **Appropriate frequency** | Frequency used by pilots for communication with ATC. Based on: <br> - ATS unit assignment <br> - Mandatory frequency at aerodromes <br> - Canada Air Pilot or Canada Flight Supplement |
| **Air traffic advisory services** | Includes weather info, serviceability reports, but **excludes IFR ATC messages**. |

### 📜 **Certifications and Documentation**

| Term | Definition & Significance |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Air operator certificate (AOC)** | Authorizes an entity to operate commercial air services. Issued under Part VII. |
| **ATS operations certificate** | Authorizes operation of air traffic control or flight services units. |
| **Company operations manual (COM)** | Required by air operators; contains policies, procedures, and safety management systems for daily operations. |
