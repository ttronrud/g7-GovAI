To qualify for the remission, a supplier must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Subject to the Hazardous Products Act**  
   The supplier must be legally obligated under the HPA for the hazardous products involved.

2. **Claim relates to concentration of hazardous ingredient**  
   The claim must pertain specifically to the **concentration or concentration range** of a hazardous ingredient in a hazardous product.

3. **Filing date requirement**  
   The claim must have been filed **on or after February 11, 2015**, and **before April 18, 2018**.

   - Informed the Chief Screening Officer in writing that it intends to provide **one of the concentration ranges** set out in the **Hazardous Products Regulations as they read on April 18, 2018**.
     - This means the supplier is no longer seeking to hide the actual concentration and instead will disclose a standard, pre-approved range.
   - Confirmed in writing that it is **withdrawing its claim for exemption**.
     - This withdrawal must pertain to the specific exemption request related to the concentration of the hazardous ingredient.

6. **Validity of the information at time of repayment**

### **6. Significance and Public Interest Rationale**

This remission order serves several important public interest and policy objectives:

### **Conclusion**

This remission order is a targeted, time-bound, and conditionally based financial relief measure designed to address a specific regulatory transition in Canada’s chemical safety system. It supports both **regulatory clarity** and **fairness to industry**, while ensuring that public safety and transparency standards are maintained. By requiring suppliers to withdraw claims and adopt standardized concentration ranges, the government ensures that the safety data sheets remain useful and reliable tools for protecting human health and the environment.

It stands as a practical example of how regulatory policy can be adjusted to accommodate real-world challenges while upholding legal and public interest principles.
