**Detailed Summary of the Fort McPherson Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

The **Fort McPherson Airport Zoning Regulations** were formally adopted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**. This section empowers the government to adopt zoning regulations for airports to ensure safe operations and minimize risks to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.

A proposed version of these regulations was previously published in two successive issues of:
- *Canada Gazette Part I* (November 14 and 21, 1992),
- *News of the North* (January 25 and February 1, 1993),
- *L’Aquilon* (January 29 and February 5, 1993).

This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (such as landowners, municipalities, aviation stakeholders, and the public) to submit written representations or objections to the proposed rules.

Following public consultation, the final regulations were approved and enacted.

### **2. Title and Citation**

The regulations are officially titled:  
**"The Fort McPherson Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical spatial and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Fort McPherson Airport, located near Fort McPherson in the Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport’s centerline of runway 11–29, located 533.5 meters from the threshold of runway 29. It serves as the origin for all elevation and distance measurements. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (runway 11–29). These define safe zones for aircraft approaching the runway. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane set at **45 meters above the elevation of the ARP**, but capped at **9 meters above ground level** if the elevation of the ground is higher than 45 meters above ARP. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular landing area of the airport, including the runway, associated with runway 11–29. It is **90 meters wide** (45 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,187 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to intersect with the outer surface. These ensure a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

> **Elevation Reference**: The elevation of the Airport Reference Point is **42.1 meters above sea level**.

### **4. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all land**, including **public road allowances**, that is:
- Adjacent to or
- In the vicinity of the airport,

and is specifically delineated in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

The outer boundary of the regulated area is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point**.

This means that any land within a 4-kilometer radius of the ARP is subject to the zoning restrictions.

### **5. Prohibitions on Structures and Growth**

#### **(a) Construction Restrictions**
No person may:
- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object**, or
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object,

on any land subject to these regulations, **if the highest point of that object exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

This restriction ensures that no obstructions (such as trees, towers, or buildings) interfere with aircraft during critical phases of flight.

#### **(b) Natural Growth Management**
If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows to a height that exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may require the **owner or lessee** of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision ensures that natural features do not become hazards during flight operations.

### **6. Description of Key Surfaces (Detailed)**

#### **(a) Approach Surfaces**
- Two inclined planes, one for each end of runway 11–29.
- Each plane rises at a ratio of **1 meter vertically to 30 meters horizontally**.
- Extends to a horizontal line drawn **2,500 meters** from the end of the strip.
- The outer ends of this horizontal line are **295 meters** from the centerline of the runway.
- This horizontal line is **83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**.

> This ensures that aircraft have a clear path during approach, with sufficient clearance from ground obstructions.

#### **(b) Outer Surface**
- A horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 42.1 m + 45 m = 87.1 m above sea level).
- However, **if the ground surface is higher than 45 meters above the ARP**, the outer surface is **limited to 9 meters above ground level**.
- This prevents excessive height restrictions in areas where the terrain naturally rises.

#### **(c) Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a ratio of **1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally**.
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip** and its **approach surfaces**.
- Rise until they intersect with the **outer surface**.
- Ensures a gradual and safe transition from the runway edge to the outer boundary of the restricted zone.

#### **(d) Strip (Runway Area)**
- **Length**: 1,187 meters  
- **Width**: 90 meters (45 meters on each side of the centerline)  
- Located along runway 11–29, with the centerline aligned with the ARP.

### **7. Reference to Zoning Plan**

All spatial definitions and boundaries are based on **Fort McPherson Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2979**, dated **March 9, 1992**. This plan serves as the official technical and spatial foundation for the zoning rules.

---

### **8. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aircraft Safety**: To ensure safe takeoff, landing, and approach operations by maintaining adequate vertical clearance from the ground and surrounding terrain.
2. **Obstruction Control**: To prevent the construction or growth of structures or vegetation that could interfere with aircraft navigation.
3. **Consistency with Aviation Standards**: To align with international and Canadian aviation safety standards for airport zoning.
4. **Public and Environmental Protection**: To protect both the aviation environment and the surrounding communities by establishing clear boundaries and height limits.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions.
- Compliance is mandatory for all landowners and operators within the defined zone.
- Violations may lead to penalties or enforcement actions by Transport Canada.

### **Conclusion**

The **Fort McPherson Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use around the airport to ensure the safety of aviation operations. By defining clear elevation limits, spatial boundaries, and enforcement mechanisms, the regulations balance the needs of aviation safety with land use and environmental considerations. They reflect a proactive approach to preventing hazards and are grounded in both legal authority and technical aviation standards.

These regulations remain a key component of the airport’s operational safety infrastructure and continue to serve as a model for similar airport zoning in Canada.
