Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the regulation you provided:

---

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers and Functions from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to the Minister of Health (Effective April 1, 2013)**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The transfer of powers and functions is authorized under:
- **Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)**  
  This provision allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers, particularly in the context of public service reorganization.

#### **2. Key Transfer: Powers and Functions from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to the Minister of Health**
The following powers, duties, and functions are being transferred **to the Minister of Health**:
- **Powers, duties, and functions under Section 160c of the Health of Animals Regulations (R.S., c. P-34)**  
  Specifically, those relating to **permits** issued under:
  - Paragraph **51(a)** and **51.1(a) and (b)** of the Health of Animals Regulations.

> These permits pertain to the **movement, handling, or use of terrestrial animals** (including birds and amphibians) that may carry **terrestrial animal pathogens**.

#### **3. Scope of the Transfer – What is Included**
The transfer applies to:
- **Terrestrial animal pathogens**, including those from:
  - **Avian animals** (e.g., birds)
  - **Amphibian animals** (e.g., frogs, salamanders)

#### **4. Exclusions – What is NOT Included**
The transfer **does not apply** to pathogens that:
- Cause an **animal disease listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)** as an **OIE-Listed disease, infection, or infestation**:
  - **If that disease is not indigenous to Canada** (i.e., not naturally occurring or established in Canada)
  - **If the disease is an emerging animal disease** (a new or rapidly spreading disease)

> This means that diseases like **avian influenza (H5N1)** or other OIE-listed diseases that are either foreign-origin or newly emerging are **exempt** from this transfer.

#### **5. Transfer of Agency Unit**
In addition to the functional transfer, there is a **transfer of a specific unit within the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)**:
- The **Domestic Terrestrial Animal Pathogen Unit (DTAPU)**  
  This unit is responsible for the **control and supervision** of terrestrial animal pathogens within Canada.

> This unit is **transferred from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** to the **Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)**.

#### **6. Effective Date**
- The transfer becomes effective on **April 1, 2013**.

### **Purpose and Rationale**
This regulatory action reflects a strategic realignment of responsibilities to:
- Strengthen **public health protection** by placing animal pathogen oversight under the **Minister of Health**, given the potential for zoonotic transmission (diseases that can jump from animals to humans).
- Improve **inter-agency coordination** between animal health and public health authorities.
- Ensure that emerging or high-risk animal diseases are managed through a public health lens, particularly in cases where pathogens could pose risks to human health.

The exclusion of OIE-listed diseases not indigenous to Canada or emerging diseases ensures that **critical biosecurity and international compliance obligations** are preserved, as these diseases require specialized, international-level monitoring and response.

### **Key Takeaways**
| Element | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Transferring Minister** | Minister of Health |
| **From** | Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food (via Health of Animals Regulations) |
| **What is transferred** | Permit-related powers and duties for terrestrial animal pathogens (including avian and amphibian) |
| **Exclusions** | OIE-listed diseases not indigenous to Canada or emerging animal diseases |
| **Agency Unit Transfer** | Domestic Terrestrial Animal Pathogen Unit (DTAPU) from CFIA to PHAC |
| **Effective Date** | April 1, 2013 |

---

### **Implications**
- **Public Health Focus**: The integration of animal pathogen control into public health governance enhances preparedness for zoonotic threats.
- **Regulatory Clarity**: The exclusion of non-indigenous and emerging diseases ensures that Canada maintains compliance with international standards (OIE) and avoids overreach in disease control.
- **Inter-agency Collaboration**: The transfer to PHAC enables better integration between animal health and human health surveillance systems.

---

This regulation exemplifies a broader trend in Canada toward **one health approaches**, where human, animal, and environmental health are managed collaboratively to prevent and respond to public health threats.
