### **Detailed Summary of the North Battleford Airport Zoning Regulations (1991)**

The **North Battleford Airport Zoning Regulations**, made under **section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, are a set of legally binding rules designed to manage land use and physical development around the North Battleford Airport in Saskatchewan. These regulations were established after a formal public consultation process and serve to ensure the safety, operational efficiency, and environmental integrity of the airport by restricting construction and land use near the airport.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Procedural Background**

- **Authority**: The regulations were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Acting Minister of Transport**, pursuant to **section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.
- **Public Consultation**: A copy of the proposed regulations was published in:
  - Two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 16 and March 23, 1991**;
  - Two successive issues of the *News Optimist* on **June 26 and July 3, 1991**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., residents, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

This procedural step ensures transparency and public participation in the regulation-making process, a key principle in Canadian administrative law.

---

## **2. Purpose and Scope of the Regulations**

### **Purpose**
To establish **zoning restrictions** that:
- Prevent obstacles to aircraft operations (e.g., tall structures, vegetation, waste disposal);
- Maintain visual and physical clearance around the airport;
- Ensure safe flight paths during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

### **Scope**
The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of North Battleford Airport**, including:
- Public road allowances;
- Private properties;
- All areas described in **Part VI of the schedule**.

This includes not only the airport runway area but also surrounding zones that could affect aircraft safety.

## **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The North Battleford Airport, located near North Battleford, Saskatchewan. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a datum for all measurements. It is located at the end of runway 12, defined by precise astronomical bearings and distances. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip. It defines the maximum height allowed for structures during aircraft approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the ARP elevation (or 9 meters above ground if the ground is lower than 9 m). It sets the upper limit for all structures outside the approach and transitional zones. |
| **Strip** | The designated area of the runway and its adjacent landing area, including taxiways and runways. It is defined by width and length for each runway direction. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane that connects the approach surface to the outer surface, rising at a specific slope from the lateral edges of the strip. It ensures a smooth transition between runway zones and the outer boundary. |

> **Elevation of Airport Reference Point**:  
> The ARP is located at **541.9 meters above sea level**, which serves as the baseline for all height measurements in the regulations.

## **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

### **Prohibition on Structures**
No person may:
- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object**;
- Add any **extension or modification** to an existing building, structure, or object;

**on any land subject to these regulations**, if the **highest point** of that object exceeds any of the following surfaces:
1. The **approach surfaces**;
2. The **outer surface**;
3. The **transitional surfaces**.

This rule applies to all physical features, including:
- Buildings;
- Trees or structures of natural growth;
- Antennas, signs, or towers.

---

### **Regulation on Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows above the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require the owner or occupier** to **remove the excessive growth**.
- This provision allows for flexibility in managing natural landscapes while maintaining safety standards.

> *Note*: This reflects a balance between environmental preservation and aviation safety.

---

### **Prohibition on Waste Disposal**

- No owner or occupier may **use any land under these regulations** for the **disposal of waste** that:
  - Is **edible** or **attractive to birds**;
  - Could attract bird populations that pose a hazard to aircraft.

> **Rationale**: Bird strikes are a major aviation safety risk. Preventing food sources or waste that attract birds reduces the risk of collisions during flight.

## **5. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces (Based on Zoning Plan No. E.2745, Nov 30, 1989)**

### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

- **Location**: End of runway 12, starting from the threshold.
- **Coordinates**:
  - Bearings: South 44°10′06″ East (astronomical, referenced to runway 12–30 centerline);
  - Path:
    - From threshold of runway 12 → South 44°10′06″ East for 738.8 meters;
    - Then South 45°49′54″ West for 203.4 meters → reaches ARP.

> This point is the origin for all height and distance measurements.

---

### **B. Approach Surfaces**

These are **inclined planes** rising from each end of the runway strips to ensure aircraft have a clear visual and physical path during landing.

| Runway | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Runway 06 (approach 06)** | - Inclined plane: 1 m vertical to 20 m horizontal<br> - Rises to a horizontal line 2,500 m from end of strip<br> - Outer ends: 280 m from centerline<br> - Height: 125 m above end of strip |
| **Runway 24 (approach 24)** | - Same as 06 (same slope, distance, height) |
| **Runway 12 (approach 12)** | - Inclined plane: 1 m vertical to 40 m horizontal<br> - Rises to a horizontal line 3,000 m from end of strip<br> - Outer ends: 525 m from centerline<br> - Height: 75 m above end of strip |
| **Runway 30 (approach 30)** | - Same as 12 |

> These surfaces are critical during **final approach** to ensure pilots can see the runway and avoid obstacles.

---

### **C. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 541.9 m + 45 m = 586.9 m above sea level).
- **Exception**: Where the ground elevation is less than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- This ensures that even on low-lying terrain, there is a minimum safe height for structures.

> The outer surface acts as a **general boundary** for all development around the airport.

---

### **D. Strips (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|------|--------|
| **06–24** | 60 meters wide (30 m on each side of centerline) | 842 meters long |
| **12–30** | 150 meters wide (75 m on each side) | 1,644 meters long |

> The 12–30 runway is significantly wider and longer, indicating it is a primary runway for the airport.

---

### **E. Transitional Surfaces**

These connect the **approach surfaces** to the **outer surface**, ensuring a smooth, safe transition in elevation.

| Runway | Slope | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **06–24** | 1 m vertical to 5 m horizontal | Rises at right angles to the centerline and extends from lateral edges of strip and approach surfaces until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface |
| **12–30** | 1 m vertical to 7 m horizontal | Steeper slope than 06–24, reflecting the longer and wider runway; rises at a gentler but steeper gradient |

> These surfaces prevent abrupt changes in terrain or structure height, which could interfere with aircraft visibility or navigation.

---

## **6. Boundary of the Outer Limits of Land (Zoning Boundary)**

The boundary of all regulated land is defined by a **complex, detailed survey description** that includes:

- **Land parcels and sections** in Township 44, Range 16, West of the 3rd Meridian;
- **Road allowances** (e.g., along 98th Street, 100th Street, etc.);
- **Major roads and development corridors** (e.g., River Valley Drive, Bennett Crescent, Douglas Avenue);
- **Natural features** (e.g., North Saskatchewan River);
- A **circular boundary** of **4,
