### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Number**: SOR/2016-165  
  This is a statutory regulation issued under the authority of a federal statute in Canada, typically related to health, safety, or environmental standards. The "SOR" stands for "Statutory Instrument of the Regulations" and is part of the official gazette system for federal regulations.

It was formally repealed by **section 2 of SOR/2016-165**, which was published in the Canada Gazette and came into effect on the date specified in the regulation (typically the date of publication or a subsequent date as noted in the regulation).
