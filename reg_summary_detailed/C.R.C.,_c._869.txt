**Detailed Summary of the Cosmetic Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Cosmetic Regulations* are a set of administrative rules under the *Food and Drugs Act* (Act) that govern the **import, manufacture, sale, labelling, and safety** of cosmetics in Canada. These regulations ensure that cosmetics are safe, properly labelled, and compliant with health and consumer protection standards. The regulations define key terms, establish strict labelling requirements, regulate ingredient use, and impose safety restrictions—particularly regarding hazardous substances and vulnerable body areas.

They apply to all cosmetics sold or imported into Canada, with exceptions for products regulated under other federal statutes (e.g., food, natural health products).

## **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

The following definitions clarify key terms used throughout the regulations:

## **Inspector Powers and Responsibilities**

An inspector (authorized under the Act and these regulations) may:

- Take photographs of any cosmetic or related materials.
- Inspect places where cosmetics are manufactured, stored, or packaged.
- Examine equipment or materials used in cosmetic production.
- Review labelling and advertising materials.

These powers are intended to ensure compliance with safety and labelling standards.

## **Importation Prohibitions and Exceptions**

> **Section 6 – Prohibition on Importing Violating Cosmetics**

- **No person may import a cosmetic into Canada for sale if its sale would violate the Act or these Regulations.**

> **Exception – Relabelling or Modification for Compliance**

- A person may import a cosmetic **only if**:
  1. They notify an inspector of the proposed importation;  
  2. The cosmetic will be **relabelled or modified under the inspector’s supervision** to make it compliant with Canadian law.

> **Compliance Deadline**

- The cosmetic must be **relabelled or modified within three months** of importation.  
- Failure to do so means the product cannot be sold.

---

## **Sampling and Analysis Procedures**

> **Section 23 – Sample Collection and Handling**

When an inspector takes a sample:
- The sample must be divided into **three parts** (owner’s portion, sample, duplicate sample), **sealed**, and clearly labelled.
- The **owner’s portion** is returned to the owner.
- The **sample and duplicate** are sent to an analyst for testing.

> **Exception to Division**

If dividing the sample would interfere with analysis, the **entire quantity** is sealed and sent to the analyst.

This ensures scientific integrity and allows for verification without compromising the original product.

## **Labelling and Advertising Restrictions**

### **1. Prohibited Claims**
- **No claim** may be made on a label or advertisement that implies:
  - The cosmetic affects the chemistry of skin, hair, or teeth;  
  - That the product will not cause health injury (i.e., “safe” or “harmless” claims without evidence).
- Manufacturers must **provide evidence** to support any such claim upon request by the Minister.

### **2. Language and Clarity Requirements**
- All required information must be shown in **both English and French**, **except for INCI names**.
- Information must be **clearly legible** and remain so throughout the product’s useful life (or refill cycle).
- If a cosmetic has only one label, it must contain **all required information** for both inner and outer labels.

### **3. Contact Information**
- The **inner label** must include a way for consumers to contact the manufacturer (e.g., phone number, email, website, postal address).

### **4. Product Identity**
- The identity of the cosmetic (common name or function) must be clearly stated **unless it is obvious** (e.g., “sunscreen”).

  - Ingredients with **no INCI name** must be listed by **chemical name**.

> **Order of Listing**

> **Fragrance and Flavour**
- The words **“parfum”** (fragrance) and **“aroma”** (flavour) may be added at the end of the list to indicate their role.

> **Exception for Small or Ornamental Packaging**
- If the container is too small to fit the ingredient list:
  - The list may appear on a **tag, tape, or card** affixed to the container.
  - Or on a **website**, provided the outer label includes a statement directing consumers to the website and specifying its location.
