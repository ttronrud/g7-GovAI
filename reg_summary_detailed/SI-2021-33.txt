**Detailed Summary of the Regulation on the Striped Bass (St. Lawrence River Population) under the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), specifically pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2)** of the Act. These subsections empower the Governor in Council (the federal government) to refer matters involving species at risk to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for further assessment or review when additional scientific information is required.

The decision was made by **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, indicating that the federal government is taking a science-based, precautionary approach to species conservation.

### **2. Key Action Taken**
- The **assessment of the status of the Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) St. Lawrence River (SLR) population** has been **referred back to COSEWIC** for further evaluation.
- The **Minister of the Environment** has approved the inclusion of a **public statement** (attached as an annex to this Order) in the **public registry established under Section 120 of SARA**. This statement explains the reasons for the referral and outlines the scientific and administrative context.

### **3. Background and Historical Status of the Striped Bass (SLR Population)**

#### **Original Population Status**
- The **historical Striped Bass population in the St. Lawrence River (SLR)** was listed as **endangered** in **Schedule 1** of SARA.
- The **last naturally occurring sighting** of a member of this original population was in **1968**, indicating a long period of absence and likely local extinction.

#### **Restocking Efforts**
- In **2002**, the province of **Quebec initiated restocking programs** using Striped Bass sourced from a **separate population in the Miramichi River** (New Brunswick).
- These fish were introduced into the St. Lawrence River to restore some level of fishery or ecological function.

#### **COSEWIC Assessments and Key Changes in Status**

| Year | Assessment Outcome | Notes |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| **2004** | Classified as **extirpated** | COSEWIC concluded that the original SLR population had been lost due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and other threats. |
| **2011** | Added to Schedule 1 as **extirpated** | Official listing under SARA reflected the extinction of the native SLR population. |
| **2012** | Reclassified as **endangered** | COSEWIC included **stocked fish from the Miramichi River** in its assessment, suggesting that the population in the St. Lawrence River was now viable and at risk. This reclassification was controversial and based on the inclusion of non-native (introduced) individuals. |
| **August 2019** | Status changed from **extirpated to endangered** | This change was based on the 2012 assessment and the presence of stocked fish. The government recognized the population as endangered due to the presence of introduced individuals. |

#### **November 2019 COSEWIC Addendum**
- At a **Wildlife Species Assessment Meeting in November 2019**, COSEWIC issued an **addendum to its 2012 assessment**.
- The key conclusion of this addendum:
  - **The current Striped Bass individuals in the St. Lawrence River are not part of the original historical SLR population.**
  - They are **introduced (stocked) fish** from the Miramichi River.
  - Therefore, **the 2012 classification was scientifically flawed** because it incorrectly treated introduced fish as part of the same population.
- As a result, COSEWIC **reclassified the Striped Bass (SLR population) as extinct** — not merely extirpated — based on its **current understanding of population boundaries and genetic distinctiveness**.

> **Important Note**: This reclassification applies only to the **historical SLR population** and does *not* apply to the introduced fish in the river.

### **4. Legal and Policy Implications Under SARA**

- SARA applies to **all individuals of a species** found in Canada, including those in the St. Lawrence River.
- The **2011 listing** and the **August 2019 reclassification** were based on the **entire population** in the river — including both historical and introduced fish.
- However, **COSEWIC’s 2019 addendum clarifies that the introduced fish are not part of the original designatable unit (DU)** — a key concept in SARA that defines distinct populations for conservation purposes.
- Because the **provisions of SARA apply to all individuals in the river**, the government must now determine whether:
  - The **introduced fish** should be considered part of the SLR population for legal protection,
  - Or whether they represent a **separate population** that should be assessed independently.

---

### **5. Reason for Referral Back to COSEWIC**

The **Minister of the Environment**, advised by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, has concluded that:

- The **current status of the Striped Bass in the St. Lawrence River** — particularly the **risk status of the introduced fish** — is **uncertain and requires further scientific evaluation**.
- The **2012 assessment** incorrectly conflated the historical SLR population with the stocked Miramichi-derived population.
- The **2019 COSEWIC addendum** provides a critical correction, but does not fully resolve the issue of how these introduced fish should be classified in terms of:
  - Population structure,
  - Conservation status,
  - Legal protection under SARA,
  - Future management and recovery planning.

Therefore, the **Governor in Council has referred the matter back to COSEWIC** to:
- Provide a **clear, up-to-date scientific assessment** of the current population in the St. Lawrence River,
- Clarify whether the **introduced fish constitute a distinct designatable unit**,
- Evaluate the **risk status** of the current population (including both historical and introduced components),
- Determine whether the species or population should remain listed as endangered, extirpated, or extinct under SARA.

### **6. Government Commitment and Next Steps**

- The **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)** has committed to **collaborating closely with COSEWIC** on this issue.
- The goal is to ensure that any future listing or delisting decision is based on **sound, transparent, and scientifically rigorous data**.
- The outcome of this review will inform:
  - Conservation strategies,
  - Fisheries management,
  - Recovery planning,
  - Public policy and stakeholder engagement.

### **7. Key Takeaways and Significance**

| Point | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| **Scientific Clarity** | The regulation underscores the importance of distinguishing between **historical populations** and **introduced or stocked individuals** in conservation assessments. |
| **Legal Precision** | SARA’s application to all individuals in a region requires careful interpretation to avoid misclassification or inappropriate protection. |
| **Policy Reassessment** | The referral highlights that even after a species is reclassified, **scientific reassessment may be necessary** if new evidence emerges. |
| **Inter-Agency Collaboration** | The involvement of both Environment and Fisheries and Oceans demonstrates interdepartmental coordination in species at risk governance. |
| **Public Transparency** | The inclusion of the statement in the public registry ensures that the public and stakeholders are informed about the rationale behind the referral. |

### **Conclusion**

This regulation reflects a **critical moment in the management of the Striped Bass in the St. Lawrence River**. It acknowledges that the **original population is likely extinct**, and that **current fish in the river are not genetically or ecologically part of that population**. However, because SARA applies to all individuals present in Canada, the government must now determine whether the **introduced fish** should be protected as part of a new, distinct population or if they should be excluded from the species’ status.

By referring the matter back to **COSEWIC**, the federal government is taking a **science-led, transparent, and responsible approach** to ensure that conservation decisions are grounded in accurate biological and ecological understanding — protecting both biodiversity and the integrity of species at risk legislation.

--- 

**Final Note**: This referral is not a reversal of previous decisions, but a **corrective and necessary step** to ensure that future conservation actions are based on accurate, up-to-date science.
