## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations**

### 📌 **Background and Purpose**
The regulation was enacted by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) in response to the **Russian Federation’s actions** that are deemed to constitute a **grave breach of international peace and security**, posing a serious risk of international crisis. This includes actions such as military aggression against Ukraine and systemic human rights violations.

The primary objective is to **apply targeted economic sanctions** against individuals, entities, and goods linked to Russia, in order to:
- Impose economic pressure on the Russian state;
- Prevent support for actions undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty;
- Protect Canadian interests and international norms;
- Support the stability and security of international institutions.

These measures are grounded in **subsections 4(1) to (3)** of the *Special Economic Measures Act*, which empower the government to impose restrictions on trade, finance, and technology related to designated persons or entities.
