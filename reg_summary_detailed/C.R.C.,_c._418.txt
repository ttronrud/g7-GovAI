The provided text consists of four identical references to a repealed regulation:

**[Repealed, SOR/2008-31, s. 1]**

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (identified by section 1 of the Statutory Instrument SOR/2008-31) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by another legislative or regulatory instrument.

- **SOR/2008-31** refers to the *Statutory Instrument of 2008, No. 31*, which is a regulatory document issued under the authority of the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on context).
- **Section 1** of that instrument contains the provision that was repealed.
- The repetition of the same line four times suggests a formatting or technical error in the original document, possibly due to duplication during transcription or digital processing. It does not indicate that the regulation was repealed four times or that multiple sections were affected.

### Key Points:
- The regulation referenced in section 1 of SOR/2008-31 is **no longer in force**.
- It has been **replaced or superseded** by a subsequent regulation or policy, or it was deemed obsolete and removed from the legal framework.
- The repeal was formally enacted through the same instrument (SOR/2008-31), which may have included a list of repealed sections or provisions.
- Without the full text of SOR/2008-31, it is not possible to determine the **subject matter** of the repealed regulation (e.g., whether it related to workplace safety, environmental standards, licensing, or another area).

### Conclusion:
The provided information does not contain the content of the repealed regulation itself, only a notice of its repeal. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation's content cannot be provided. The only factual summary is that:

> A regulation originally contained in section 1 of Statutory Instrument SOR/2008-31 has been formally repealed and is no longer in effect. The exact subject or provisions of the repealed regulation are not available in the given text, and the repeated references appear to be a technical or formatting error.

To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, access to the full text of SOR/2008-31 would be required—this can be found in official government databases such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Canada Law Centre* website.
