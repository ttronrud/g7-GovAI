    - Subsection **164(1.3)** (procedures for verification),
    - And **paragraph 167.1(b)** (provision for implementing public announcements).
  - The regulations give effect to a **public announcement made on November 1, 2002**, which established the framework for verifying the origin of goods under the CCRFTA.

#### **3. Methods of Conducting a Verification of Origin**

A verification of origin may be conducted in **one or more of the following ways**, in addition to a physical verification visit:

1. **Review of a completed verification questionnaire** submitted by:
   - The exporter or producer of the goods, or
   - A producer or supplier of a material.

2. **Review of a written response** received from a person referenced in paragraph (b) to a verification letter.

3. **Review of any other information** obtained from a person referred to in paragraph (b) (e.g., invoices, shipping documents, records).

> *Note*: The physical visit is not the only method — documentation and correspondence can suffice if properly submitted.

---

#### **4. Prescribed Premises for Verification Visits**

The following **premises in Costa Rica** are designated as **prescribed premises** for verification visits:

- The **exporter or producer** of the goods.
- The **producer or supplier** of a material used in the production of those goods.

This means that Canadian customs officers may conduct on-site inspections only at these specific locations in Costa Rica.

---

#### **5. Procedure for a Verification Visit**

An officer may conduct a verification visit **only if** the following conditions are met:

- **Written notice** is sent at least **five working days before** the visit to:
  1. The person whose premises are being visited,
  2. The **Customs Administration of Costa Rica**, and
  3. (If requested) the **Embassy of Costa Rica in Canada**.

- The **person whose premises are being visited must consent** to the visit.

**Content of the Notice (must include):**
- Identity of the Canadian customs officer sending the notice.
- Name of the person whose premises are being visited.
- Date and location of the visit.
- Object and scope of the visit (including description of goods or materials involved).
- Name and title of the officer.
- Legal authority for the visit (i.e., reference to section 42.1 of the Customs Act).

---

#### **6. Right to Postpone a Verification Visit**

- **Customs Administration of Costa Rica** may **postpone** the visit by sending a **written request to the Canadian officer** within **15 days** of receiving the notice.
- The **maximum postponement period** is:
  - **60 days** from the date of the notice (unless otherwise agreed).
  - A **longer period** may be agreed upon by both administrations.

- The **person receiving the notice** may also request a postponement **once**, within **15 days** of receiving the notice, for a period not exceeding 60 days (or a longer period agreed upon by both parties).

> *Note*: This provides flexibility to allow for logistical or operational reasons.

---

#### **7. Observers During Verification Visits**

- Any person receiving a notice may **designate two observers** to be present during the visit.
- Observers are **not permitted to participate in the verification process** beyond observation.
- The designated observer must be **identified to the officer conducting the visit** in advance.

> *Purpose*: Ensures transparency and accountability in the verification process.

---

#### **8. Compliance with GAAP (Accounting Standards)**

- If, during a verification, an officer determines that a producer has **failed to record production costs in accordance with GAAP in Costa Rica**, the officer must send a **written notice** to the producer.
- The producer must **correct and record those costs** in accordance with GAAP **within 60 days** of receiving the notice.

> *Significance*: Ensures that cost documentation meets internationally recognized standards, which is essential for determining whether goods meet the origin criteria under the CCRFTA.

---

#### **9. Requirements for Verification Letters and Questionnaires**

Every verification letter or questionnaire must:

- Identify the **Customs Administration of Canada** and the **name and title of the officer** sending it.
- Clearly describe the **goods or materials** subject to the origin verification.
- Specify a **response period of at least 30 days** from the date of receipt.

> *Note*: This ensures timely and meaningful responses from producers.

---

#### **10. Request for Extension of Response Period**

- A person may, **on a single occasion**, request an extension **within 30 days** of receiving the letter or questionnaire.
- The extension is granted for **no more than an additional 30 days**.

> *Purpose*: Accommodates situations where additional time is needed to gather or verify records.

---

#### **11. Grounds for Denying or Withdrawing Preferential Tariff Treatment**

Under **subsection 42.1(2)** of the Customs Act, preferential tariff treatment under the CCRFTA may be **denied or withdrawn** if:

1. The exporter or producer **does not consent** to a verification visit within **30 days** of receiving the notice under paragraph 4(1)(a);
2. The person is **required to maintain records** under the laws of Costa Rica but:
   - Fails to maintain them properly, or
   - Denies access to those records;
3. The person **fails to respond** to the verification letter or complete and return the questionnaire within the specified time (or after an extension).

> *This creates a direct link between compliance with documentation and the continuation of tariff benefits.*

---

#### **12. Re-Determination of Origin**

- If an officer determines that goods are **not eligible** for preferential treatment under the CCRFTA (e.g., due to non-compliance), they must send a **written notice** to the exporter or producer.
- The notice must:
  - State that preferential treatment will be **denied or withdrawn**.
  - Specify the **date after which** this action will take effect.
  - Provide a **period during which** the exporter or producer may submit **written comments or additional information** regarding the origin of the goods.

- A **re-determination of origin** cannot occur earlier than **10 days after** the notice is received.

> *Purpose*: Provides a fair opportunity for the exporter to respond before a final decision is made.

---

#### **13. Delivery and Confirmation of Communications**

All notices — including:
- Verification letters,
- Verification questionnaires,
- Notices of intent to conduct a visit,
- Notices of re-determination of origin,
- Requests for extensions,

— must be **sent by any method that provides confirmation of receipt** (e.g., email, registered mail, courier with tracking).

> *Ensures accountability and traceability of all communications.*
