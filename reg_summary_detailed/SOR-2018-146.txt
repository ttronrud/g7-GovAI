### **Eligibility Criteria for Designation as an Analyst**

An individual may be designated as a Cannabis Analyst only if they meet **one of the following three qualification pathways**:

#### **1. Academic Degree in a Science-Related Field**
- The individual must hold a **degree in a science** directly related to the specific analytical work they are to perform.
- The degree must be:
  - Awarded by a **Canadian university**, or
  - Awarded by a **foreign university** that is **recognized** by either:
    - A Canadian university, or
    - A Canadian professional association (e.g., a recognized scientific or analytical body such as a laboratory accreditation body or professional engineering/science society).

> *Note:* Recognition ensures that the foreign degree meets equivalent academic standards to those established in Canada.

#### **2. Combination of Work Experience and Formal Education**
- The individual must possess a **combination** of:
  - **Relevant work experience** in the duties of an analyst (i.e., experience directly related to analytical testing of cannabis or similar substances), and
