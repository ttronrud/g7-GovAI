**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) Lake Utopia Small-Bodied Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
August 12, 2019

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which empowers the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate and define the critical habitat of a listed species. This action is taken in accordance with the recovery strategy for the Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) Lake Utopia small-bodied population.

### **Key Provisions and Context:**

1. **Species at Risk Designation:**  
   The Rainbow Smelt (*Osmerus mordax*) Lake Utopia small-bodied population is officially recognized as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1** of the *Species at Risk Act*. This classification means the species is at risk of becoming extinct and is subject to legal protection and recovery efforts.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification:**  
   A formal recovery strategy for this specific population has been developed and is **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**. This strategy identifies the specific areas—known as "critical habitat"—that are essential for the survival and recovery of the population. Critical habitat refers to the physical locations where the species requires to survive and reproduce, including necessary conditions such as water quality, temperature, and spawning grounds.

3. **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas (Subsection 58(2)b):**  
   A key legal consideration is that **no portion of the critical habitat identified in this Order falls within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b of SARA**.  
   - Subsection 58(2)b of SARA prohibits the Minister from designating critical habitat in areas that are:
     - Located in a place where the species is not found or is not present,
     - Or where designation would conflict with other federal or provincial laws or policies (e.g., land use, development, or conservation conflicts).
   - The absence of overlap with such prohibited areas confirms that the designation is legally valid and does not violate procedural or policy constraints.

4. **Legal Authority and Purpose:**  
   The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is authorized under **subsection 58(1)** of SARA to designate critical habitat for listed species. This Order formally defines and legally establishes the critical habitat for the Rainbow Smelt Lake Utopia small-bodied population based on the recovery strategy.  
   - This designation ensures that federal activities (such as development, infrastructure projects, or resource extraction) that may impact this habitat must be assessed and, where necessary, modified to avoid harm.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette), which is typically within a few days of issuance. This ensures that the legal protections are immediately enforceable.

### **Implications and Significance:**

- **Conservation and Protection:**  
  By formally identifying and protecting the critical habitat, the Order ensures that the ecological needs of the Rainbow Smelt population—such as spawning grounds, water temperature, and connectivity—are preserved. This supports the long-term recovery of the species.

- **Legal Enforcement:**  
  Any federal project or activity that may affect the designated critical habitat must undergo a **Section 58 assessment** under SARA. If such activities are likely to have a significant adverse effect, they must be avoided or mitigated.

- **Transparency and Public Access:**  
  The inclusion of the recovery strategy and critical habitat in the **Species at Risk Public Registry** ensures transparency and public access to information about the species and its conservation needs.

- **Scientific and Ecological Basis:**  
  The designation is grounded in scientific research and recovery planning, reflecting the best available ecological data on the species’ habitat requirements.

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation formally establishes the critical habitat for the Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) Lake Utopia small-bodied population under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is a legally binding step in the species’ recovery process, ensuring that essential ecological areas are protected from harmful federal activities. The Order is valid, compliant with SARA’s procedural requirements (not falling under prohibited areas), and serves as a foundation for future conservation planning and enforcement.
