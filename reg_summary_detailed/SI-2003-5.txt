- Any person described in Article 3 (i.e., those subject to the legislation) has **the same rights and obligations** as citizens of that country.

#### ✅ Benefits are:
- **Not reduced, modified, suspended, or canceled** solely because the person resides in the other country.

### 🔹 **4. Residency and Work Rules (Article 6–8)**

#### 📌 Rule 6: Employment in a Party's Territory
- An **employed person** working in a Party’s territory is **subject only to that Party’s legislation**.

#### 📌 Rule 7: Self-Employed Persons
- A self-employed person who would otherwise be subject to both Parties’ laws is subject **only to the legislation of the Party where they reside**.

#### 📌 Rule 8: Temporary Detachments
- If an employee is sent **temporarily** to work in the other Party’s territory (e.g., for a related employer), they remain subject to the **first Party’s legislation**.
- This coverage is **limited to 60 months** without **prior written consent** from both competent authorities or their delegated institutions.

> ⚠️ This prevents abuse of temporary work arrangements to gain benefits from both countries.

#### 📌 Government Employment

- If a person is **residing in a Party** and working for the other Party, they are still subject to the **first Party’s legislation**.

### 🔹 **5. Creditable Periods and Totalization Rules**

This section outlines how periods of contributions/residence are combined to determine eligibility for benefits.

#### ✅ Totalization of Creditable Periods:
- **For OAS (Canada)**:
  - A period of **presence/residence in the Czech Republic** where the person contributed to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial pension plan is counted as a **period of residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/common-law partner and dependants (if not subject to Czech employment/self-employment).
  - Conversely, a period of residence in Canada where the person contributed to the Czech Republic’s legislation **does NOT count** toward Canadian residence for OAS eligibility (unless under specific conditions).

> 🔍 Only **contributions due to employment or self-employment** count.

#### ✅ CPP Eligibility:
- A **calendar year** with **at least 90 days** of creditable periods under Czech legislation counts as a **creditable year** under the CPP.

#### ✅ Czech Republic Eligibility:
- A **calendar year** of CPP contributions is treated as a **creditable period** under Czech law.
- A period of residence under the **Old Age Security Act (OAS)** that is **not part of a CPP creditable period** is also treated as a creditable period under Czech law.
- For **invalidity or survivor benefits**, CPP creditable years are treated as creditable under Czech law.

> ✅ This enables cross-border recognition of contributions and promotes fairness.

#### ✅ Final Eligibility Determination:
- If a person does **not meet eligibility** due to insufficient creditable periods, totalization is applied **across all periods** (Canada, Czech Republic, and third countries with mutual agreements).
- However, **if total duration is less than one year**, and **no benefit exists under the legislation**, the competent institution **does not have to pay** a benefit under this Agreement.

> ❌ A key safeguard to prevent overpayment or eligibility based on minimal contributions.

### 🔹 **6. Benefit Calculation and Payment Rules**

#### ✅ For OAS and Allowances (Outside Canada):
- A person outside Canada **must have totalized residence periods equal to or exceeding** the minimum required by Canadian OAS law to qualify for a pension.
- An **allowance or Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)** is paid **only to the extent permitted** by Canadian law.

#### ✅ For People Eligible via Totalization:
- **Earnings-related portion** of the benefit is calculated **based only on CPP pensionable earnings**.
- **Flat-rate portion** is calculated by:
  - Multiplying the flat-rate amount under CPP
  - By the **ratio of actual CPP contributions to the minimum qualifying period**.
  - **Maximum ratio = 1** (i.e., no more than full benefit).

> 📌 Example: If a person contributed for 60% of the required period, they receive 60% of the flat-rate portion.

#### ✅ For Czech Republic Benefits:
- If eligibility is met **without using totalization**, the benefit is calculated **solely on Czech legislation**.
- If eligibility **depends on totalization**, the Czech institution:
  1. Calculates the **theoretical benefit** if all periods were under Czech law alone.
  2. Applies a **ratio** of Czech creditable periods to totalized periods to determine the actual benefit.

> 🔍 This ensures fair and proportional outcomes.

#### ✅ Assessment Base:
- Creditable periods under **Canadian legislation are excluded** when calculating the assessment base for Czech benefits.

> ⚖️ Ensures no double-counting or overvaluation.

### 🔹 **7. Special Provisions on Overlapping Benefits**

- The Czech Republic’s rules regarding **reduction, suspension, or cancellation** of benefits due to:
  - Overlapping with other benefits
  - Other income
  - Gainful employment  
  **Apply to persons receiving benefits from Canada** or earning income/working outside the Czech Republic.

> ⚠️ **Exception**: Overlapping benefits of the **same kind** (e.g., old age, invalidity, survivorship) granted by **both Parties** are **not subject** to these reductions.

> ✅ This protects against double-dipping and ensures consistency in benefit management.

#### ✅ Waiver Power
