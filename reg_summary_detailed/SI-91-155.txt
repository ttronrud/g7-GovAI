Certainly. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulatory Summary: Revocation of Disposal Rights in the Yukon Territory (Order in Council P.C. 1991-1048 and SI/91-88)**

#### **1. Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which empowers the federal government to withdraw certain lands from disposal for specific public purposes.
- The primary justification for the withdrawal is to **facilitate the settlement of Indigenous (Native) land claims**.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
- To **withdraw specific parcels of land** from being available for disposal (i.e., sale, lease, or other forms of development) in the **Yukon Territory**.
- The withdrawal is temporary and specifically intended to provide a **legal and administrative framework** to support the resolution of native land claims — a key component of Canada’s ongoing reconciliation and Indigenous rights processes.

#### **3. Scope of the Withheld Lands**
- The lands described in the **schedule attached to the Order** are withdrawn from disposal under the **Territorial Lands Act**.
- This includes:
  - All **mines and minerals**, regardless of type:
    - Solid (e.g., quartz, gold, copper)
    - Liquid (e.g., oil, water)
    - Gaseous (e.g., natural gas)
  - **Exclusions**:
    - **Sand and gravel**: May still be disposed of under the **Territorial Quarrying Regulations**.
    - **Forest resources**: May be disposed of under the **Yukon Timber Regulations**.
- The withdrawal applies to all surface and subsurface rights, except as specifically excluded.

#### **4. Duration of the Withdrawal**
- The withdrawal is **temporary**, effective from the date of the Order until **December 31, 1993**.
- This time-bound nature allows for the orderly progression of land claim negotiations and settlements, with the expectation that the lands may later be returned to disposal or reclassified based on developments in land claim processes.

#### **5. Exceptions and Protected Rights**
Despite the withdrawal, the following rights and interests are **not affected** and remain in force:
- **Recorded mineral claims** in good standing under:
  - The **Yukon Quartz Mining Act**
  - The **Yukon Placer Mining Act**
- **Existing oil and gas rights, interests, and privileges** under the **Canada Petroleum Resources Act**.
- **Surface rights in good standing** granted under **Section 8 of the Territorial Lands Act**.

> This ensures that existing legal rights held by individuals or companies are preserved and not extinguished by the withdrawal.

#### **6. Specific Land Designations**
The withdrawal applies to parcels of land categorized as:
- **"COMMUNITY LANDS"**
- **"RURAL LANDS"**
- **"AREAS FOR SITE SPECIFIC SELECTION"**

These land designations are identified on **official maps** held at:
- The **Federal Claims Office**, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, in **Whitehorse, Yukon Territory**.
- Copies of these maps have been **deposited with**:
  - The **Supervisor of Lands** at Whitehorse
  - The **Mining Recorders** at:
    - Whitehorse
    - Watson Lake
    - Mayo
    - Dawson

This ensures transparency, accessibility, and legal record-keeping for stakeholders.

#### **7. Saving, Excluding, and Reserving Provisions**
- The Order **explicitly saves, excludes, and reserves** any tract of territorial land that:
  - Is already subject to a **lease or agreement for sale** under the **Territorial Lands Act** or **Territorial Lands Regulations**.
- This means that if a parcel is already under a lease or sale agreement, it is **not included in the withdrawal**, and such agreements remain valid and enforceable.

#### **8. Strategic and Policy Implications**
- The regulation reflects a **policy shift toward Indigenous self-determination and land rights**.
- By setting aside lands for claim settlement, the federal government acknowledges the historical and ongoing relationship between Indigenous peoples and the land.
- It supports the **implementation of land claim agreements** negotiated between the Government of Canada and First Nations, particularly in the Yukon Territory.
- The temporary nature of the withdrawal allows for flexibility and ensures that land use planning and economic development are not permanently disrupted.

### **Conclusion**
This Order in Council is a **temporary, targeted withdrawal** of mineral and surface rights from disposal in the Yukon Territory, specifically to support the **settlement of Indigenous land claims**. It is carefully structured to:
- Protect existing legal rights (mineral claims, oil/gas rights, surface rights),
- Exclude certain resources (sand/gravel, forests) that are governed by separate regulatory regimes,
- Maintain legal clarity through clear map references and designated land categories,
- Respect existing leases and agreements.

It represents a significant step in Canada’s broader effort to **recognize, respect, and implement Indigenous land rights** within the framework of federal land policy and legislation.
