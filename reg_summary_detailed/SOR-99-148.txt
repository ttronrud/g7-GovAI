### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulatory order grants a **remission (i.e., cancellation or waiver)** of anti-dumping duties that were previously imposed on a specific import of automotive galvannealed coil steel. The remission applies to a single shipment made by **Krupp Fabco Co.** on **June 5, 1998**, and is limited to a specific product specification and quantity.

### **Key Details of the Remission**

1. **Import Details:**
   - **Importer:** Krupp Fabco Co.
   - **Date of Import:** June 5, 1998
   - **Quantity:** 22,446 kilograms
   - **Product Description:** Automotive galvannealed coil steel
   - **Specification:** MS6000 DDQ AK IF .065 MIN x 54.100  
     *(This is a technical specification indicating the steel’s grade, coating, thickness, and dimensions, ensuring it meets automotive manufacturing standards.)*

2. **Duty in Question:**  
   Anti-dumping duties imposed under the **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**, which are typically levied when a foreign product is sold in Canada at less than fair value, potentially harming domestic industry.

3. **Nature of the Remission:**  
   The regulation formally **waives or remits** the anti-dumping duties that were originally collected or are due on this specific shipment. This means the importer is not required to pay those duties, effectively reducing the financial burden on this particular transaction.

### **Conditions for the Remission to Be Effective**

The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to two key conditions:

1. **Timely Claim to the Minister of National Revenue:**  
   Krupp Fabco Co. must submit a formal claim for remission to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date the Order comes into force.  
   - This establishes a strict deadline to ensure accountability and timely administrative processing.

2. **Submission of Required Evidence:**  
   Krupp Fabco Co. must provide **evidence to the Minister of National Revenue** that the steel in question:
   - Is indeed **automotive galvannealed coil steel**; and  
   - Meets the **exact specification** of **MS6000 DDQ AK IF .065 MIN x 54.100**.  
   - This requirement ensures that the remission is only granted for shipments that match the defined product criteria, preventing misuse or expansion beyond the intended scope.

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate government authority (typically the Clerk of the Privy Council or the Canada Gazette). This is the official date when the remission becomes legally binding and enforceable.

---

### **Legal and Policy Context**

- **Purpose of the Remission:**  
  This type of remission may be used to correct an error in the original anti-dumping determination, respond to a change in market conditions, or address a specific case where the imposition of duties was deemed inappropriate or unjustified. It reflects a discretionary power under Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act to adjust duties in specific circumstances.

- **Administrative Oversight:**  
  The requirement for evidence and a time-bound claim ensures that the remission is not applied arbitrarily and maintains transparency and accountability in the administration of anti-dumping measures.

- **Scope Limitation:**  
  The remission is **limited to this single shipment** and the specified product specification. It does not extend to other shipments, other products, or other importers.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **targeted, legally grounded remission** of anti-dumping duties on a specific import of automotive galvannealed coil steel. It is a case-specific measure designed to correct or adjust a prior duty assessment, subject to strict procedural requirements to ensure compliance, transparency, and fairness. The conditions ensure that the remission is both justified and properly administered, aligning with broader principles of trade policy and administrative accountability in Canada’s customs regime.
