**Detailed Summary of the CUFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
The *CUFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**.  
- **Primary Statutory Basis**: *Customs Tariff* (S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1))  
- **Reference to Prior Legislation**: S.C. 1997, c. 36 (likely related to the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act or related enabling legislation)

This regulatory instrument implements the **Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA)**, specifically concerning tariff preferences for goods originating in Ukraine.

### **2. Key Definition: "Originating" Goods**
In these regulations, the term **"originating"** means that goods qualify as originating in the territory of a **Party (Canada or Ukraine)** under the **rules of origin** established in **Chapter Three** of the CUFTA — titled *"Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures."*  
- This definition is crucial because only goods that meet the origin requirements are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the agreement.

### **3. Eligibility for Ukraine Tariff Preference (Paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff)**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b)** of the *Customs Tariff*, goods exported from Ukraine are entitled to the **Ukraine Tariff** (i.e., preferential tariff rates) if they meet **one of the following two conditions**:

#### **Condition 1: Direct Shipment to Canada (No Third-Country Transit)**
Goods shipped directly from Ukraine to Canada **without passing through another country** are eligible for preferential treatment if:
- They are transported via a **through bill of lading**, or  
- They are transported **without a through bill of lading**, **provided** that:
  - The importer, upon request by a customs officer, provides **documentary evidence** that clearly shows:
    - The **shipping route**  
    - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to entry into Canada

> *Note*: This condition ensures that even in the absence of a through bill of lading, the origin and movement of goods can be verified through supporting documentation.

#### **Condition 2: Shipment Through a Third Country**
If goods are shipped from Ukraine to Canada **through another country**, the importer must provide:
1. **Documentary evidence** showing:
   - The **shipping route**  
   - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to importation into Canada  
2. A **copy of the customs control documents** that confirm:
   - The goods **remained under customs control** throughout their stay in the third country

> *Purpose of the customs control documents*: To ensure that the goods did not undergo any unauthorized processing, re-export, or changes in origin — which would disqualify them from being considered "originating."

### **4. Effective Date and Implementation Timeline**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 36 of the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 8 of the Statutes of Canada, 2017) comes into force.  
- **However**, if the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This provision provides a clear implementation schedule and ensures that the rules are activated in alignment with the broader legislative framework of CUFTA.

---

### **5. Reference to In-Force Regulations**

- The regulations are **in force as of August 1, 2017**.  
- This date is referenced in **Supplemental Information (SI/2017-37)**, which confirms the official publication and enforcement date.

### **6. Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Promote Trade** | Encourages trade between Canada and Ukraine by reducing tariffs on qualifying goods from Ukraine. |
| **Ensure Origin Verification** | Requires verifiable documentation to prevent fraud or misuse of preferential treatment. |
| **Compliance with Rules of Origin** | Ensures goods are genuinely originating in Ukraine, not re-exported or processed in third countries. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires importers to provide detailed shipping records and customs control documentation when requested. |

### **7. Practical Implications for Importers and Customs Officers**

- **Importers from Ukraine** must maintain and be prepared to provide:
  - Bills of lading (especially through bills)
  - Shipping manifests
  - Transshipment records
  - Customs control documentation (e.g., customs declarations, entry forms)

- **Customs Officers** may request these documents to verify origin and compliance. Failure to provide such evidence may result in the goods being treated as non-originating and subject to higher (non-preferential) tariffs.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *CUFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* establish a clear and enforceable framework for granting **preferential tariff treatment to goods originating in Ukraine** under the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement. By defining the conditions under which goods qualify for the Ukraine Tariff — particularly through direct or third-country shipments — and requiring verifiable documentation, the regulations ensure **fair, transparent, and legitimate trade benefits**. The rules are aligned with Canada’s broader trade policy objectives and are activated in accordance with the official implementation date of the CUFTA Implementation Act.

These regulations are a key component in strengthening economic ties between Canada and Ukraine while maintaining compliance with international trade rules and customs standards.
