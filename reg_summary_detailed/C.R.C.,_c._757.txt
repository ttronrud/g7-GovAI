**Detailed Summary of the Diplomatic (Excise Taxes) Remission Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Diplomatic (Excise Taxes) Remission Order* and may be cited as such. It establishes a specific exemption from excise taxes for certain goods purchased or imported by designated diplomatic personnel.

---

**2. Key Definitions**

- **Minister**: Refers to the Minister of National Revenue of Canada. This is the governing authority responsible for administering excise tax laws and approving remissions under this Order.

- **Representative**: Defined broadly to include:
  - The **head of a diplomatic mission** (e.g., ambassador, High Commissioner) representing a foreign government in Canada.
  - A **counsellor, secretary, attaché, or officer of equal rank** serving at an embassy, legation, or office of a High Commissioner in Canada.
  - A **consul-general, consul, vice-consul, trade commissioner, or assistant trade commissioner** who:
    - Is a **native or citizen** of the country they represent.
    - Is **not engaged in any other business or profession** (i.e., their role is solely diplomatic or consular).

This definition ensures that only individuals with legitimate diplomatic or consular status and no commercial interests are eligible for the remission.

**3. Scope of Excise Tax Remission**

Under this Order, excise taxes are **remitted (exempted)** on the following goods:

- **Cigars, cigarettes, manufactured tobaccos, and wines**:
  - That are **manufactured or produced in Canada**.
  - Purchased by the representative **for personal or official use**.

- **Goods imported into Canada**:
  - By the representative **for personal or official use**.

This means that if a representative buys or imports these items (either domestically produced or imported), they are exempt from excise taxes **provided** the goods are used for personal or official purposes.

---

**4. Conditions for Remission**

A remission is granted **only if**:
- The goods are **not sold or otherwise disposed of** (e.g., resold, transferred, or used commercially) **before they have been in the representative’s personal or official use or possession for one full year**.

This one-year holding period ensures that the goods are genuinely used by the representative and not diverted for profit or resale, thereby preventing abuse of the exemption.

---

**5. Exclusion Based on Reciprocity**

Remission **will not be granted** to a representative of a government where:
- The **Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs** has formally advised the Minister that **full reciprocity is not being provided** by that government to Canadian government offices, officials, or employees.

This clause reflects Canada’s principle of **mutual benefit and reciprocity** in diplomatic relations. It prevents granting tax exemptions to representatives from countries that do not provide similar treatment to Canadian officials, ensuring fairness and equitable treatment in international diplomatic engagements.

---

**6. Application Process**

To claim remission, a representative must:
- Submit an **application on a form acceptable to the Minister of National Revenue**.
- The application must be **approved in the name of the head of the mission, consul post, or trade commissioner’s office**, depending on the representative’s level and position.

This ensures accountability and centralized approval, with the head of the mission or office acting as the official authority responsible for the application.

---

**Purpose and Policy Rationale**

The Order aims to:
- Support diplomatic and consular personnel by allowing them to access essential goods (such as tobacco and wine) without incurring excise taxes.
- Promote fairness in international relations through the principle of reciprocity.
- Prevent misuse of the exemption by requiring a one-year use or possession period before resale.
- Ensure that tax exemptions are granted only to legitimate diplomatic or consular representatives, not to individuals with commercial interests.

---

**Limitations and Key Restrictions**

- **No commercial activity**: Representatives must not engage in any business or professional activity outside their diplomatic or consular role.
- **One-year possession requirement**: Goods must be used or held for at least one year before they can be sold or disposed of.
- **Reciprocity check**: Governments must provide equivalent treatment to Canadian officials; otherwise, exemptions are denied.
- **Eligibility limited to nationals**: Only citizens or natives of the country represented are eligible.

---

**Conclusion**

The *Diplomatic (Excise Taxes) Remission Order* provides a structured, equitable, and conditionally granted exemption from excise taxes for Canadian diplomatic and consular officials. It balances the practical needs of foreign representatives with fiscal responsibility and international reciprocity. By requiring personal or official use and a one-year holding period, the Order ensures that tax benefits are not exploited for commercial gain. It also reinforces Canada’s diplomatic norms through its reciprocity clause, maintaining consistency in international tax and diplomatic practices.
