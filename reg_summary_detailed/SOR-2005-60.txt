**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Direction to the CRTC (Reservation of Channels for the Distribution of CPAC)**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation, issued under the *Broadcasting Act* and implemented by the Government of Canada, reaffirms and strengthens Canada’s commitment to linguistic duality — the principle that both English and French are official languages of Canada. It is rooted in the Government’s broader policy of ensuring equitable access to public information and civic engagement across both official language communities.

On **March 12, 2003**, the Government released a new **Official Languages Accountability and Coordination Framework**, which renewed its dedication to supporting Canada’s bilingual character. A key element of this framework involves the accessibility and availability of public affairs programming in both official languages.

The **Canadian Public Affairs Channel (CPAC)** is recognized as a vital and unique component of Canada’s broadcasting system. It provides public interest programming focused on civic education, political discourse, and public service issues — content that is essential for informed citizenship.

The **Standing Committee on Official Languages** and the **Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage** have jointly recommended that CPAC be made more widely available in both English and French. This regulation implements that recommendation by mandating the distribution of CPAC in both official languages through cable services.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Mandate for Cable Distribution Undertakings**  
   The **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** is directed to require all **cable broadcasting distribution undertakings** that meet certain criteria to reserve two video channels for the distribution of CPAC.

2. **Eligibility Criteria**  
   The requirement applies specifically to:
   - Cable distribution undertakings with **2,000 or more subscribers**, regardless of whether they are licensed or exempted from licensing by the CRTC.
   - This excludes smaller cable providers with fewer than 2,000 subscribers, who may face significant financial or competitive burdens if required to carry CPAC in both languages.

3. **Channel Allocation Requirements**  
   Each qualifying cable provider must reserve:
   - **One channel** for the **English-language service** of CPAC.
   - **One channel** for the **French-language service** of CPAC.

4. **Basic Service Requirement**  
   At least **one of the two reserved channels must be on the basic service** (i.e., the foundational tier of service offered to all subscribers at no extra cost). This ensures that CPAC is accessible to the broadest possible audience, including those who do not pay for premium channels.

5. **Scope of the Service**  
   The channels must carry the **licensed and exempted programming service** provided by CPAC — meaning the content must be officially authorized and recognized as public affairs programming.

### **Legal Basis**

The regulation is authorized under:
- **Paragraph 26(1)(b) of the Broadcasting Act**, which empowers the Minister of Canadian Heritage to make directions to the CRTC to promote the objectives of the Act, particularly in relation to official languages.
- The **consultation requirement** under **subsection 26(4)** of the Broadcasting Act, which mandates that the Minister consult with the CRTC before issuing such directions.

This ensures that the decision is made through a formal, transparent, and collaborative process between the federal government and the regulatory body responsible for broadcasting.

### **Purpose and Objectives**

- **Promote Linguistic Equity**: Ensure that both English and French-speaking Canadians have equal access to public affairs programming.
- **Support Civic Engagement**: Provide Canadians with reliable, non-partisan information on government, politics, and public policy.
- **Strengthen Canada’s Official Languages Policy**: Demonstrate the government’s commitment to linguistic duality in broadcasting.
- **Ensure Accessibility**: By requiring one channel to be on the basic service, the regulation ensures that CPAC is available to all subscribers without additional cost.

---

### **Exemptions and Considerations**

- **Small cable providers (under 2,000 subscribers)** are **not required** to carry CPAC in both languages. This exemption recognizes that smaller operators may lack the financial resources or market viability to carry such a service without significant cost or competitive disadvantage.
- The regulation does **not apply to satellite or other forms of distribution** unless explicitly covered by other legislation or CRTC orders.
- The requirement is **not retroactive** — it applies to providers who meet the subscriber threshold and are currently operating under CRTC licensing or exemption.

---

### **Effective Date**

The regulation comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette*, ensuring timely implementation while allowing for administrative preparation by cable providers and the CRTC.

---

### **Significance and Impact**

- This regulation is a concrete step toward fulfilling Canada’s official languages obligations in the media sector.
- It enhances public access to democratic processes and promotes transparency in government.
- It supports the role of CPAC as a public service broadcaster, ensuring that civic information is available in both official languages, especially in regions where language access is critical.
- It balances the need for linguistic equity with practical considerations for smaller broadcasters.

### **Legal Citation**

S.C. 1991, c. 11 (a reference to the *Statutes of Canada*, 1991, Chapter 11 — the *Broadcasting Act*), which provides the legal foundation for the regulation.

### **Conclusion**

This Direction to the CRTC establishes a clear, enforceable mechanism to ensure that the Canadian Public Affairs Channel (CPAC) is widely available in both English and French through cable services. By requiring providers with 2,000 or more subscribers to reserve dedicated channels — with at least one on the basic service — the regulation promotes linguistic inclusivity, strengthens democratic participation, and upholds Canada’s official languages policy in the broadcasting sector. While recognizing the financial challenges faced by smaller providers, it maintains a balanced approach that supports both public interest and market realities.
