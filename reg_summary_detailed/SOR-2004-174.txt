## 📝 **Detailed Summary of the Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations**

### 🔹 **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the *Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985* (PBSA):

- **Subsection 2(1)** – Definition of "surplus"
- **Subsection 9(1)** – Definition of solvency deficiency
- **Paragraph 10.1(2)(b)(b)** – Solvency ratio requirements
- **Section 39c** – Funding of solvency deficiencies

The primary objective is to **fund solvency deficiencies** in the **Air Canada Pension Plan (Air Canada Pension Plan or "plan")** — a defined benefit pension plan administered by Air Canada — that emerged as of **January 1, 2004**, and to establish a structured, transparent, and legally compliant method for funding these deficiencies.

---

### 🔹 **2. Scope of Application**
- Applies **only to Air Canada pension plans** established **before January 1, 2004**.
- The plan must be administered by Air Canada.
- These regulations are **not applicable to other pension plans** or to plans established after January 1, 2004, unless a new deficiency arises post-2004.

---

### 🔹 **3. Key Definitions**

### 🔹 **4. Conditions for Funding a Solvency Deficiency**
To fund a solvency deficiency (initial or subsequent), the following documents must be filed with the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)** **not later than the day the initial order expires**:

1. **Actuarial Report**  
   – Values the plan as of **January 1, 2004**.

2. **Statement by Air Canada**  
   – Confirming that **beneficiary representatives** have consented to funding the deficiency under these regulations.

3. **Certified Board Resolution**  
   – From Air Canada’s board of directors, agreeing to fund the deficiency under these regulations.

4. **Copy of Promissory Note**  
   – Issued under the Protocol (Section 4 of the Protocol).

5. **Copy of Security Agreement**  
   – Referenced in paragraph 5(b) of the Protocol.

6. **Confirmation of Contributions**  
   – That **normal cost contributions** and any **special payments** (as per Protocol paragraph 11(c)) have been remitted to the pension fund **on or before the regulations come into force**.

---

### 🔹 **5. Exemptions from Certain PBSA Provisions**
If the required information is filed, the plan is **exempt from subsections 8(1) and (8)(2)** of the PBSA for the following:

- Any **special payments, employer contributions, or other amounts** accrued or due **before January 1, 2004**.
- The **principal outstanding amount** of the promissory note (under Section 4 of the Protocol) if it becomes due and payable due to an **event of default**.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The plan is **not exempt** from subsections 8(1) and (2) for any special payments, contributions, or amounts that arise **under these regulations**.

---

### 🔹 **6. Application of Section 9 of the PBSA**
- **Section 9** of the PBSA (which governs solvency standards) applies to the plan **except as otherwise provided in these regulations**.
- For the purpose of calculating solvency deficiency:
  - **Paragraph (a)**: The value of assets is based on **market value**.
  - **Paragraph (d)**: The present value of **special payments made before January 1, 2004**, and of **special payments required to cover an initial unfunded liability as of January 1, 2004**, is **zero**.
  - **New additions to paragraph (d)**:
    - The present value of any special payment required under **Sections 9 or 13** of these regulations.
    - The present value of any special payment required during the period **January 2, 2004 – December 31, 2013** for an initial unfunded liability emerging **after January 1, 2004**.

> This means that **future special payments under these regulations are counted in solvency deficiency calculations**.

---

### 🔹 **7. Exemption from Subsection 9(7.1)**
- **Subsection 9(7.1)** of the PBSA (which normally applies to special payments) **does not apply** to plans funded under these regulations.
- This provides **flexibility** in how special payments are treated for solvency compliance.

---

### 🔹 **8. Calculation of Initial Solvency Deficiency**
- The initial solvency deficiency is calculated **as if** the special payments under **paragraph 11(c) of the Protocol** had been **remitted on December 31, 2003**.
- This adjustment ensures that the deficiency reflects a more realistic scenario, avoiding a timing mismatch.

> The **solvency ratio** as of January 1, 2004 is then calculated **after** this adjusted deficiency is determined.

---

### 🔹 **9. Funding Schedule and Annual Special Payments**
- The initial solvency deficiency must be funded over a **10-year period**, from the **2004 plan year to the 2013 plan year**.
- Each year, a **special payment** is required to be made to the pension fund.
- The **amount** of each annual special payment is determined as follows:

#### Formula:
> **Annual Special Payment** =  
> (Adjusted Aggregate Amount for the Plan Year) ×  
> (Initial Solvency Deficiency of the Plan / Aggregate Initial Solvency Deficiencies of All Plans)

---

#### What is the "Adjusted Aggregate Amount"?
- Based on the **unadjusted aggregate amount** (from a schedule) multiplied by:
  - **One**, or
  - The **ratio of total initial solvency deficiencies** of all plans to the **sum of the present values** (as of Jan 1, 2004) of each unadjusted aggregate amount.

> This ensures that plans with larger initial deficits are not disproportionately burdened.

---

#### Special Adjustment Rule (2004 Plan Year Only)
- If the adjusted aggregate amount for **2004** is **less than** the result of:
  > (Assumed interest rate used in liability valuation) × (Total initial solvency deficiencies),
  
  then:
  - The **2004 adjusted amount** is set to that result.
  - The **adjusted amounts for 2006, 2007, and 2008** are **reduced by the same amount** to maintain the **same total present value** of payments as if the adjustment had not been made.

> This prevents overfunding in early years and ensures consistency in long-term financial impact.

---

### 🔹 **10. Payment Schedule and Timelines**
- Air Canada must submit a **payment schedule** to the Superintendent **within 14 days** after the **expiration of the initial order**.
- The schedule must show the **annual special payment** for each of the 10 years (2004–2013).

---

### 🔹 **11. Payment of 2004 Annual Special Payment (Two Installments)**
- The 2004 payment is split into two installments:
  - **First installment (75%)**: Due by the **later of**
    - October 30, 2004, or
    - 30 days after the regulations come into force.
  - **Second installment (25%)**: Due by **January 30, 2005**.

> This phased payment allows for better financial planning and compliance.
