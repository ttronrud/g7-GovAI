### **Overview**

The *Tobacco Charges Regulations* are a set of administrative rules made under **subsection 42.1(1)a of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA)**. These regulations establish a system by which **designated manufacturers of tobacco products in Canada** are required to pay an **annual charge** to the federal government.

The regulations were issued on **March 3, 2025**, and come into force on **May 1, 2025**, with certain provisions (specifically Section 9) taking effect on **April 1, 2028**.

### **4. Response to Requests for Clarification**

- A designated manufacturer must provide **any necessary information** to clarify the statement **within 10 days** of a request from the Minister.

---

### **5. Estimation of Net Sales Revenue**

If:
- A statement is **not submitted**, or
- The Minister has **reasonable grounds** to believe the information is **incorrect or incomplete**,

The Minister may **estimate** the manufacturer’s net sales revenue using available data.

> **Note**: Any reference to "total net sales revenue" in the regulations when an estimate is used will be interpreted as referring to the **estimated** revenue.

---

### **6. Calculation of the Annual Charge**

The annual charge is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Annual Charge} = \left( \frac{\text{Manufacturer's Net Sales Revenue}}{\text{Aggregate Net Sales Revenue of All Designated Manufacturers}} \right) \times \text{Annual Cost Base}
\]

Where:
- **Manufacturer's Net Sales Revenue** = Revenue from sales in the prior fiscal year.
- **Aggregate Net Sales Revenue** = Sum of all designated manufacturers’ net sales revenue.
- **Annual Cost Base** = Total government costs incurred during that fiscal year for TVPA operations.

#### Special Provisions for Corrections:

- If the Minister becomes aware that a manufacturer **was not previously charged** but should have been:
  - The Minister must calculate the charge using the formula above.

- If new information leads the Minister to believe a prior charge was **inaccurate**:
  - Recalculate the charge using the new data.
  - **Subtract** the previously calculated charge from the new one.
  - **Only applies if less than 7 years have passed** since November 30 of the fiscal year to which the new information relates.

> This ensures that corrections are not retroactively applied after a long period.

---

### **7. Payment of the Annual Charge**

A designated manufacturer must pay the annual charge **no later than November 30** of each fiscal year, under the following conditions:

#### Case A: Payment Required (when sales revenue meets threshold)
- If the manufacturer’s net sales revenue was **at least 0.001%** of the total aggregate net sales revenue of all manufacturers:
  - Pay the **calculated annual charge**.

#### Case B: Recalculated Charge (after correction)
- If the charge was **recalculated** (due to new information):
  - **If the previous charge was higher**:
    - Pay the **positive difference** (new minus old) **only if** the manufacturer’s sales were ≥0.001% of total.
  - **If the previous charge was lower**:
    - Pay the **new recalculated charge** **even if** previous sales were <0.001%, **provided** the new sales are ≥0.001%.

> This ensures that manufacturers with minimal sales are not unfairly burdened unless they now meet the threshold.

#### Case C: Refund (Negative Amount)

- If the **subtraction under correction results in a negative amount** (i.e., the recalculated charge is lower than the old one):
  - The Minister must **credit** that negative amount to the manufacturer’s account **by November 30** of the fiscal year.

> This acts as a **refund mechanism** for overpayments due to corrections.
