**Detailed Summary of the *American Consumption of Softwood Lumber Products Regulations* (S.C. 2006, c. 13)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendations of the **Minister for International Trade** and the **Minister of National Revenue**, under specific provisions of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006* (the "Act"). The legal authority stems from:

- **Subsections 14(3) and (4)** of the Act – which relate to the calculation of expected American consumption of softwood lumber products.
- **Paragraph 100(1)(b)** of the Act – concerning the determination of market shares.
- **Section 107** of the Act – which authorizes the establishment of regulations to define and calculate American consumption of softwood lumber products.

This regulation provides a detailed method for calculating **American consumption of softwood lumber**, which is used to assess the impact of Canadian softwood lumber exports on U.S. markets and to determine export charges under the broader softwood lumber agreement framework.

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

#### **"Act"**
- Refers to the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006*.

#### **Key Terms with Defined Meanings**
- **American softwood lumber exports**: Amount of softwood lumber exported by the United States.
- **American softwood lumber imports from countries other than Canada**: Softwood lumber imported into the U.S. from non-Canadian sources.
- **Canadian softwood lumber exports**: Softwood lumber exported by Canada to the United States.

> These terms are defined **in accordance with Paragraph 1 of Annex 7D of the Softwood Lumber Agreement**, as interpreted under **subsection 2(1) of the Export and Import Permits Act**.  
> The definitions may be **amended or clarified by the parties** (Canada and the U.S.) or through **arbitral awards** arising from disputes.

---

### **3. Data Sources**

The calculations in these regulations rely on data from three authoritative sources:

| Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Statistics Canada** | Provides data on **Canadian softwood lumber exports to the United States**. |
| **U.S. Census Bureau** | Supplies data on **American softwood lumber exports** and **American softwood lumber imports from countries other than Canada**. |
| **Western Wood Products Association (WWPA)** – Monthly publication *Lumber Track* | Provides data on **American shipments of softwood lumber** (by region). |

> These data sources ensure that the calculations are based on reliable, publicly available, and internationally recognized statistics.

### **4. Core Calculation: American Consumption of Softwood Lumber**

The **American consumption of softwood lumber** is defined as the sum of three components:

$$
\text{American Consumption} = \text{Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S.} + \text{American softwood lumber imports from non-Canada} + \text{Net American shipments of softwood lumber}
$$

This formula captures all forms of softwood lumber usage in the U.S. market — whether produced domestically, imported from outside Canada, or shipped domestically (net of exports).

---

### **5. Net American Shipments of Softwood Lumber**

This component represents the **domestic movement** of softwood lumber within the United States, net of exports. It is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Net American Shipments} = \text{Total American Shipments (by region)} - \text{American softwood lumber exports from those regions}
$$

#### Breakdown of Total American Shipments:
- **Western Region**: Includes Coast, Inland, and California Redwood.
- **Southern Region**
- **Northern Region**: Calculated as **6.25% of the sum of Western and Southern region shipments**.

> This regional weighting reflects historical patterns in softwood lumber production and distribution in the U.S., with the Northern region being a smaller but significant market.

#### Example:
If Western shipments = 100 units and Southern shipments = 80 units:
- Sum = 180 units
- Northern shipments = 180 × 6.25% = 11.25 units
- Total American shipments = 100 + 80 + 11.25 = 191.25 units

Then subtract American exports from these regions to get net shipments.

---

### **6. Expected Monthly American Consumption (for Subsections 14(3) and (4))**

This is used to forecast monthly consumption and assess the expected demand in the U.S. market.

$$
\text{Expected Monthly Consumption} = \left( \frac{\text{Annual American Consumption over 12 months ending 3 months before the current month}}{12} \right) \times \text{Seasonal Adjustment Factor}
$$

#### Components:
- **12-month period**: The average consumption over the 12 months ending **3 months prior** to the month in question.
- **Seasonal adjustment factor**: A multiplier derived from historical seasonal trends (e.g., higher consumption in spring/summer).  
  → These factors are **set out in a schedule** attached to the regulations.

> Example: To calculate expected consumption for March 2025:
> - Use the 12-month average from October 2024 to February 2025.
> - Apply the seasonal adjustment factor for March.

This ensures that fluctuations due to seasonality (e.g., construction season) are properly accounted for in export charge assessments.

---

### **7. Market Shares (for Paragraphs 40(1)(a), (b), and (c) of the Act)**

These formulas determine the **proportions** of American consumption attributable to different sources:

#### (a) **Share from Imports Not Originating in Canada**
$$
\text{Share from Non-Canadian Imports} = \frac{\text{American softwood lumber imports from countries other than Canada}}{\text{American consumption of softwood lumber}}
$$

> This measures the percentage of U.S. softwood demand that comes from non-Canadian sources (e.g., Russia, Mexico, or other countries).

#### (b) **Canadian Market Share**
$$
\text{Canadian Market Share} = \frac{\text{Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S.}}{\text{American consumption of softwood lumber}}
$$

> This shows how much of U.S. softwood consumption is directly supplied by Canada.

#### (c) **American Market Share**
$$
\text{American Market Share} = \frac{\text{Net American shipments of softwood lumber}}{\text{American consumption of softwood lumber}}
$$

> This reflects the portion of U.S. consumption that results from domestic production and movement (i.e., not exported or imported from abroad).

> These market shares are used to assess the **impact of Canadian exports** on the U.S. market and to determine whether Canadian exports are displacing domestic or foreign supply.

### **8. Effective Date**

These regulations **came into force on October 12, 2006**.

---

### **Purpose and Context**

These regulations are a **key component of the softwood lumber agreement** between Canada and the United States. Their primary objectives are:

1. **To establish a transparent, data-driven method** for measuring U.S. consumption of softwood lumber.
2. **To ensure fair and accurate assessment** of Canadian softwood exports, particularly in relation to market share and competition with foreign suppliers.
3. **To support the export charge mechanism** under the Act, which may apply when Canadian exports are found to be displacing U.S. domestic production or foreign imports.
4. **To provide a consistent and defensible framework** for dispute resolution and arbitration, especially in cases where market shares are challenged.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Export Charges**: The market shares calculated here can influence whether Canada is subject to export charges under the Act — particularly if Canadian exports exceed a certain threshold of the U.S. market (e.g., when Canadian exports dominate a significant share of American consumption).
- **Market Transparency**: The use of standardized formulas and data sources enhances transparency and reduces the potential for disputes.
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Recognizing seasonal trends ensures that export charges are not applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, especially during peak construction seasons.
- **Regional Weighting**: The 6.25% multiplier for the Northern region reflects historical production patterns and helps maintain accuracy in regional data representation.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *American Consumption of Softwood Lumber Products Regulations* provide a **comprehensive, mathematically precise, and data-backed framework** for measuring and analyzing U.S. softwood lumber consumption. By clearly defining key terms, specifying reliable data sources, and outlining detailed formulas for consumption and market shares, the regulations ensure that decisions regarding export charges and market impacts are both **objective and consistent** with international trade agreements. They remain a critical tool in managing trade relations between Canada and the United States in the softwood lumber sector.
