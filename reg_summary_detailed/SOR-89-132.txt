The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulatory provision was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Regulation 2017-84**, section 1, issued by the Government of Canada.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Number**: SOR/2017-84 (Statutory Instrument 2017-84)
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of that regulation
- **Status**: **Repealed** — meaning the provision no longer exists in force and is no longer applicable or enforceable.
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal became effective upon the publication of SOR/2017-84, which was issued on **April 26, 2017**.

### What Does This Mean?

The repeated mention of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" suggests that a prior regulation (likely a rule or directive) was formally canceled by this instrument. Section 1 of SOR/2017-84 specifically contains the legal language that removes the previous rule from the statute book. This is a standard administrative process used when a regulation is no longer needed, is outdated, or is superseded by a new policy or law.

### Context and Purpose of Repeal:

While the exact content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your query, the repeal of a regulation under SOR/2017-84 typically occurs when:

- The original rule was redundant or no longer relevant.
- A new regulation has been introduced that supersedes its functions.
- There was a need to streamline or simplify the regulatory framework.
- The rule was found to be inconsistent with current legislation or policy objectives.

### Practical Implications:

- Any legal or operational actions based on the repealed regulation are no longer valid.
- Entities (such as businesses, government agencies, or individuals) must now comply with current, active regulations that replace or supersede the repealed one.
- Legal or compliance officers should verify current regulatory requirements to avoid relying on outdated or invalid provisions.

### Conclusion:

The provision referenced in your query — the regulation repealed by SOR/2017-84, section 1 — **no longer exists** and is **not in force**. It was formally canceled as part of a legislative or administrative update to modernize or simplify regulatory requirements. To understand the full context of what was repealed, one would need to consult the original regulation that was removed, which is now unavailable in the current legal database.

> **Note**: Without the original text of the repealed regulation, a detailed summary of its content (e.g., scope, obligations, penalties) cannot be provided. The summary above focuses on the legal status and implications of the repeal, based on the information given.

If you can provide the name or subject matter of the original regulation (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of certain professionals"), I can offer a more specific and detailed analysis.
