**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
Order Respecting the Remission of Anti-Dumping Duties on Certain Hot-Dipped Galvannealed Steel Sheet for Use in the Manufacture of Non-Exposed Motor Vehicle Parts  
**Governing Statute:** *Customs Tariff Act*, R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)  
**Issuing Authority:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance  
**Effective Date:** October 23, 1997

### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation establishes a **remission (i.e., waiver or cancellation)** of anti-dumping duties that have been or will be imposed on specific hot-dipped galvannealed steel sheet imported into Canada. The remission is granted under the authority of *section 101 of the Customs Tariff Act*, and is designed to provide relief to Canadian importers who use this specific type of steel in the production of **non-exposed motor vehicle parts**.

---

### **Scope of the Goods Covered**  
The remission applies to the following specific type of hot-dipped galvannealed steel sheet:

- **Coating weight:** 45/45 g/m² (indicating 45 grams of coating per square meter, with both base and galvanized layers at 45 g/m²)  
- **Thickness:** 1.0 mm  
- **Width:** 101 mm  
- **Form:** Coil  
- **Tensile strength:** Minimum 390 MPa/mm² (high-tensile steel)  
- **Minimum elongation:** 40% (indicating ductility and formability)  

This steel is used specifically in the **manufacture of non-exposed motor vehicle parts** — meaning parts that are not directly exposed to the external environment (e.g., interior components, structural parts not in direct contact with air, moisture, or road conditions).

### **Conditions for Remission**  
Remission is granted **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Import Date Requirement:**  
   The steel sheet must be imported into Canada **on or after July 1, 1997**.  
   → This ensures the benefit applies only to imports made after a defined starting point, likely to align with the timing of the anti-dumping duty imposition and to allow for market adjustment.

2. **Timely Claim Submission:**  
   The importer must file a **claim for remission with the Minister of National Revenue within two years** of the date this Order comes into force.  
   → The Order takes effect on **October 23, 1997**, so the deadline for filing a claim is **October 23, 1999**.  
   → This creates a strict but reasonable timeframe to ensure administrative feasibility and timely resolution.

3. **Evidence of Use in Motor Vehicle Parts Manufacturing:**  
   The importer must provide **sufficient evidence** to the Minister of National Revenue that:  
   - The steel has been **used in the manufacture** of motor vehicle parts, or  
   - It is **intended to be used** in the manufacture of such parts.  
   → The evidence must demonstrate that the steel is being or will be used in **non-exposed motor vehicle components**.  
   → This condition ensures that the remission is not broadly applicable and is targeted to legitimate industrial use in the automotive sector.

### **Legal Basis**  
- The Order is made under **section 101 of the Customs Tariff Act**, which authorizes the Governor in Council (on ministerial recommendation) to make orders for the remission of duties, including anti-dumping duties, in specific circumstances.  
- The remission is conditional and subject to the provisions of **sections 2 and 3** of the Customs Tariff Act, which likely govern the general rules of duty remission, including procedural requirements and limitations.

---

### **Key Implications and Objectives**  
- **Supports Canadian Industry:** By reducing or eliminating anti-dumping duties on a specific steel product used in motor vehicle manufacturing, the regulation supports the competitiveness of Canadian manufacturers in the automotive sector.  
- **Promotes Economic Efficiency:** It allows Canadian companies to access cost-effective raw materials without the burden of anti-dumping duties, which may otherwise increase production costs.  
- **Targeted and Specific:** The regulation is narrowly focused on a defined product specification and use case, minimizing the risk of abuse or unintended benefits.  
- **Ensures Accountability:** The requirement for evidence of use ensures that remission is not granted indiscriminately and that it serves a genuine economic purpose.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This Order is a targeted, time-bound, and conditionally structured remission of anti-dumping duties on a specific type of hot-dipped galvannealed steel sheet. It aims to support the Canadian automotive manufacturing industry by reducing costs for producers of non-exposed motor vehicle parts, while maintaining regulatory oversight through strict eligibility criteria. The regulation reflects a balance between economic support and administrative accountability, consistent with the principles of the Canadian Customs Tariff Act.

**Final Note:** This Order is no longer in force as of the date of its expiry or replacement (not specified in the text), and would be subject to review or repeal if new trade policies or market conditions arise.
