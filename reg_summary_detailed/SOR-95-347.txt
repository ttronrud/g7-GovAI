### **Detailed Summary of the Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Publication**
These regulations were enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada, specifically:
- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in a local newspaper (in this case, *News of the North*) to provide public notice and a reasonable opportunity for comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt proposed regulations after public consultation.

The proposed regulations were published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I** on **February 18 and 25, 1995**, and in **two successive issues of the News of the North** on **February 20 and 27, 1995**. This ensured transparency and allowed interested parties (e.g., landowners, developers, local communities) to submit written representations to the Minister of Transport before final adoption.

#### **2. Official Title and Citation**
- **Title**: *Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1; S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10  
- These regulations are formally known as the **Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Regulations** and establish spatial restrictions on construction near the airport to ensure aviation safety.

#### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several key geographic and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Tuktoyaktuk Airport, located in the vicinity of Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the runway used as a datum for measuring elevations and distances. Located on the centerline of runway 09–27, 702 meters from the displaced threshold of runway 09. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 09–27), designed to ensure safe aircraft approach paths. Each has a gradient of **1:40** (1 meter rise per 40 meters run), rising to a horizontal line 3,000 meters horizontally from the runway end. The horizontal line is 525 meters from the runway centerline and 75 meters above the elevation at the runway end. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (i.e., 2.7 m + 45 m = 47.7 m above sea level)**, extending to the outer boundary of the regulated area. However, if this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground level, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing field associated with runway 09–27. It is **150 meters wide** (75 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,524 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a gradient of **1:7** (1 meter rise per 7 meters run), extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces upward and outward until they intersect with the outer surface. These surfaces ensure a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: 2.7 meters above sea level.

#### **4. Scope of Application**
- The regulations apply to **all land**, including public road allowances, that lies:
  - Adjacent to or
  - In the vicinity of Tuktoyaktuk Airport
- The exact boundaries of this land are defined in **Part VI of the Schedule** to the regulations, which references the **Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3029**, dated **April 14, 1994**.

> **Outer Boundary**: A **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered at the Airport Reference Point (ARP). This defines the maximum area within which the zoning restrictions apply.

---

#### **5. Core Prohibitions**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or build a new structure, or
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object,

**if the highest point of that structure exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the point of location:
1. The **approach surfaces**
2. The **outer surface**
3. The **transitional surfaces**

This means that all structures — whether permanent or temporary — must remain **below** these defined geometric planes to avoid interfering with aircraft operations during takeoff, landing, or approach.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Rationale**
The primary purpose of these zoning regulations is **aviation safety**. By establishing clear, measurable boundaries and elevation limits:
- Aircraft can maintain safe visual and geometric clearance during critical phases of flight (especially during approaches).
- Obstructions such as tall buildings, trees, or structures are prevented from creating hazards that could compromise visibility or flight paths.
- The design of the approach and transition surfaces follows standard aviation safety principles (e.g., 1:40 and 1:7 gradients) to ensure safe descent and landing under various weather and visibility conditions.

---

#### **7. Reference to the Zoning Plan**
All spatial elements (ARP, strips, approach surfaces, outer surface, transitional surfaces, and outer boundary) are derived from and aligned with:
- **Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3029**, dated **April 14, 1994**

This plan serves as the authoritative spatial reference document, ensuring consistency between regulatory language and actual land use planning.

---

#### **8. Key Safety Features**
| Feature | Safety Function |
|--------|------------------|
| **Approach Surfaces (1:40 gradient)** | Ensures aircraft can see the runway and avoid obstacles during final approach. The 3,000-meter reach provides a safe buffer. |
| **Outer Surface (45 m above ARP)** | Provides a consistent ceiling for all structures outside the immediate runway area. Prevents uncontrolled vertical growth. |
| **Transitional Surfaces (1:7 gradient)** | Gradually reduces the height of structures as they move away from the runway, preventing abrupt changes in clearance. |
| **4,000-meter radius boundary** | Defines the maximum area where construction is restricted, protecting the airport from distant interference. |

---

#### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**.
- Violations could result in penalties, including orders to remove or modify structures, or fines, depending on enforcement policy.
- Compliance is monitored through land use planning, development approvals, and aviation safety audits.

### **Conclusion**

The **Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive set of spatial controls designed to protect aviation safety at Tuktoyaktuk Airport. By defining precise elevation limits and geometric boundaries — based on standard aviation safety principles — the regulations prevent the construction of any structure that could interfere with aircraft operations. The rules are grounded in technical accuracy, public consultation, and alignment with the official airport zoning plan, ensuring both safety and responsible land use in a remote Arctic environment.

These regulations exemplify how federal transportation policy integrates engineering standards with community engagement and environmental sensitivity in the development of critical infrastructure in northern Canada.
