**Detailed Summary of the Resident Canadian (Insurance Companies) Regulations**

**Regulatory Context and Authority**  
The *Resident Canadian (Insurance Companies) Regulations* were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under the authority granted by **paragraph (b) of the definition of "resident Canadian" in sections 2 and 703 of the *Insurance Companies Act***. These regulations were enacted on **June 1, 1992**, and are formally cited as the *Resident Canadian (Insurance Companies) Regulations* (S.C. 1991, c. 47).

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **identify specific classes of Canadian citizens who are considered "resident Canadians" for purposes of the Insurance Companies Act**, even though they are not ordinarily residing in Canada. This is particularly important for determining tax and regulatory obligations related to insurance companies, such as reporting, capital requirements, and compliance with Canadian insurance laws.

### **Key Provision: Who is Considered a "Resident Canadian" under Paragraph (b)?**

Under paragraph (b) of the definition of "resident Canadian" in the *Insurance Companies Act*, the following **classes of persons** are explicitly recognized as resident Canadians, despite not being ordinarily resident in Canada:

---

#### **Class 1: Canadian Citizens Not Ordinarily Resident in Canada – Full-Time Employees of a Body Corporate with Majority Canadian Ownership or Control**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Is **not ordinarily resident in Canada**, and
- Is a **full-time employee** of a body corporate (a corporation) that meets **one of the following conditions**:

1. **Ownership or Control by Resident Canadians**:
   - More than 50% of the **voting shares** are **beneficially owned** by resident Canadians described in **paragraph (a) or (c)** of the definition of "resident Canadian" (i.e., Canadian citizens who are ordinarily resident in Canada, or certain other categories of resident Canadians), **or**
   - The body corporate is **controlled or directed** by such resident Canadians.

2. **Majority of Directors are Resident Canadians**:
   - A **majority of the directors** of the body corporate are residents of Canada as defined in paragraph (a) or (c) of the definition.

3. **Subsidiary of a Qualifying Body Corporate**:
   - The body corporate is a **subsidiary** of a body corporate that qualifies under either subparagraph (i) or (ii) above.

> **Key Implication**: Even if a Canadian citizen lives abroad, if they work full-time for a Canadian-owned or Canadian-controlled company (or a subsidiary of such a company), they are considered a "resident Canadian" for insurance regulatory purposes.

#### **Class 2: Canadian Citizens Not Ordinarily Resident in Canada – Full-Time Employees of an International Association or Organization of Which Canada is a Member**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Is **not ordinarily resident in Canada**, and
- Is a **full-time employee** of an **international association or organization** to which **Canada is a member**.

> **Examples**: Employees of the United Nations, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, International Labour Organization (ILO), or other international bodies in which Canada participates.

> **Key Implication**: This recognizes the unique status of Canadian citizens working in international institutions, ensuring they are not treated as non-residents for insurance regulatory purposes.

---

#### **Class 3: Canadian Citizens Who Were Ordinarily Resident in Canada on Their 60th Birthday and Have Resided Outside Canada for Less Than 10 Consecutive Years**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Was **ordinarily resident in Canada on their 60th birthday**, and
- Has **resided outside Canada for less than 10 consecutive years**.

> **Key Implication**: This provision provides a **"reversion" or "return" status** for older Canadian citizens who have lived abroad but have not been away for more than a decade. It acknowledges that long-term residence abroad does not automatically disqualify someone from being considered a resident Canadian under the law.

### **Purpose and Regulatory Significance**

These regulations serve several key functions:

1. **Ensures Regulatory Compliance**: Insurance companies must comply with Canadian regulations regardless of where their employees or directors reside, especially when those individuals are Canadian citizens with strong ties to Canada (e.g., ownership, employment, or heritage).

2. **Supports Tax and Reporting Obligations**: The classification of a person as a "resident Canadian" affects reporting requirements, tax liabilities, and capital adequacy standards under the Insurance Companies Act.

3. **Promotes Consistency and Fairness**: By defining clear criteria, the regulations prevent arbitrary or inconsistent treatment of Canadian citizens living abroad, especially those working for Canadian-owned entities or in international institutions.

4. **Maintains National Interest**: Ensures that Canadian insurance regulators retain oversight over individuals and entities with significant Canadian ownership or connection, even when they are physically located overseas.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The regulations **only apply to Canadian citizens**.
- The status is based on **residence, employment, ownership, or heritage**, not on citizenship alone.
- A person must meet **all the conditions** specified in each class to qualify as a resident Canadian.
- The regulations do **not extend to non-citizens** or individuals who are not Canadian citizens.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**, and remain in force unless amended or repealed.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Resident Canadian (Insurance Companies) Regulations* establish a clear, rule-based framework to determine which Canadian citizens, despite living abroad, are considered "resident Canadians" for regulatory and compliance purposes under the *Insurance Companies Act*. By recognizing full-time employees of Canadian-controlled corporations, members of international organizations, and long-term residents who returned to Canada after a period of absence, the regulations ensure that Canadian insurance law remains effective and equitable in a globalized economy.

These provisions are particularly relevant for cross-border insurance operations, where the residency status of key personnel directly affects regulatory oversight, reporting, and capital requirements.
