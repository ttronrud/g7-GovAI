### **Detailed Summary of the Foreign Ownership of Land Regulations (Alberta)**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Purpose**

The **Foreign Ownership of Land Regulations** (commonly referred to as the *Foreign Ownership of Land Regulations*) were enacted by the **Lieutenant Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Associate Minister of Public Lands and Wildlife**, under a combination of federal and provincial statutes. These regulations were introduced to **restrict foreign ownership and control of agricultural and recreational land in Alberta**, with the primary objective of protecting Canadian interests in land use, ensuring national sovereignty, and promoting equitable access to land for Canadian citizens and permanent residents.

These regulations **repeal the outdated Foreign Ownership of Land (Temporary) Regulations** (O.C. 404/77), which had been in place since 1977, and replace them with a more comprehensive, clearly defined, and operationally specific set of rules.

---

#### **2. Key Legal Authorities and Statutory Basis**

The regulations are grounded in a range of federal and provincial legislation, including:

- **Citizenship Act (Canada)** – Provides the legal basis for defining "ineligible persons" and restricting foreign-controlled interests.
- **Agricultural and Recreational Land Ownership Act (Alberta)** – Establishes the framework for land ownership in agricultural and recreational areas.
- **Companies Act (Alberta)** – Governs corporate structures and ownership.
- **Co-operative Associations Act (Alberta)** and **Credit Union Act (Alberta)** – Address specific types of non-profit and financial institutions.
- **Religious Societies’ Land Act (Alberta)** and **Societies Act (Alberta)** – Cover religious and community-based organizations.

These statutes collectively define who can own land, how ownership is calculated, and under what conditions foreign interests may be permitted.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

Understanding the regulations requires clarity on key definitions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Controlled Land** | Land in Alberta, excluding Crown land, mines, minerals, and land within cities, towns, villages, or summer villages. |
| **Ineligible Person** | Any individual who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident; governments or political subdivisions of foreign countries; or corporations incorporated outside Canada. |
| **Foreign Controlled Corporation** | A corporation that is either: (a) incorporated outside Canada and has ≥50% foreign ownership; or (b) in a chain of corporate succession where a predecessor has >50% foreign ownership; or (c) a public corporation where <2/3 of directors are Canadian citizens or ≥50% of shares are held in blocks of 5% or more by ineligible persons or foreign-controlled entities. |
| **Private Corporation** | A corporation that restricts share transfers, limits membership to 50 or fewer, prohibits public subscription, or restricts member transfers. |
| **Public Corporation** | A corporation not falling under the definition of a private corporation. |
| **Parcel** | A legally defined tract of land with clear boundaries (registered or described in a title), not subdivided except by roads or natural boundaries. |
| **Permanent Resident** | As defined in the Immigration Act (Canada). |
| **Limited Partnership** | A partnership governed by Alberta’s Partnership Act or relevant statutes. |

> **Note:** A foreign-controlled corporation is treated as being "effectively controlled" by non-Canadian citizens or permanent residents for regulatory purposes.

#### **4. Core Prohibition: Restrictions on Foreign Ownership**

> **Section 1 (Main Prohibition):**  
> *No ineligible person or foreign-controlled corporation may take or acquire, directly or indirectly, an interest in controlled land.*

This is the central restriction. It applies to all forms of ownership, including outright purchase, lease, or beneficial interest.

---

#### **5. Exceptions and Permitted Exceptions**

Despite the general ban, several important exceptions allow foreign or ineligible persons to acquire land under strict conditions:

##### **A. Limited Ownership Threshold (2 Parcels, ≤20 Acres)**
- An ineligible person or foreign-controlled corporation may own or beneficially own interests in **no more than two parcels** of controlled land.
- The **total area** of these parcels must not exceed **20 acres**.

##### **B. Tenancy in Common – Calculated Ownership**
- If an ineligible person or foreign-controlled corporation holds a **tenancy in common** interest in a parcel:
  - They are deemed to own an interest equal to:  
    **(Area of parcel) × (Percentage of ownership)**  
    (e.g., 10 acres × 30% = 3 acres of ownership).

##### **C. Limit on Number of Tenants in Common**
- No more than **five ineligible persons or foreign-controlled corporations** may jointly hold a tenancy in common in a single parcel exceeding **20 acres**.

> This prevents the pooling of foreign interests in large tracts.

##### **D. Leases (Term ≤20 Years)**
- An ineligible person or foreign-controlled corporation may lease controlled land for **up to 20 years**.
- The lease must be **registered within 60 days** of execution.
- **No renewal or extension** beyond 20 years is allowed.

##### **E. Options to Purchase**
- An option to buy must:
  - Be exercisable **within one year** of its effective date.
  - Be conditional on the buyer becoming **eligible** under the regulations.
- This ensures that foreign entities cannot use options as a way to circumvent restrictions.

#### **6. Exemptions from the Regulations**

Certain activities and purposes are **exempt** from the general prohibition, including:

| Exemption | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Surface Rights Orders** | Rights granted under the *Surface Rights Act* (e.g., for drilling, mining). |
| **Industrial/Commercial Facilities** | Up to **80 acres** per facility (e.g., processing, manufacturing, transportation). |
| **Energy Infrastructure** | Includes pipelines, processing plants, power plants, transmission lines, refineries, and electric systems. Exemptions apply to projects up to certain acreage limits. |
| **Sand, Gravel, Clay, or Marl Extraction** | Up to **160 acres per project**. |
| **Residential Development** | - Single residence: ≤20 acres<br>- Residential development: ≤80 acres per project<br>Must be in an area where such development is permitted. |
| **Water, Gas, Electric, Telephone Companies** | Pursuant to section 30 of the *Water, Gas, Electric and Telephone Companies Act*. |
| **Diplomatic/Consular Use** | By foreign states. |
| **Estate Transfers** | As executor or administrator of a deceased person’s estate. |
| **Court Orders** | For the benefit of a spouse or child. |
| **Cemetery Plots** | As governed by the *Cemeteries Act*. |

> **Important:** For all exempt purposes, the land must be used **for the stated purpose**, and the holder must **divest themselves of the interest within three years** of:
> - Completion of the purpose,
> - Completion of reclamation,
> - Abandonment of the project,
> - Or if land was over-acquired and not needed, subdivision and divestment of the surplus area.

#### **7. Acquisition of Interests via Legal Transactions**

An ineligible person or foreign-controlled corporation may acquire land through:

- Completion of a **purchase agreement** or **interim agreement**,
- Exercising an **option to purchase**,
- **Foreclosure of a mortgage**, or
- **Specific performance** of a written agreement made **before April 26, 1977**.

> **Deadline:** All such agreements must be **registered in a land titles office by August 1, 1979**.

> **Exception:** If a transfer or caveat (a legal notice) related to a purchase or option is not registered for a parcel of **5,000 acres or more used in a single food/fibre operation**, the regulation does not apply.

---

#### **8. Special Provisions for Trusts and Succession**

- An ineligible person who was **beneficiary of a trust** prior to April 26, 1977, and who previously owned land, may **take over that interest** from the trust under its terms.
- The regulations **do not affect rights under the Dower Act**, meaning spousal or survivorship rights remain intact.

---

#### **9. Corporate Succession and Mergers**

- A **change in ownership or membership** that results in a corporation becoming a foreign-controlled corporation **constitutes a new "acquisition"** of land.
- Similarly, an **amalgamation or merger** involving a corporation that owns land results in the **amalgamated or merged corporation acquiring the interest**.
- In either case, the foreign-controlled corporation must **divest itself of the interest within three years** unless it **ceases to be foreign-controlled for at least 12 consecutive months** during that period.

> This ensures that foreign entities do not gain land through corporate restructuring.

---

#### **10. Exclusions by the Minister**

The **Associate Minister of Public Lands and Wildlife** may **exclude** certain persons, transactions, or land uses from the regulations, including:

- Specific persons or classes of persons,
- Transactions or classes of transactions,
- Interests or classes of interests,
- Uses of land,
- All or part of land within a **hamlet** (as defined in the *Municipal Government Act*).

> These exclusions are **temporary** and require formal approval.  
> Exclusions under the *Temporary* Regulations are **treated as valid exclusions**
