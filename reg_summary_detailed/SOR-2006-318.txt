#### **3. Key Provisions (Detailed Breakdown)**

| Provision | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Content of Prospectus** | Any information required to be disclosed prior to a distribution of securities must be included in a prospectus. This content must align with the requirements set out in the legislation listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**. The Schedule identifies specific acts or statutes (e.g., the *Securities Act*, *Bank Act*, *Bank Act (prospectus requirements)*, etc.) that govern the content of disclosure. |
| **2. Disclosure Procedure** | The method or process for disclosing information must follow the procedure required under any legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule. This includes requirements such as filing timelines, notification procedures, and internal review processes. |
| **3. Form of Disclosure** | The information must be presented in the form required by any applicable legislation in Column 2 of the Schedule. This ensures consistency in format (e.g., structured sections, financial statements, risk factors, management information, etc.) across different regulatory frameworks. |
| **4. Compliance with Legislation** | A prospectus filed under any of the listed legislation must fully comply with the specific requirements of that legislation. This includes legal, financial, and disclosure standards applicable to that statute. |
| **5. Exemptions** | A person who is **exempt** from prospectus requirements under any of the listed legislation (e.g., due to small size, private placement, or a specific exemption clause) or who has been granted an exemption by a **provincial securities regulator**, is **also exempt** from those same requirements under these Regulations. This creates a harmonized exemption framework across federal and provincial rules. |

> Note: The repeated "[Repeal]" entries suggest that earlier versions of the regulation were replaced or superseded — indicating this is a current, updated version.

#### **4. Scope of Application**

- Applies to **distributions of securities**, including:
  - Issuance of shares (common, preferred).
  - Public offerings of debt securities (bonds, notes).
- Applies **before distribution** — meaning disclosures must be made prior to any public sale or offering.

- It **prevents regulatory duplication** by aligning federal bank-specific rules with broader securities disclosure standards.
- It provides **clarity on exemptions** — if a bank or holding company is exempt from prospectus obligations under another law (e.g., because the offering is private or qualifies under a small issuer rule), it is automatically exempt under these regulations as well.

#### **7. Enforcement and Oversight**
- The **Minister of Finance** and the **provincial securities regulators** (e.g., Ontario Securities Commission, BC Securities Commission) have oversight responsibilities.
- The regulations support enforcement by ensuring that all disclosures meet the minimum standards required by law.
