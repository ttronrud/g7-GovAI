**Statutory Authority:**  
The regulation is made under **subsection 5(1)** of the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act* (S.C. 2006, c. 10), which authorizes the Governor in Council to bring into effect individual agreements between the Government of Canada and First Nations regarding education jurisdiction.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation formally **gives legal effect** to four individual agreements between the Government of Canada and specific First Nations. These agreements establish **education jurisdiction** for the respective First Nations, meaning that the First Nations have the authority to govern and manage education within their communities—specifically, to administer and oversee education programs, policies, and services for their members—under the framework of the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act*.

This is a significant step in advancing **Indigenous self-determination**, particularly in the area of education, allowing First Nations to take greater control over educational systems in their communities.

### **Legal Effect of the Order**

Under the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act*, once these agreements are brought into effect by this Order, the First Nations involved are recognized as having **exclusive jurisdiction** over education matters within their territories, including:

- Establishing and operating schools  
- Setting curriculum and educational standards  
- Hiring and managing education staff  
- Developing education policies and programs  
- Managing funding and resources for education  

This jurisdiction is **not shared** with provincial or federal authorities in the areas specified in the agreements, thereby affirming the autonomy of these First Nations in education governance.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on July 1, 2022**.  
- However, if the Order is **registered later than July 1, 2022**, it will take effect on the **date of registration**.

This provision ensures that the legal effect of the agreements is realized in a timely manner while allowing for administrative processes (such as registration with the federal government) to occur without disrupting implementation.

---

### **Amendments and Legal Context**

- This regulation does **not amend** the original agreements. It only **formally brings them into legal effect** under the Act.
- The agreements themselves remain the primary documents governing education jurisdiction and are subject to review, renewal, or modification as per the terms agreed upon.
- The Order is consistent with broader federal and provincial commitments to **Indigenous self-governance**, **cultural revitalization**, and **education equity**.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Self-Determination:** This Order is a concrete manifestation of the Government of Canada’s commitment to recognizing and supporting First Nations’ right to self-governance in education.
- **Cultural Relevance:** By allowing First Nations to design education systems that reflect their languages, values, and worldviews, the agreements promote cultural preservation and identity.
- **Improved Educational Outcomes:** Community-led education models are often more responsive to local needs and can lead to better engagement, retention, and outcomes for students.
- **Legal Clarity:** The Order provides clear, enforceable legal status to these agreements, ensuring that all stakeholders—First Nations, federal government, and provincial authorities—understand the jurisdictional boundaries.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a pivotal step in advancing Indigenous education sovereignty in British Columbia. By formally recognizing and implementing four individual education jurisdiction agreements, it affirms the legal and practical capacity of First Nations to lead and manage education in their communities. It reflects a shift toward **collaborative governance**, **Indigenous leadership**, and **decentralized education systems** that are more responsive to local realities and cultural contexts.

It also serves as a model for future agreements between Canada and other First Nations seeking to establish similar education jurisdictional arrangements.
