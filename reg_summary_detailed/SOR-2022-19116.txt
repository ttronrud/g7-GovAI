Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, broken down into clear, logical sections for better understanding and application.

## **Detailed Summary of the Underused Housing Tax Act Regulations (Section 116 Regulations)**

### **1. Reference to the Act**
- **"Act"** refers to the *Underused Housing Tax Act* (UHTA).
- This regulation interprets and applies specific provisions of the Act, particularly concerning **residential condominium units**, **prescribed areas**, and **conditions under which tax may be exempted**.

---

### **2. Definition of "Prescribed Property" for Residential Condominium Units**

A particular residential condominium unit in a building with **four or more units** is considered **prescribed property** (i.e., eligible for tax exemption under the Act) if **both** of the following conditions are met:

#### **Condition 1: Ownership Structure**
- The person who owns **all or substantially all** of the residential condominium units in the building is also the **owner of the particular unit in question**.

> Example: If a single entity owns 95% of the units in a 10-unit building, and it owns the specific unit being considered, that unit qualifies as prescribed property.

#### **Condition 2: Purpose of Ownership**
- All or substantially all of the units owned by that person are held **primarily for the purpose of providing continuous occupancy** as a **place of residence or lodging** for individuals for **at least one month**.

> This means the ownership is not for investment, rental income, or speculative purposes — it must be for **residential use**.

> Key phrase: "continuous occupancy" implies that individuals live in the units regularly, not just temporarily or sporadically.

> The requirement of "at least one month" ensures that the property is not used only for short-term stays.

> The term "substantially all" is interpreted flexibly but generally means a majority (e.g., 50% or more) of the units.

### **3. Definitions Used in the Regulation**

These definitions are based on **Statistics Canada’s Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) 2021** and are used to determine **prescribed areas** and **exemptions**.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Census Metropolitan Area (CMA)** | A defined urban area with a population of at least 100,000, as per SGC 2021. These are large metropolitan regions. |
| **Population Centre (PC)** | A core urban area with a population of at least 10,000, typically a city or major town within a CMA. |
| **Specified Census Agglomeration (SCA)** | A census agglomeration (a larger geographic area than a CMA) with a **total population of at least 30,000**. These are mid-sized urban or suburban areas. |

> These definitions are critical for determining **which areas qualify as "prescribed areas"** under the Act.

---

### **4. Prescribed Areas for a Calendar Year**

Under **paragraph 6(7)(m)** of the Act, the following areas are designated as **prescribed areas** for a given calendar year:

#### **Area 1: Outside CMAs or SCAs**
- An area that, as determined in the **last published census before the calendar year**, is:
  - **Not within a census metropolitan area (CMA)**,
  - **Not within a specified census agglomeration (SCA)**.

> This includes rural or remote areas that are not part of major urban centers.

#### **Area 2: Within a CMA or SCA, but Outside a Population Centre**
- An area that is:
  - **Within a CMA or SCA**, and
  - **Not within a population centre (PC)**.

> Example: A small town or rural community located within a larger urban agglomeration but outside the main city center (e.g., a satellite village or outlying settlement).

> This provision ensures that tax exemptions apply to areas outside the most densely populated centers — possibly to support housing in less developed or underserved regions.

> **Note:** The determination is based on the **last census published before the calendar year**, meaning the 2021 census is used for the 2022–2023 years.

### **5. Prescribed Conditions for Exemption from Tax (Paragraph 6(7)(m))**

A person may be exempt from paying tax on a particular residential property **if one of the following conditions applies** during the calendar year:

#### **Condition A: Personal Use by Owner or Spouse/Partner**
- The **person or their spouse or common-law partner** uses the particular residential property as a **place of residence or lodging** for **at least 28 days** during the year.
- The person **declares in their tax return** that **no tax is payable** on this property under this paragraph or paragraph 6(7)(m).
- **Crucially**, the person or their spouse/common-law partner **does not claim** that no tax is payable on **any other residential property** under the same provisions.

> This prevents abuse of the exemption — it ensures the exemption is only applied to one property per taxpayer.

> The 28-day threshold is a **minimum residency requirement** — it is lower than the one-month requirement in the ownership definition, suggesting that personal use is sufficient for exemption even if not continuous.

> The declaration must be made in the **tax return filed under the Act**.

#### **Condition B: Business Use for Employees or Contractors**

- The property is **held primarily to provide a place of residence or lodging** for an individual who:
  - Is an **officer** (a person holding an office) or **employee** of the operator,
  - Or a **contractor** or **employee of a contractor**, engaged by the operator to render services at that location,
  - Or a **subcontractor** or **employee of a subcontractor**, engaged by a contractor to provide services to the operator.

> The key phrase: **"primarily to provide a place of residence or lodging"** — the property must serve a **business function**.

> The individual must be required to be physically present at the location to perform their duties.

> The "operator" must be a person **related to the taxpayer** (e.g., spouse, sibling, parent, child) or the taxpayer themselves.

> This provision supports **remote work or field-based business operations** where employees or contractors need housing near the workplace.

> The property is not for general rental — it is for **on-site work**.

> This condition applies **only if the property is used as a residence or lodging for a worker** engaged in duties for the operator.

---

### **6. Social Insurance Number (SIN) Requirement**

- The **Minister may require** an individual to provide their **Social Insurance Number (SIN)** when filing a return under the Act.

> This enhances the ability to verify identity, track tax obligations, and prevent fraud or misuse of the exemption.

> It is a procedural requirement and not a tax liability itself.

---

### **7. Applicability of Provisions by Calendar Year**

The regulation applies to different calendar years under different subsections:

| Subsection | Applies to |
|----------|-----------|
| **(1)** | **2022 calendar year** |
| **(2) and (3)** | **2023 and subsequent years** |
| **(4)** | **2024 and subsequent years** |

> This phased implementation suggests a gradual rollout of the regulation, allowing time for stakeholders (e.g., property owners, tax professionals) to adjust to the rules.

> The 2022 application of subsection (1) indicates that the core definition of prescribed property and prescribed areas begins in that year.

> Subsections (2) and (3) introduce the **personal use** and **business use** conditions in later years, likely to allow for policy refinement and feedback.

---

### **8. Legal Authority and Validity of the Regulation**

The regulation is deemed to have been made under the following legal foundations:

- **Section 84 of the Underused Housing Tax Act** — authorizes the Minister to make regulations under the Act.
- **Subsection 5(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act** — confirms that the regulation has been transmitted to the Clerk of the Privy Council for **registration**.
- **Subsection 11(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act** — confirms that the regulation meets the **publication requirements** (i.e., it is publicly accessible and legally valid).

> This ensures the regulation is **legally sound, properly published, and enforceable**.

---

## **Key Objectives of the Regulation**

1. **Promote Affordable Housing**: By exempting certain residential units (especially those used for long-term occupancy) from tax, the regulation supports housing availability in rural and underserved areas.
2. **Prevent Tax Avoidance**: The conditions (e.g., 28 days of use, no claims on other properties) prevent misuse of the exemption.
3. **Support Remote Work and Business Operations**: Allows business operators to provide housing for employees or contractors working on-site.
4. **Encourage Ownership for Residency**: Encourages individuals to own multiple units not for profit, but for continuous residential use.
5. **Ensure Geographic Fairness**: Exemptions are targeted at areas outside major urban centers, reducing tax burden in rural or less developed regions.
