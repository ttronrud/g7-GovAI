**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Tourism Commission Divestiture Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Tourism Commission Divestiture Regulations*, made under the authority of the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (the "Act") and the *Financial Administration Act*, were enacted on **January 2, 2004**, to address the legal and superannuation implications arising from the **divestiture of the Canadian Tourism Commission (the "Commission") from the public service**.

This regulation governs how public service superannuation benefits are applied to individuals who were employed by the Commission *on or before January 1, 2004*, and who **continued to be employed by the Commission for at least one day after that date**, but who subsequently ceased employment due to the Commission no longer being considered part of the public service effective January 2, 2004.

---

### **Key Legal Authority**

These Regulations are issued under two specific provisions:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act** – Authorizes the Treasury Board to make regulations regarding the treatment of employees of entities that cease to be part of the public service.
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act** – Grants the Treasury Board the power to make regulations concerning the administration of public service superannuation.

---

### **Scope and Application**

#### **Who is Covered?**

These Regulations apply to a person who:
1. Was **employed by the Canadian Tourism Commission on January 1, 2004**;
2. **Remained employed by the Commission for at least one day after January 1, 2004**;
3. **Ceased to be considered employed in the public service** as of **January 2, 2004**, when the Commission was formally removed from the public service for superannuation purposes.

> ⚠️ **Exclusions**:
> - Individuals who **subsequently become re-employed** by the Commission are **not covered**.
> - Individuals who have already **received a return of contributions** under subsection 3(3) of the Act or who have **exercised an option under subsection 3(4)** are **excluded** from the application of Sections 4 to 9.

---

### **Key Provisions and Their Implications**

#### **1. Application of Sections 4 to 9 (General Superannuation Rules)**
- These sections (which typically deal with retirement, pension rights, and contribution returns) **do not apply** to individuals who have:
  - Already received a return of contributions (under subsection 3(3)), or
  - Exercised an option under subsection 3(4) (e.g., to receive a return or a pension).

> This means that those who have already exercised their rights under the Act are not subject to the standard rules of retirement or pension entitlements.

---

#### **2. Application of Sections 12 to 13.01 (Return of Contributions and Death Benefits)**

- These provisions apply **only to individuals who cease employment by the Commission on or after January 2, 2004**.
- This means that the rights to a **return of contributions** and **survivor benefits** are triggered only when a person leaves the Commission on or after that date.

> This ensures that the superannuation regime is applied retroactively only to those who were formally removed from public service status on January 2, 2004.

---

#### **3. Deemed Employment by a New Employer (Section 13.01)**

- For the purposes of **section 13.01 of the Act** (which governs survivor benefits and allowances), a person who ceases employment with the Commission is **deemed to be employed by a new employer** as defined in **subsection 83(1) of the Public Service Superannuation Regulations**.

> This is a critical provision because it ensures that the survivor and children of a deceased employee are treated as having a valid claim under the superannuation system, even though the individual was not formally employed by a traditional employer.

---

#### **4. Right to Request Return of Contributions (Despite Subsection 1)**

- Even though the general rule may exclude such claims, **if on January 2, 2004** a person would have been entitled to a **return of contributions under subsection 12(3) of the Act**, they may:
  - **Request in writing** payment of that entitlement;
  - Do so **within one year** after January 2, 2004.

> This creates a **one-year window** for individuals to claim a return of contributions, even if the normal rules would not otherwise apply.

---

#### **5. Right to Exercise Option under Section 13.01**

- If on January 2, 2004 a person would have been entitled to **exercise an option under section 13.01** (e.g., to receive a survivor benefit or allowance), they may:
  - Exercise that option **within one year** after January 2, 2004.

> This ensures that individuals who were eligible for survivor benefits or allowances under the Act are not deprived of their rights due to the change in status of the Commission.

---

#### **6. Death Benefit and Survivor Allowances**

- **Death Benefit (Section 12(8))**:
  - The **survivor and children** of a person who dies while employed by the Commission are entitled to a **return of contributions** as a death benefit.

- **Survivor Allowances (Section 13(3))**:
  - Survivors and children are entitled to the allowances specified in **paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b)** of the Act (typically including a monthly allowance for dependents).
  - These allowances are subject to the **limitations in subsections 12(4) and (5)** of the Act (e.g., age thresholds, dependency rules, maximum amounts).

> These provisions ensure that the family of a deceased employee continues to receive financial support from the superannuation system.

---

#### **7. Deemed Cessation of Public Service Employment**

- For the purposes of **subsection 26(2) of the Act**, a person is **deemed to cease to be employed in the public service** on the **day they cease to be employed by the Commission**.

> This means that the date of leaving the Commission is the official date of leaving public service for superannuation purposes.

---

#### **8. One-Year Period for Section 10(5) (Notice of Cessation)**

- The one-year period referred to in **paragraph 10(5)(a)** of the Act (which relates to notice requirements or administrative timelines) **begins on the date the person ceases to be employed by the Commission**.

> This ensures that all time-sensitive administrative processes (e.g., notice of termination, benefit claims) start from the day of actual employment cessation.

---

#### **9. Pensionable Service and Age for Retirement**

- **Pensionable service** for the purposes of sections 12 and 13 of the Act includes:
  - The period of service with the Commission that **begins on January 2, 2004** and **ends on the date the person ceases to be employed by the Commission**.

- The **age of the person** at the time of ceasing employment is defined as:
  - The age of the person on the **day they cease to be employed by the Commission**.

> This ensures that service after January 2, 2004 is counted toward retirement benefits and age eligibility.

---

#### **10. Group 1 Contributor Status**

- Any contributor to whom these Regulations apply is **deemed to be a Group 1 contributor**.

> This classification is important because Group 1 contributors are typically those in the public service and are entitled to specific superannuation benefits under the Act (e.g., full pension rights, survivor benefits, etc.).

---

### **Effective Date**

- These Regulations **come into force on January 2, 2004** — the same day the Commission ceased to be part of the public service for superannuation purposes.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

This regulation was designed to:

1. **Ensure continuity of superannuation rights** for employees of the Canadian Tourism Commission who were employed during the transition period (January 1–2, 2004).
2. **Provide clear legal pathways** for individuals to claim returns of contributions or survivor benefits.
3. **Maintain fairness and consistency** in how public service superannuation is applied when a public entity is divested from the public service.
4. **Protect the rights of employees and their families**, especially in cases of death or retirement during a transitional period.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Canadian Tourism Commission Divestiture Regulations* serve as a **targeted, transitional framework** to manage the superannuation obligations of employees who were employed by the Commission during a period of structural change. By clearly defining eligibility, timelines, and rights—particularly regarding returns of contributions, survivor benefits, and pensionable service—these regulations ensure that individuals are not disadvantaged by the Commission’s removal from the public service.

They reflect a careful balance between administrative clarity and employee protection, aligning with broader principles of fairness, equity, and legal certainty in public service superannuation.

**Final Note**: These regulations are specific to the divestiture of the Canadian Tourism Commission and do not apply to other public entities or employees outside of that context.
