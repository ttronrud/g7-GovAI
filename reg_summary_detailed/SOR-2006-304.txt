### **1. Regulatory Authority and Source**
- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation**: Made on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.
- **Legal Basis**: Pursuant to **subsection 2.1(1)a** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (CCA Act).
- **Statutory Citation**:  
  - S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 141  
  - S.C. 1991, c. 48  

> This means the regulations are formally enacted by the federal government, based on delegated authority from the CCA Act, and are specifically designed to define when a cooperative credit association qualifies as a "distributing association."

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

#### ✅ What Constitutes a "Distributing Association"?

A distributing cooperative credit association is defined as **any one of the following**, for the purposes of the CCA Act:

| Condition | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **(a)** | An association that is a **reporting issuer** under any legislation listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**. |
| **(b)** | An association that is **not** a reporting issuer under (a), but: <br> - Has filed a **prospectus or registration statement** under **provincial or foreign securities legislation**, <br> - And whose **securities are listed and posted for trading** on a **stock exchange in or outside Canada**. |
| **(c)** | An association that is involved in, formed for, results from, or continues after: <br> - An **amalgamation**, <br> - A **reorganization**, <br> - An **arrangement**, or <br> - A **statutory procedure**, <br> **if at least one participating body corporate** is an entity that falls under either (i) or (ii) above. |

> These conditions establish a broad but structured definition of what qualifies as a "distributing association," emphasizing both formal reporting obligations and market participation.

---

### **3. Exclusions from the Definition**

An association is **NOT** considered a distributing association **if**:

- It is **exempt** under **provincial securities legislation**, or  
- It is subject to an **order issued by a provincial securities regulator** that explicitly states it is **not a reporting issuer** under the applicable legislation.

> This exclusion is critical: even if an association meets other criteria, if it is legally exempt from reporting requirements under provincial law, it does **not** count as a distributing association under these regulations.

---

### **4. Interpretation of "Reporting Issuer"**

The regulations explicitly reference and adopt the definition of "reporting issuer" from **several key provincial securities acts**, including:

| Jurisdiction | Relevant Act and Section |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Ontario | *Securities Act*, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5, s. 1(1) (as amended) |
| Quebec | *Securities Act*, R.S.Q. c. V-1.1, s. 5 and s. 68 (as amended) |
| Newfoundland and Labrador | *Securities Act*, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. S-13, para. 2(1)(oo) (as amended) |
| Nova Scotia | *Securities Act*, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 418, para. 2(1)(ao) (as amended) |
| Saskatchewan | *Securities Act*, S.C. 2004, c. S-5.5, s. 1(1) (as amended) |
| Manitoba | *Securities Act*, R.S.M. c. S50, s. 1(1) (as amended) |
| British Columbia | *Securities Act*, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418, s. 1(1) (as amended) |
| Prince Edward Island | *Securities Act*, 1988, S.S. 1988–89, c. S-42.2, para. 2(1)(qq) (as amended) |
| Alberta | *Securities Act*, R.S.A. 2000, c. S-4, para. 2(1)(ccc) and s. 145 (as amended) |

> This ensures **consistency** in the definition of "reporting issuer" across jurisdictions, which is essential because the regulations rely on provincial definitions to determine whether an association qualifies as a distributing association.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., published in the *Canada Gazette* or official register).

> This means they are immediately applicable upon formal adoption, without a specified delay.

---

## 📌 Key Objectives and Implications

### ✅ Purpose of the Regulations
- To **clarify and define** when a cooperative credit association qualifies as a "distributing association" under the CCA Act.
- To ensure **regulatory alignment** between federal cooperative credit rules and provincial securities laws.
- To provide **clear criteria** for determining reporting obligations, governance, and financial transparency requirements for cooperatives involved in public markets.

### 🔍 Why It Matters
- **Distributing associations** are typically subject to **greater regulatory scrutiny**, including disclosure requirements, capital adequacy standards, and reporting obligations.
- The definition helps **identify cooperatives** that operate at a scale or level of market activity that resembles publicly traded entities.
- It supports **transparency** and **accountability** in cooperative financial structures, especially when securities are traded publicly.

## ⚠️ Important Notes and Limitations

1. **Provincial Exemptions Matter**:  
   Even if a cooperative is publicly traded or has filed a prospectus, if it is exempt from reporting under provincial securities law, it is **not** a distributing association.

2. **Amalgamation/Reorganization Triggers**:  
   A new entity formed through a merger or reorganization may become a distributing association **if one of the participating bodies** is already one (e.g., a reporting issuer or publicly traded entity).

3. **Market Listing is Key**:  
   For non-reporting issuers, **listing on a stock exchange** (domestic or foreign) is a critical factor in qualifying as a distributing association.

4. **Dynamic Definitions**:  
   The references to "as amended from time to time" mean that the rules remain current with changes in provincial securities legislation.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

The **Distributing Cooperative Credit Association Regulations** provide a **comprehensive, jurisdictionally sensitive framework** for identifying which cooperative credit associations are considered "distributing" under federal law. By linking the definition to provincial securities laws and including both direct reporting and market-based criteria, the regulations ensure that cooperatives engaging in public markets or significant financial transactions are appropriately regulated.

This regulatory framework enhances **financial transparency**, **market integrity**, and **cooperative governance**, while respecting the autonomy of provincial securities regimes through exemptions and defined reporting thresholds.

---

📌 **In short**:  
> A cooperative is a "distributing association" if it is a reporting issuer under provincial law, has publicly traded securities, or arises from a transaction involving a reporting entity — **unless exempted** by provincial regulators.
