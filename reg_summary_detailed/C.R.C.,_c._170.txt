### Key Definitions (As Used in the Order)

1. **Act**  
   Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (French: *Loi sur le marché des produits agricoles*).  
   → This is the foundational legislation that authorizes the Board and Commission to regulate the marketing of farm products, including apples.

2. **Apples**  
   Means *apples of every variety produced in Ontario*.  
   → The term is broad and inclusive, covering all types of apples grown within the province, regardless of cultivar (e.g., Gala, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, etc.). This ensures comprehensive coverage of all apple production in Ontario.

3. **Board**  
   Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario*.  
   → Established under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*, the Board has regulatory authority over the marketing of farm products, including apples, both within Ontario and in interprovincial and export markets.

4. **Commission**  
   Refers to *The Ontario Apple Marketing Commission*.  
   → A specialized body created under the same Act to manage and regulate the specific marketing of apples. It operates under the broader framework of the Act and is responsible for implementing policies related to apple pricing, quality, distribution, and market access.

5. **Plan**  
   Means *any plan and regulations established and made under the Act respecting the marketing of apples*, including any amendments to those plans or regulations.  
   → The "Plan" is a dynamic set of rules and guidelines that govern how apples are marketed, priced, and distributed. It may include rules on grading, pricing mechanisms, marketing quotas, export standards, and more. Amendments to the Plan are permitted and can be made under the authority of the Act.

### Core Regulatory Authority

The most significant provision of the Order is the **grant of regulatory powers** to both the Board and the Commission.

> *“The Board and the Commission are each authorized to regulate the marketing of apples in interprovincial and export trade and for such purposes may, with respect to persons and property situated within the Province of Ontario, exercise all or any powers like the powers exercisable by each of them in relation to the marketing of apples locally within that Province under the Act and the Plan.”*

#### Breakdown of this Provision:

- **Regulatory Scope**:  
  The Board and the Commission have authority to regulate the marketing of apples in:
  - **Interprovincial trade** (sales between Ontario and other Canadian provinces)
  - **Export trade** (sales of Ontario apples outside Canada)

- **Power to Exercise Authority**:  
  For the purposes of regulating interprovincial and export markets, both bodies may exercise **all or any of the powers** they have when regulating apple marketing *within Ontario*. This means they can apply the same rules and enforcement mechanisms used domestically—such as pricing controls, quality standards, volume limitations, and market access rules—to transactions outside the province or abroad.

- **Application to Persons and Property in Ontario**:  
  These powers apply to individuals, businesses, and property located *within the Province of Ontario*. This ensures that the regulatory framework is enforceable and consistent across the province, even when the transaction involves out-of-province or international buyers.

### Purpose and Implications

This Order ensures that:
- The marketing of Ontario apples is coordinated and standardized across domestic and international markets.
- The Board and Commission can maintain fair and stable market conditions, prevent market manipulation, and protect producers and consumers.
- There is consistency in rules and enforcement whether apples are being sold locally, shipped to other provinces, or exported internationally.
- The regulatory system remains flexible through the inclusion of "any amendments" to the Plan, allowing for adaptation to changing market conditions, supply dynamics, or economic factors.

### Summary in Plain Language:

The *Ontario Apple Order* gives the Ontario Apple Marketing Commission and the Farm Products Marketing Board the legal authority to manage how apples from Ontario are sold—both within the province and outside of it. They can apply the same rules and controls used in local markets (such as pricing, quality, and volume limits) to interprovincial and export sales. This ensures a fair, transparent, and consistent marketing system that supports Ontario apple producers while maintaining market stability and consumer confidence.

**In essence**:  
This Order is a foundational regulatory instrument that enables Ontario to maintain control over its apple marketing system, both domestically and internationally, by empowering specialized bodies with broad regulatory powers grounded in the *Farm Products Marketing Act*.
