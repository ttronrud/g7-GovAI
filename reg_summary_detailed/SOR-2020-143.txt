**Detailed Summary of the Vaping Products Promotion Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Vaping Products Promotion Regulations* (the "Regulations") were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, under **section 33a of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (the "Act")**. These regulations establish detailed rules governing how vaping products and their associated brand elements can be promoted — particularly with respect to **advertising, display at point of sale, and health warnings** — with the primary objective of **protecting young people from exposure to vaping product promotion**.

These regulations are designed to ensure that advertising and promotional activities do not appeal to youth, while still allowing certain exceptions for legitimate, responsible commercial practices.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Prohibition of Promotion to Young Persons (Section 30.701 of the Act)**

> **Core Principle**: Vaping products or vaping product-related brand elements **must not be promoted** through advertising that allows young persons to see or hear it.

- This includes all forms of advertising (visual, audio, digital) that could reasonably be seen or heard by minors.
- The intent is to prevent marketing strategies that may appeal to youth — such as vibrant visuals, sounds, or suggestive messaging.

> **Exceptions**:
- **Point-of-sale visual advertising** (e.g., on shelves or counters) is allowed **if** the following conditions are met:
  - Located at the point of sale.
  - Meets specific criteria under **paragraphs 6(1)(a) to (d)** (e.g., minimal design, clear text, no attention-grabbing effects).
- **Signs at retail establishments** where vaping products are sold are allowed **if**:
  - They indicate **only** availability and price.
  - No visual, sound, or other effects draw attention.
  - Use only black characters on a white background.
  - Are rectangular and no larger than **3,600 cm²**.
  - Only one such sign exists per establishment.
- **Advertising addressed to adults by name** (e.g., direct mail with recipient name) is exempt.
- **Advertising provided on request at point of sale** (e.g., customer asks for a flyer) is exempt.
- **Advertising not visible to young persons** (e.g., behind locked doors, in restricted areas) is exempt.

> **Note**: These exceptions are limited and require strict compliance with design and content standards.

### **2. Restrictions on Display at Point of Sale (Section 30.8 of the Act)**

The Regulations prohibit the **display of vaping products, their packaging, or brand elements** in a manner that allows them to be seen by young persons.

> **Prohibited Displays**:
- Vaping product itself.
- Product packaging.
- Brand elements (logos, designs, names) related to vaping products.

> **Exceptions**:
- If **provincial legislation** governing the retail establishment **prohibits** such displays, the Regulations do not apply.
- This allows provinces to set their own rules (e.g., stricter display bans in schools or youth zones).

### **3. Visual Advertising at Point of Sale – Strict Conditions**

For visual advertising at point of sale to be permitted, the following **four conditions must be met**:

1. **Only one advertisement** may be present at the point of sale.
2. The advertisement must indicate **only**:
   - Availability of vaping products.
   - Price of the products.
3. It must **not** include:
   - Visual, sound, or other effects that draw attention (e.g., flashing lights, music, animations).
4. It must use **only black characters on a white background**.

> **Additional Exemption**:
- If the advertising is done in a manner that **does not allow young persons to see it**, it is exempt (e.g., behind glass, in non-visible zones).

> **Provincial Law Override**:
- If provincial law applies to signage or display rules, the Regulations do not apply.
