| **Fireplace** | Includes grills, stoves, or any cooking facility used for heating or cooking. |
| **Maintain** (in respect of fire) | To add fuel to a fire, enjoy its use, or allow it to burn — legally equivalent to "keeping a fire alive." |

### **5. Permitted Fires in National Parks**

Only the following types of fires are allowed:

> 📝 Example: A permit might be required for a large outdoor cookout or for a controlled burn in a remote area.

---

### **7. Fire Extinguishing Obligations**

- **Every person who starts and maintains a fire must extinguish it when it is no longer needed.**
- Failure to do so may result in enforcement action or penalties.

> ✅ Prevents unattended fires that can ignite surrounding vegetation or structures.

2. **Discard a lighted cigar, cigarette, match, or any burning substance** — even if seemingly small.
3. **Discard unused matches or any flammable materials** — all such items must be disposed of safely.
4. **Operate machinery without fire/spark prevention equipment** — all equipment must have adequate fire suppression systems.
5. **Accumulate, store, handle, transport, or dispose of brush or flammable materials** unless approved by the superintendent.

### **11. Reporting Unattended Fires**

---

### **12. Exclusions from Application**

These regulations **do not apply** in:
- The **Town of Banff**
- The **Town of Jasper**
