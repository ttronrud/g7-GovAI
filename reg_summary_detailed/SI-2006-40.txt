### Background and Context:

Statutory Instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation used in the UK to implement or amend primary legislation (Acts of Parliament). SI 2015/110 was one such instrument, likely introduced to implement a specific provision of a primary Act. However, because it is now **repealed**, it is no longer in force.

- The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
- A more comprehensive or updated piece of legislation was introduced.
- A policy shift occurred that rendered the regulation unnecessary or incompatible.
- A legal or administrative review found that the regulation was flawed or ineffective.
