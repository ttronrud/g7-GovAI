**Detailed Summary of the Privacy Act Extension Order, No. 3**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The Privacy Act Extension Order, No. 3 is issued by His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. This action is authorized under **subsection 12(3) of the Privacy Act (R.S., c. P-21)**, which empowers the Government of Canada to extend or modify the application of certain provisions of the Act in specific circumstances.

**Key Provision of the Order:**

The central purpose of this Order is to **extend the right to access personal information**—as established under **subsection 12(1) of the Privacy Act**—to **all individuals outside of Canada** who have not previously been granted access to such information.

**Scope and Application:**

- **Who is Covered:** The extension applies to **all individuals residing outside Canada**.
- **What is Extended:** The right under subsection 12(1) of the Privacy Act, which allows individuals to access personal information held by federal institutions, is now extended to these non-Canadian residents.
- **Limitation:** The extension does **not apply retroactively** to individuals who already had access rights under existing provisions or to those who were previously granted access under other legal frameworks or prior Orders.

**Effective Date:**

The Order comes into force on the **first anniversary of the day it is made**. This means that individuals outside Canada will not be able to exercise their right to access personal information under this Order until one full year after the Order is formally published and enacted.

**Purpose and Significance:**

- This Order reflects Canada’s commitment to upholding privacy rights for all individuals, regardless of geographic location.
- It ensures that non-Canadian residents who have personal information held by federal government institutions (e.g., in immigration records, tax data, or health information) are not excluded from their right to access that information.
- It strengthens the consistency and fairness of the Privacy Act’s application, particularly in a globalized world where individuals may have ties to Canada through work, travel, or residency in other countries.

**Legal Context:**

- The Privacy Act (R.S., c. P-21) governs how federal institutions collect, use, and disclose personal information.
- Subsection 12(1) grants individuals the right to access their personal information held by federal institutions.
- Subsection 12(3) allows the Government to extend or modify the scope of this right through Orders made in Council, particularly when there is a need to expand access to individuals not previously covered.

**Implications:**

- Non-Canadian individuals may now request access to their personal information held by federal departments (e.g., Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Health Canada, Revenue Canada).
- Federal institutions must respond to such requests in accordance with the Privacy Act’s requirements, including providing information within a reasonable timeframe and ensuring compliance with privacy principles.
- The Order may prompt changes in institutional procedures to accommodate international access requests.

**Conclusion:**

The Privacy Act Extension Order, No. 3 is a significant step toward ensuring equitable access to personal information under Canadian privacy law. By extending the right to access personal information to all individuals outside Canada, the Government reinforces transparency, accountability, and individual rights in the management of personal data. However, the one-year delay in enforcement provides time for federal agencies to prepare and implement necessary processes to meet the new obligations.

This Order is a practical and principled expansion of privacy protections, aligning Canada’s domestic privacy framework with international standards and the realities of global mobility.
