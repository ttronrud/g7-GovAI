**Detailed Summary of the *Counting of Service by Former Members of the Senate or House of Commons Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are formally titled:  
**"The Counting of Service by Former Members of the Senate or House of Commons Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and serve to define how former members of the Senate or House of Commons may have their prior parliamentary service counted as **pensionable service** under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (Act).

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (Loi), which governs the pension rights of public servants in Canada.
- **Contributor**: A person who has made contributions under the Act (i.e., a public servant eligible for superannuation benefits).
- **Minister**: Refers to the **President of the Treasury Board**, who has authority to prescribe forms and oversee implementation of the regulations.

---

### **3. Eligibility to Count Parliamentary Service as Pensionable Service**

A contributor may **elect to count** a period of service during which they were members of the Senate or House of Commons — and made contributions under the *Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act* (MPRA) — as **pensionable service** under Part I of the Public Service Superannuation Act **if**:

1. The election is made in a form **prescribed by the Minister**; and  
2. The contributor **surrenders their right to receive an allowance** under the MPRA for that service.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This election is a **voluntary and irrevocable** choice that requires giving up the existing retirement allowance under the MPRA.

---

### **4. How Pensionable Service is Credited**

Upon making the election, the contributor will be credited with **two components** of pensionable service:

#### (a) Periods of pensionable service already credited under the MPRA  
At the time the contributor ceased to serve in the Senate or House of Commons, the periods of pensionable service already recognized under **subsection 24(2) of the MPRA** will be counted.

#### (b) Additional periods of service under Part I or VI of the MPRA  
Any contributions made under **Part I or VI** of the MPRA (which relate to retirement allowances) that were **not previously counted** for determining pensionable service will now be included.

> This means that prior parliamentary service can be added to the contributor’s pensionable service record, potentially increasing their pension entitlement under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

---

### **5. Medical Examination Requirements**

Medical examination is required in certain circumstances to ensure that the contributor is physically capable of continuing in public service.

#### **When a medical exam is required:**

- **If the election is made within one year** of becoming a contributor:  
  → A medical examination is required **unless** the contributor has been employed **without interruption** in any of the following:
  - The Public Service  
  - The regular force (e.g., police, military)  
  - The Senate or House of Commons  
  - Any combination of the above

- **If the election is made after one year** of becoming a contributor:  
  → A medical examination is **mandatory**.

- **Exception**: If the contributor falls under **paragraph 3(b)** (a specific category of individuals — likely those with certain health or service conditions), a medical exam is required **regardless of timing**.

> The medical examination ensures that the individual can perform the duties of a public servant for at least five years.

---

### **6. Conduct and Reporting of Medical Examinations**

- The examination must be conducted by a **licensed or authorized physician** in the jurisdiction where it is performed.
- The physician must complete and submit **Form NHW 365** or **NHW-SNBS 366** (Department of National Health and Welfare forms).
- The completed form must be submitted to the **Medical Services Branch** of the Department of National Health and Welfare.

> These forms collect medical data relevant to the individual’s capacity to work.

---

### **7. Timing of Medical Examination**

- The exam must be conducted **no more than three months before** and **no more than six months after** the election.
- If a contributor **fails to undergo** the required medical examination within this window, they may still do so within **30 days** after being formally notified by the Minister.

---

### **8. Passing the Medical Examination**

A contributor is deemed to have **passed** the medical examination if the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Medical Services Branch determines, based on the submitted form, that:

1. The person is **capable of five years of continuous employment** performing the duties they held at the time of the exam; **OR**  
2. The person has a **normal life expectancy**.

> These are the two acceptable medical outcomes for eligibility.

---

### **9. Inadequate Medical Information**

If the information in the submitted form is **insufficient** to make a determination, the Assistant Deputy Minister may require the individual to undergo a **further medical examination**.

- If the person **does not comply** with this requirement, they are deemed **not to have passed** the medical examination.
- As a result, the election is **void**.

---

### **10. Consequences of Failing the Medical Examination**

- If a contributor **fails** the medical examination (does not meet the criteria for passing), their election to count parliamentary service as pensionable service is **void**.
- The election is **not valid**, and no pensionable service is credited.

---

### **11. Financial Obligations Upon Election**

Contributors who make the election are required to pay specific amounts to various accounts, depending on whether they fall under **paragraph 3(b)** or not.

#### **Case A: Contributor to whom paragraph 3(b) applies**  
(Individuals who meet specific criteria, possibly involving health or service status)

- **To the Superannuation Account**:  
  Pay an amount equal to:  
  → The amount they elected to contribute under section 7 of the MPRA  
  **minus** the amount they actually paid under section 9 or 20 of the MPRA (as applicable).

- **To the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Account**:  
  Pay the **amount of any allowance** received under the MPRA for any period starting **after one year** of being a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act, **plus simple interest at 4% per annum**.

- **To the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Account**:  
  Pay the **amount of any supplementary retirement benefit** received under the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act for the same period (after one year), **plus simple interest at 4% per annum**.

> This ensures that the contributor does not benefit from both the MPRA allowance and the superannuation pension simultaneously.

#### **Case B: Contributor to whom paragraph 3(b) does not apply**  
(Standard contributors)

- Pay to the Superannuation Account based on:
  - **Paragraph 6(1)(e)** of the Public Service Superannuation Act, **if** the election is made within one year of becoming a contributor, or from **December 23, 1976**, whichever is later.
  - **Paragraph 6(1)(j)** of the Act, **if** the election is made at a later date.

> These are standard contribution formulas used in the Act to calculate pensionable service.

---

### **12. Transfer of Funds from MPRA Account**

Upon making the election, the following amounts are **transferred to the Superannuation Account**:

- All amounts previously paid to the **Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Account**  
  **minus** any withdrawals made under the MPRA (e.g., withdrawal allowances).

- All amounts **credited** to the MPRA account under **section 4 of the MPRA** (e.g., contributions or benefits credited to the account).

> This ensures that the financial history of the MPRA contributions is fully integrated into the superannuation system.

---

### **13. Payment Terms**

All amounts required under these regulations (except those specified in paragraph 8(a)) must be paid either:

- In a **lump sum** at the time of the election; **or**
- In **installments**, as prescribed by **section 5 of the Public Service Superannuation Regulations**.

> This provides flexibility in how the financial obligations are met.

---

### **14. Jurisdictional Reference Update**

Unless the context requires otherwise, every reference to **"Force"** in the English version of any Act of Parliament or instrument made under an Act (such as orders or regulations) is **replaced** with a reference to **"RCMP"** (Royal Canadian Mounted Police).

> This amendment ensures consistency in terminology, especially in legal documents where "Force" may be ambiguous.
