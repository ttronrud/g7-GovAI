### **Detailed Summary of the Certification of Origin of Goods Exported to a Free Trade Partner Regulations**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Background**

These regulations establish the procedures and requirements for issuing **certificates of origin** for goods exported from Canada to **free trade partners** under international trade agreements such as:

- **NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement)**  
- **CIFTA (Canada–Israel Free Trade Agreement)**  
- **CCFTA (Canada–Chile Free Trade Agreement)**  

The primary objective is to ensure that exporters can claim **preferential tariff treatment** under these agreements by verifying that goods meet the **rules of origin**—that is, they are sufficiently "produced" or "manufactured" within Canada or a designated country to qualify for reduced tariffs.

---

#### **2. Regulatory Basis and Legal Authority**

These regulations are **not required to be published under subsection 164(3) of the Customs Act** because:

- They **implement existing provisions** of free trade agreements (NAFTA, CIFTA, CCFTA).
- They **do not introduce any material substantive changes** to current customs rules.
- This conclusion is based on **paragraphs 164(4)(a.01)a and (d)** of the *Customs Act*, which allow certain regulations that merely implement existing agreements to be issued without publication in the *Canada Gazette*.

The regulations are made under the authority of:

- **Section 97.1(1)c** of the *Customs Act* (regarding the issuance of origin certificates)
- **Paragraphs 164(1)(i)d and (j)** of the *Customs Act* (regarding regulatory powers)
- **Subsections 164(1.1)e and (1.2)f** of the *Customs Act* (regarding regulation of origin certification)

These provisions grant the Minister of National Revenue, on the recommendation of the Governor General in Council, the power to issue such rules.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Customs Act* (the primary legislation governing customs procedures and trade rules). |
| **Producer** | A person who engages in any of the following activities: grows, mines, harvests, fishes, traps, hunts, manufactures, processes, or assembles a good. This definition is broad and includes both primary producers (e.g., farmers, miners) and manufacturers. |

#### **4. Who Must Complete and Sign the Certificate of Origin?**

Under **subsection 97.1(1)** of the *Customs Act*, when the **exporter is not the producer** of the goods, the certificate must be completed and signed by the **exporter**, based on one of the following three criteria:

1. **Exporter’s Knowledge**  
   The exporter must have **actual knowledge** that the goods meet the applicable rules of origin.

2. **Reasonable Reliance on Producer’s Written Representation**  
   The exporter must **reasonably rely** on a written statement from the producer confirming that the goods meet the rules of origin.

3. **Producer-Provided Certificate (for Specific Countries)**  
   For exports to certain countries, **the producer must voluntarily provide a certificate** stating that the goods meet the rules of origin.  
   This applies specifically to:
   - **Mexico**
   - **Chile**
   - **Costa Rica**
   - **Peru**
   - **Colombia**
   - **Panama**
   - **Honduras**

> ⚠️ **Note:** This third option is only available when the goods are being exported to these specific countries. It provides a mechanism for producers to self-certify, which simplifies compliance for exporters who are not directly involved in production.

#### **5. Language Requirements for Certificates**

The language of the certificate must be appropriate to the destination country to ensure clarity and acceptance by the importing country’s customs authorities:

| Destination Country / Region | Required Languages |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| **United States or EFTA states** | English or French |
| **Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Honduras** | English, French, or Spanish |
| **Israel or other CIFTA beneficiaries** | English, French, Hebrew, or Arabic |
| **Jordan** | English, French, or Arabic |

> This ensures that the certificate is **legally valid and understandable** in the target country’s official language(s), reducing the risk of rejection or non-acceptance.

---

#### **6. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the date that Section 44 of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 1997, c. 14)** comes into effect.

> As noted in the footnote:  
> **July 5, 1997** — This is the date when the regulations officially became effective.

---

#### **7. Repeal Clause**

The regulations include a **repeal clause** indicating that any previous rules superseded by this instrument are no longer in force. This ensures regulatory clarity and prevents conflicting or outdated provisions from being applied.

---

### **Key Implications and Practical Applications**

- **Simplifies Export Compliance**: By allowing exporters to rely on written statements from producers or to use a producer-provided certificate, the rules reduce administrative burden.
- **Supports Free Trade Agreements**: Ensures that Canadian goods can access preferential tariff treatment in partner countries by verifying origin compliance.
- **Promotes Transparency and Accountability**: Requires exporters to demonstrate knowledge or reasonable reliance on origin rules, preventing fraudulent claims.
- **Language Accessibility**: Ensures certificates are usable across diverse linguistic and cultural markets, especially in multilingual regions like Latin America and the Middle East.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Certification of Origin of Goods Exported to a Free Trade Partner Regulations* is a targeted, implementation-focused regulation designed to support Canada’s participation in key free trade agreements. It streamlines the origin certification process by:

- Clarifying who signs the certificate (exporter or producer),
- Establishing clear criteria for validity,
- Specifying language requirements,
- And ensuring compliance with rules of origin without introducing new or substantive changes.

These rules are **legally sound**, **operationally practical**, and **aligned with international trade standards**, making them an essential tool for Canadian exporters seeking preferential treatment in free trade markets.
