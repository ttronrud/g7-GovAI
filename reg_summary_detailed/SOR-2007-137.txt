**Detailed Summary of the Assisted Human Reproduction (Section 8 Consent) Regulations**  
*Issued under the Assisted Human Reproduction Act (S.C. 2004, c. 2), pursuant to subsection 65(1)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Assisted Human Reproduction (Section 8 Consent) Regulations* establish detailed procedural and ethical requirements for obtaining and managing **informed, written consent** from donors of human reproductive material (such as eggs, sperm, or embryos) and from third parties when such material is used to create or utilize in vitro embryos. These regulations apply specifically to **consent under Section 8** of the *Assisted Human Reproduction Act*, which governs the use of human reproductive material for creating embryos.

The regulations aim to ensure **transparency, informed decision-making, and ethical accountability** in assisted reproductive technologies, particularly in cases involving **third-party use**, **posthumous use**, **research**, and **anonymity**. They also define key terms, outline consent requirements, and specify how consent can be withdrawn or maintained over time.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**: Refers to the *Assisted Human Reproduction Act*.

2. **Common-law partner**: A person who cohabits with another in a conjugal relationship for at least one year. This definition excludes individuals who live separate and apart due to marital breakdown.

3. **Third party**:
   - In relation to human reproductive material: An individual who is neither the donor nor the spouse or common-law partner of the donor; or a couple where neither spouse or partner is the donor.
   - In relation to an in vitro embryo: An individual who is not the donor under subsection 10(1), or a couple where neither partner is the donor.

4. **Spouse**: Excludes individuals who live separate and apart from their spouse due to the breakdown of marriage.

> These definitions are critical in determining who qualifies as a "third party" and who has rights or responsibilities regarding consent.

---

## **Core Principles and Requirements**

### **1. Written Consent from the Donor**

- All consents must be **in writing** and **signed by the donor**.
- The consent must be **attested by a witness** to ensure authenticity and integrity.

> This ensures that the donor is fully aware of and voluntarily agrees to the use of their reproductive material.

---

## **Part 1: Consent for Use of Human Reproductive Material to Create an Embryo**

### **When Does This Apply?**
Applies to consent given under **subsection 8(1)** of the Act — the use of human reproductive material to create an embryo.

---

### **Mandatory Pre-Use Informed Consent Requirements**

Before using human reproductive material to create an embryo, the recipient must have a document signed by the donor stating that:

#### **The donor was informed in writing that the material will be used for one or more of the following purposes:**
- The donor’s own reproductive use  
- After the donor’s death, for the reproductive use of the donor’s spouse or common-law partner  
- For the reproductive use of a third party  
- To improve assisted reproduction procedures  
- To provide instruction in assisted reproduction procedures  

> This ensures donors are aware of the potential future uses of their material, including posthumous or research applications.

---

### **Special Provisions for Posthumous Use**

If the human reproductive material is to be **removed after the donor’s death**, it may only be used for:
- Reproductive use by the donor’s spouse or common-law partner  
- Improving assisted reproduction procedures  
- Providing instruction in assisted reproduction procedures  

> This limits post-death use to specific, non-commercial, and ethically sound purposes.

---

### **Withdrawal of Consent**

- Withdrawal must be **in writing**.
- It is **only effective** if the person intending to use the material is **notified in writing** of the withdrawal **before** the material is used or before the third party acknowledges receipt for reproductive use.

> Withdrawal timelines vary by purpose:
- For **donor’s own use**, **before use**.
- For **third-party reproductive use**, **before the third party acknowledges** the material is for their use or before removal/collection.
- For **research or procedural improvement**, withdrawal must occur **before thawing or initiation of the process**.

---

### **Excess Embryos and Use of Surplus**

- The number of embryos created can exceed immediate reproductive needs.
- **Excess embryos** must be used according to:
  - **Third party’s consent** (if used for their reproductive use)
  - **Donor’s consent** (if used for research, instruction, or improvement of procedures)

> This prevents unnecessary waste and ensures ethical handling of surplus embryos.

---

### **Special Case: Use by a Couple**

- If a couple uses material from one donor, and the couple later **separates or dissolves the relationship**, the individual who was the donor becomes the sole donor of the embryo under paragraph (1)(a).
- **Consent must be mutual** if the donor is a couple — both spouses or partners must agree to any use.

> This protects the rights of both individuals in a relationship and ensures that consent remains valid and shared.

---

### **Use for Research or Instruction**

- If the donor consents to use of material for **instruction or improvement of assisted reproduction procedures**, **no additional consent** is required to use the embryo for that purpose.

> This supports medical education and scientific advancement while respecting donor autonomy.

---

### **Anonymity Exception**

- If the donor donated under a condition of **anonymity**, the recipient may not obtain direct consent from the donor.
- Instead, they must have a document signed by the **person who originally obtained consent** from the donor, attesting that:
  - The donor was **informed in writing** of the purposes listed in section 3 (i.e., reproductive use, post-death use, research, etc.)
  - The donor **gave written consent** for the use of the material for the specified purposes
  - If applicable, the donor consented to surplus embryos being used for research, instruction, or improvement

> This preserves donor privacy while still ensuring informed consent and ethical oversight.

---

## **Part 2: Consent for Removal of Human Reproductive Material After Death**

### **When Does This Apply?**
Applies to consent under **subsection 8(2)** — removal of reproductive material from a donor’s body after death for embryo creation.

---

### **Mandatory Pre-Removal Informed Consent**

Before removal, the donor must have signed a document stating:
- The material will be used for one or more of the following purposes:
  - Reproductive use by spouse or common-law partner at time of death
  - Improving assisted reproduction procedures
  - Providing instruction in assisted reproduction procedures
- The donor must **withdraw consent in writing**, and this withdrawal is only effective if **notified in writing** to the person planning removal **before** removal occurs.

> This ensures that posthumous use is only authorized with clear, documented, and timely donor consent.

---

### **Dual Consent Requirement**

To legally remove reproductive material after death, the person must have:
1. **Written consent for removal**  
2. **Written consent for use** (as required under Part 1)

> This ensures both the removal and the intended use are ethically and legally justified.

---

## **Part 3: Consent for Use of an In Vitro Embryo**

### **When Does This Apply?**
Applies to consent under **subsection 8(3)** — the use of an in vitro embryo.

---

### **Mandatory Pre-Use Informed Consent**

Before using an embryo, the recipient must have a document signed by the donor stating:
- The embryo will be used for one or more of the following purposes:
  - Donor’s own reproductive use  
  - Third-party reproductive use  
  - Improving assisted reproduction procedures  
  - Providing instruction in assisted reproduction procedures  
  - A specific research project (with clearly stated goals)

> This ensures that the donor is fully informed about the embryo’s intended path.

---

### **Withdrawal of Consent**

Withdrawal must be **in writing** and is only effective **before**:
- For **donor’s own use**: before embryo use  
- For **third-party use**: before the third party acknowledges use  
- For **research or instruction**: before the **later of**:
  - The person acknowledges use  
  - The beginning of thawing or experimental process  
- For **research projects**: before the **latest of**:
  - Acknowledgment of research use  
  - Beginning of thawing  
  - Creation of a stem cell line

> This creates a clear timeline for withdrawal, preventing unauthorized or irreversible use.

---

### **Consent for Multiple Donors**

- If an embryo is created using material from **more than one individual**, the recipient must have:
  - Written consent from **each individual** whose material was used  
  - Or, if the donation was anonymous, a document attesting to their consent (as per section 4.1)

> This ensures that all contributing individuals have a voice in the embryo’s use.

---

### **Withdrawal by a Couple**

- If the donor is a couple, **either spouse or common-law partner** may withdraw consent.

> This provides flexibility while maintaining accountability.

---

### **Special Rule: Linking Donor Consent to Embryo Use**

- For embryos created from material intended for **research or instruction**, the consent provided under **sections 3, 4, and 4.1** (regarding use of reproductive material) is **considered valid** as consent for the embryo’s use.

> This streamlines compliance and reduces redundancy in documentation.
