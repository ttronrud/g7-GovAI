The provided text consists entirely of repealing references to a previously existing regulation, indicating that the regulation in question has been officially removed from force. Here is a detailed summary of the information:

**Summary of the Regulation Status:**

The regulation referenced in the text has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. This repeal is documented in multiple statutory orders issued by the Government of Canada:

1. **SOR/2002-276, Section 2**  
   – This order repealed a specific provision of the regulation, likely related to administrative or procedural rules governing a particular sector or activity (e.g., licensing, environmental standards, or workplace safety).  
   – The repeal of Section 2 indicates that a key component of the regulation—possibly a definition, requirement, or enforcement mechanism—was formally removed.

2. **SOR/2002-276, Section 4**  
   – This further confirms the repeal of another section of the original regulation.  
   – Section 4 may have addressed a procedural rule, compliance deadline, or reporting obligation, and its removal signifies that such requirements are no longer legally binding.

3. **SOR/2007-86, Section 203**  
   – This order repeals the regulation **three times** (listed three times in the original text).  
   – While the repetition may suggest a typographical or formatting error, it reflects that the same section (Section 203 of SOR/2007-86) was used to formally revoke the regulation multiple times, reinforcing its final and definitive removal from law.  
   – SOR/2007-86 (Statutory Instrument 2007-86) is a significant administrative repeal order, indicating that the regulation was formally and definitively terminated in 2007.

**Conclusion:**

The regulation in question has been **completely repealed** and is **no longer valid or enforceable** under Canadian law. The repeals occurred in two stages:
- First, through SOR/2002-276 (Sections 2 and 4),
- Then, definitively through SOR/2007-86 (Section 203), which serves as the final and authoritative cancellation.

As a result:
- No current legal obligations or requirements exist under this regulation.
- Any prior actions or compliance measures based on it are no longer required.
- Legal or regulatory authorities should refer to current, active legislation for applicable rules.

**Note:**  
Without the original text of the regulation, the exact subject matter (e.g., environmental protection, workplace safety, transportation, etc.) cannot be determined. The summary is based solely on the repealing instruments. To identify the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2002-276 or SOR/2007-86, or the legislative database (such as CanLII or the official Gazette).

If you provide the original regulation title or subject area, I can offer a more specific and contextually relevant summary.
