6. **Lending policies** (cash or securities).

### 🚫 **5. Prohibitions on Concentrated Investments**

- **Two or more affiliated corporations**.

#### ✅ Exceptions to the 10% Rule:

The restriction **does not apply** to:

2. **Securities issued or fully guaranteed by**:

   - Government of the United States or its agencies;
3. **Mortgage-backed securities funds** fully guaranteed by the federal or provincial government;

5. **Segregated funds, mutual funds, or pooled funds** that comply with the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985*.

> This allows strategic exposure to government-backed or index-based products without violating concentration limits.
