**Detailed Summary of the *Prisoner-of-War Status Determination Regulations* (1991)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Prisoner-of-War Status Determination Regulations*, made on **January 25, 1991**, under **section 8 of the Geneva Conventions Act**, establish a formal, structured legal framework for determining whether individuals detained by the **Canadian Forces** are entitled to **prisoner-of-war (POW) status** under international law. These regulations implement the obligations of Canada under the **Geneva Conventions of 1949**, particularly **Article 4** of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War and **Protocol I (1977)**, which provides enhanced protections for victims of international armed conflict.

The regulations ensure that POW status is determined in a **fair, transparent, and legally sound manner**, balancing the rights of detainees with operational and security concerns of the Canadian military.

---

## **Key Definitions**

- **Detainee**: A person in the custody of a Canadian Forces unit or element who has committed a *belligerent act* (i.e., an act of war or hostilities).
- **Non-commissioned member (NCO)**: As defined in section 2 of the *National Defence Act*; a military personnel member without commissioned rank.
- **Officer**: As defined in section 2 of the *National Defence Act*; a commissioned military rank.
- **Prisoner-of-war status**: Entitlement to POW protections under:
  - Article 4 of the **1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War**;
  - Or **Section II of Part III of Protocol I (1977)**, which expands protections in international armed conflicts.
- **Tribunal**: A specialized body established to determine whether a detainee qualifies for POW status.

## **Establishment of Tribunals**

### **Who Can Establish a Tribunal?**
The following authorities may establish a tribunal:
1. The **Minister of National Defence**;
2. The **Chief of the Defence Staff**;
3. An **officer commanding a command**;
4. An **officer commanding a formation**;
5. **Any other authority** prescribed or appointed by the Chief of the Defence Staff.

> This ensures a tiered, decentralized system where tribunals can be formed at appropriate levels of command, depending on the nature and scale of the detainee situation.

---

## **Composition of a Tribunal**

- A tribunal must consist of **one officer from the Legal Branch of the Canadian Forces**.
- This officer must be **appointed with the concurrence of the Judge Advocate General (JAG)**.
- The tribunal may not include the detainee or any member of the military who has a direct interest in the outcome.

> This ensures independence and legal expertise in the determination process.

---

## **Functions and Powers of a Tribunal**

### **1. Hearing Authority**
- A tribunal may hold a hearing to determine whether a detainee is entitled to POW status.

### **2. Evidence Collection Powers**
- May **order the appearance of any witness** subject to the *Code of Service Discipline* (i.e., Canadian Forces personnel).
- May **request the production of documentary or real evidence** under the control of the Canadian Forces.
- May **require witnesses to testify under oath or solemn affirmation**.

> These powers allow the tribunal to gather sufficient factual basis for its determination.

### **3. Limitation on Detainee Testimony**
- A detainee **cannot be compelled to testify** before the tribunal.
- This respects the detainee’s right to remain silent and protects against self-incrimination or coercion.

---

## **Initial Screening by Commanding Officers**

Every detainee must be **screened as soon as practicable** after being taken into custody by a unit or element of the Canadian Forces.

### **Screening Outcomes:**
1. **Clear entitlement to POW status** → The detainee is granted POW status.
2. **Doubt about entitlement** → The commanding officer must **request** a tribunal to hold a hearing.

> This initial screening ensures early identification of cases requiring formal adjudication.

### **Request for Tribunal Hearing**
- The request must be accompanied by a **summary of the information** that led to the doubt about POW status.
- The summary must clearly explain the basis for the uncertainty.

---

## **Review by Designated Authority**

The authority that establishes the tribunal (e.g., Minister, Chief of Defence Staff, etc.) reviews the request and may:

| Outcome | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Satisfied the detainee is entitled to POW status** | Directs the commanding officer to grant POW status. |
| **Satisfied the detainee is not entitled to POW status** | Directs the commanding officer not to grant POW status. |
| **In doubt about entitlement** | Directs a tribunal to hold a hearing and informs the commanding officer. |

> This step ensures that decisions are made by senior authorities with oversight and accountability.

---

## **Hearing Procedures**

When a tribunal is directed to hold a hearing, it follows a **structured and fair procedure**:

### **1. Hearing Begins**
- The direction to hold the hearing is read aloud.
- The detainee is asked if they need **additional time to prepare** — any reasonable request for adjournment is granted.

### **2. Presentation of Evidence**
- The **investigating member** presents all relevant evidence **without regard to whether it supports or contradicts** POW status.
- The detainee may then **present relevant evidence**.
- The tribunal may **recall witnesses or call additional witnesses** after evidence is presented.

### **3. Addresses to the Tribunal**
- First, the **investigating member** delivers an address.
- Then, the **detainee** delivers an address (if desired).

### **4. Determination**
After hearing all evidence and addresses, the tribunal makes one of two determinations:
- **If the evidence establishes on a balance of probabilities that the detainee is NOT entitled to POW status** → The detainee is **not** a POW.
- **In any other case** → The detainee **is entitled** to POW status.

> The standard of proof is **balance of probabilities**, a common standard in civil and military adjudication.

### **5. Notification and Right to Review**
- The tribunal **announces its determination**.
- Provides **written reasons** for the decision.
- Notifies the detainee of their **right to request a review** within **24 hours** of the announcement.

---

## **Procedural Flexibility**

- In cases not explicitly covered by the regulations, the tribunal may **determine its own procedures** to ensure fairness and effectiveness.

---

## **Confidential Hearings (In Camera)**

- A tribunal may hear evidence **in camera** (in private) and **in the absence of the detainee**, if it deems it necessary for **national security**.
- If such evidence is heard in camera, the tribunal must:
  - Provide the detainee with an **oral or written summary** of the evidence that would not be injurious to national security.

> This protects sensitive intelligence while maintaining transparency in non-injurious aspects.

---

## **Recording and Documentation**

The tribunal must:
- Keep **detailed minutes** of each hearing that include:
  - Copy of the direction to determine status;
  - Time, place, and names of persons present;
  - Summary of all witness testimony;
  - All real and documentary evidence considered;
  - The tribunal’s determination, reasons, and date/time of announcement.

> These minutes are **forwarded to the authority** that directed the tribunal.

---

## **Right to Request a Review**

A detainee who has been determined to have POW status may, **within 24 hours** of the tribunal’s announcement, request a **review** of the determination.

### **Review Process**
- The request must be **in writing** and submitted to the **commanding officer** of the unit holding the detainee.
- Within **seven days** of the announcement, the detainee may submit **written representations** to the commanding officer.
- The commanding officer forwards both the request and representations to the **authority** that directed the tribunal.

### **Review by Authority**
The authority may:
1. **Substitute** its own determination (e.g., if it believes the tribunal erred);
2. **Set aside** the tribunal’s decision and **order a new hearing**;
3. **Confirm** the tribunal’s determination.

> The authority must provide **written reasons** for its decision.

> This review mechanism ensures **accountability and appeal**, allowing for correction of potential errors.

## **Right to Legal Representation**

- A detainee has the right to be represented by an **assisting member**.
- The assisting member is appointed by or under the authority of the **commanding officer**.
- Appointment may be requested by the detainee, though **exigencies of service** may limit availability.
- The assisting member may:
  - Assist in preparing for the hearing;
  - Represent the detainee during the hearing;
  - Assist in preparing written representations for a review.

> The regulations **do not restrict** the detainee’s right to additional representation in appropriate circumstances.

---

## **Language and Interpretation Rights**

- A detainee who does **not understand the language** of the hearing has the right to:
  - A **qualified interpreter** to assist in preparation and participation;
  - To make **written representations** to the reviewing authority if a review is requested.

> This ensures access to justice and participation regardless of language barriers.
