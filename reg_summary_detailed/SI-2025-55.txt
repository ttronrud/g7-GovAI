**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2025-85 and Designation of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as Minister under the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under the authority granted by subsection 2(1) of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (R.S., c. E-3).

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2025-85 (February 12, 2025):**  
   The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2025-85, which was issued on February 12, 2025. This order had previously established or designated a different individual or mechanism for the appointment of a Minister responsible for the administration of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act*. By repealing this order, the Government is effectively removing the prior designation or procedural framework that governed the appointment of a Minister under this Act.

2. **Designation of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as Minister:**  
   The regulation designates the **Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** (i.e., the Prime Minister) as the **Minister** responsible for the purposes of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act*.  
   
   This designation is made under **subsection 2(1)** of the Act, which defines who constitutes the "Minister" for the purposes of overseeing electoral boundary readjustment processes. This provision typically empowers the Minister to direct, approve, or oversee the administrative and procedural aspects of boundary reviews and adjustments.

3. **Legal Basis:**  
   The authority to make this designation stems from the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act*, specifically subsection 2(1), which provides that the Minister for the purposes of the Act is the person designated by the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This ensures that the Minister responsible for electoral boundaries is a senior and accountable figure in the Government.

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Clarity in Governance:** This regulation clarifies the administrative responsibility for electoral boundary adjustments by formally assigning the role to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. This ensures that the Prime Minister, as the head of government, has direct oversight of the process, which is critical given the political and democratic implications of boundary changes.

- **Succession and Continuity:** By repealing the prior Order (P.C. 2025-85), the Government removes any ambiguity or outdated arrangements that may have been in place. This allows for a clean, current designation aligned with the current government structure.

- **Political Accountability:** Assigning the role to the Prime Minister reinforces accountability, as the Minister responsible for electoral boundaries is directly accountable to Parliament and the public for decisions that affect electoral representation.

- **Procedural Efficiency:** The designation streamlines the process by eliminating the need for separate or interim appointments or orders, ensuring that the readjustment process can proceed efficiently under the leadership of the Prime Minister.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulation is effective immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette and comes into force on the date of its issuance (implied by the context of the Order in Council, which would typically be published shortly after the Governor General's formal action).

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a formal and legally binding update to the administrative structure of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act*. It removes an outdated designation and establishes the Prime Minister (as Leader of the Government in the House of Commons) as the designated Minister for the Act, ensuring that the process of reviewing and adjusting electoral boundaries is conducted under the leadership of the head of government. This action strengthens governance, accountability, and transparency in the electoral system.
