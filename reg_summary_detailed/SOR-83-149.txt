- The regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendations of:
  - The **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**
  - The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**
  - The **Treasury Board**
- It is made under **Section 12 of the Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act (Act)**, which grants the government the authority to establish rules governing oil and gas operations on Crown lands in Canada.
- The regulation was preceded by a **public notice** published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **May 8, 1982**, providing interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to submit comments or representations before the final regulations were adopted.

#### **2. Regulation Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled:  
  **Canada Oil and Gas Operations Regulations**  
- It may be cited as: **Canada Oil and Gas Operations Regulations**.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulation introduces or clarifies key terms used throughout:
- **"Act"** refers to the *Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act* (Loi).
- **"Operating Licence"** means a licence issued under **Section 3.2 of the Act**.  
  This licence authorizes individuals or corporations to carry out oil and gas exploration, development, or production activities on Crown land.

  - Entitled to carry on business in **any province of Canada**.

> *Note:* This establishes a broad but legally defined eligibility framework, ensuring that both individuals and legally recognized businesses can participate in oil and gas operations.

---

#### **5. Requirements for Submitting an Application**
Every application for an operating licence must:
- Be submitted in **writing**.
- Include:
  - The **full name** and **complete address** of the applicant.
- Be **forwarded to the Chief Conservation Officer** (the designated government official responsible for overseeing conservation and environmental protection).

- Any other work or activity **required by the Act to be authorized**

**Authorization must be obtained in one of two ways:**
1. **Expressly authorized** under **regulations made under the Act**, or  
2. **Written authorization** under **paragraph 3.2(1)(b) of the Act**.

> *Key Implication:* This establishes a strict regulatory framework for technical and environmental work. It prevents unapproved exploration or environmental assessments, which could lead to ecological damage or non-compliance with conservation standards.

### **Conclusion**
The *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Regulations* (1982) provide a comprehensive, enforceable, and transparent framework for managing oil and gas operations on Canadian Crown lands. By defining eligibility, setting strict procedural and authorization requirements, and emphasizing environmental protection and accountability, the regulations serve as a critical tool for balancing economic development with environmental stewardship.
