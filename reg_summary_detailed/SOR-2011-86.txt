### **Detailed Summary of the Fort William First Nation Sawmill Regulations (S.C. 2005, c. 53)**

The **Fort William First Nation Sawmill Regulations**, enacted under the *First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act*, are a set of administrative rules governing the development, operation, and regulation of a sawmill project on specific lands within the Fort William Indian Reserve No. 52 in Ontario. These regulations were established following a formal request by the Fort William First Nation Council and through a collaborative agreement between the Government of Canada, the Province of Ontario, and the First Nation.

This detailed summary breaks down the key components, legal framework, scope, exclusions, and operational provisions of the regulations.

  This agreement assigns **provincial authorities** (e.g., environmental agencies, enforcement bodies) the responsibility for **administering and enforcing** the regulations on the project lands.
