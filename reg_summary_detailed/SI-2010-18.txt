The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2014-38, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially cancelled and no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: Statutory Instrument 2014-38 (SI/2014-38), specifically **Section 5** of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect as part of the legislative process in 2014, with SI/2014-38 being made that year.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 5 of SI/2014-38 explicitly removes or cancels the previously enacted regulation. This means that the content of the regulation no longer applies, and any legal effect it previously had is nullified.
- **Implication**: Any reference to this regulation in legal, administrative, or operational contexts is now outdated and invalid. Authorities, courts, or individuals relying on it would need to consult current, active legislation.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries ("[Repealed, SI/2014-38, s. 5]") suggest that this information may have been copied or formatted incorrectly in the original source, possibly due to a technical or editorial error. However, the consistent message across all instances is the same: the regulation is **no longer valid**.
- The specific details of the original regulation (e.g., subject matter, scope, provisions) are **not provided** in the text, so a full substantive summary of its content cannot be given. To reconstruct its original purpose, one would need to refer to the prior version of the regulation or related legislative history.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **fully repealed** by **Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2014-38**. It is **no longer in force** and should not be relied upon in any legal or regulatory context. The repealing instrument confirms its invalidation, and any further use of the regulation would be legally incorrect.
