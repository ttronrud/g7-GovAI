**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Order*, made under the authority of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* (now referred to as the *Natural Products Marketing Act*), grants the **Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Development Board (the "Board")** the power to regulate the **marketing of pulse crops** in **interprovincial and export trade**. This regulation specifically applies to pulse crops grown within the province of Saskatchewan.

The Order was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, pursuant to **Section 2** of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*, and came into force on **April 1, 1984** (as cited in S.C. 1984, c. 40, s. 4). It may be cited as the *Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Order*.

### **Key Definitions**

The Order establishes the following key definitions to clarify its scope and application:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act* of Saskatchewan, which provides the legal framework for regulating the marketing of agricultural products, including pulses.
  
- **Board**: The *Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Development Board*, established under the Act. The Board is responsible for overseeing the development, promotion, and regulation of pulse crop markets.

- **Plan**: The *Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Development Plan*, established under the Act. This plan outlines strategic goals, objectives, and policies for the growth and sustainable marketing of pulse crops. Any regulations made under the Act to implement or interpret this plan are also included.

- **Pulse**: Defined as the edible seeds of the following legumes:
  - Peas
  - Beans (including fababeans)
  - Chickpeas
  - Broad beans
  - Lentils  
  *(Note: "Pulse" in this context refers to dried, edible seeds, not the plants themselves.)*

- **Sale**: Includes any transaction involving the sale of pulse crops, whether for cash, barter, or future delivery. This broad definition ensures that all forms of commercial exchange are covered under the regulatory framework.

### **Core Powers Granted to the Board**

The Board is authorized to regulate the **marketing of pulse crops** in two key markets:

1. **Interprovincial Trade** – Sales of pulse crops between provinces.
2. **Export Trade** – Sales of pulse crops to foreign countries.

This regulatory authority extends to the same powers the Board already has over **local marketing** of pulse crops within Saskatchewan under the Act and the Plan.

### **Specific Regulatory Powers Under Section 3**

With respect to interprovincial and export trade, the Board may:

#### **(a) Fix and Impose Levies or Charges**

- The Board may, by **order**, **establish and impose levies or charges** on individuals or entities engaged in:
  - The **production** of pulse crops
  - The **marketing** of pulse crops
  - Who are **situated in Saskatchewan**

- These levies or charges may be **classified into different groups** based on factors such as:
  - Type of operation (e.g., small farm vs. large producer)
  - Volume of production
  - Marketing channel (e.g., direct to market, through intermediaries)

- The Board may **set different levies or charges** for different groups, allowing for differentiated financial obligations based on the nature or scale of operations.

> *Example*: A small-scale farmer may pay a lower levy than a large cooperative or exporter.

#### **(b) Use of Collected Levies and Charges**

The funds collected from these levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to ensure financial stability during market downturns)
- **Payment of expenses** related to the administration and promotion of the pulse crop sector
- **Reimbursement of losses** incurred due to:
  - Poor market prices
  - Unfavorable weather
  - Market disruptions
- **Equalization or adjustment of monies** among producers
  - This means that if some producers receive higher returns from sales than others, the Board can use collected funds to **distribute financial support** to those who have lower returns.
  - This promotes **fairness and equity** among producers, especially in volatile markets.

> *Purpose*: To stabilize income for producers, reduce price volatility, and support long-term sustainability in the pulse crop industry.

---

### **Policy Objectives and Implications**

This Order supports broader goals of:

- **Market stability** in pulse crop trade
- **Fair return to producers**, especially in times of fluctuating international or interprovincial prices
- **Development of a coordinated, efficient, and sustainable pulse crop industry** in Saskatchewan
- **Promotion of Saskatchewan pulse crops** as a competitive and reliable export product

By enabling the Board to collect and manage levies, the Order allows for **financial mechanisms** that help mitigate the risks associated with price volatility and market uncertainty in both domestic and international trade.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The Order is made under **Section 2** of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* (now the *Natural Products Marketing Act*), which empowers the Governor in Council to issue orders regulating the marketing of agricultural products.
- The Board’s authority is derived from the Act and its associated *Development Plan*, ensuring that regulatory actions are aligned with strategic agricultural policy.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Order* is a foundational regulatory instrument that enables the **Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Development Board** to manage and stabilize the interprovincial and export marketing of pulse crops. By allowing the Board to:

- Impose tiered levies on producers and marketers
- Use collected funds to create reserves, cover losses, and equalize returns

...the Order ensures that producers are protected from market volatility and that the overall pulse crop industry remains viable, competitive, and equitable.

This regulation plays a crucial role in supporting Saskatchewan’s agricultural economy, particularly in a sector that is sensitive to global demand, price fluctuations, and supply chain dynamics.

**Note**: While the Order is dated 1984, it remains relevant today due to the continued importance of pulses (such as lentils and chickpeas) in Saskatchewan’s agriculture and export economy. It may be amended or supplemented by subsequent regulations under the *Natural Products Marketing Act* to reflect changing market conditions or policy priorities.
