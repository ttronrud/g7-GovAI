**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Egg Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Ontario Egg Order* and may be cited as such. This Order establishes the legal framework governing the marketing of eggs in Ontario, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency in its application:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (French: *Loi*). This is the primary legislation under which the regulatory bodies operate.
  
- **Board**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario* (French: *Régie*). This body has broad authority over the marketing of farm products, including eggs, both within Ontario and in interprovincial and export markets.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to *The Ontario Egg and Fowl Producers’ Marketing Board* (French: *Office de commercialisation*). This is a specialized body established under the Act to oversee the marketing of eggs and poultry products.

- **Eggs**: Defined as *any eggs of a domestic hen produced in the Province of Ontario* (French: *oeufs*). This definition excludes eggs from other sources (e.g., non-domestic birds or imported eggs).

- **Plan**: Refers to *any plan for the marketing of eggs* established and amended over time under the authority of the Act. The Plan sets out rules and procedures for egg marketing, including pricing, distribution, and market access.

**3. Regulatory Authority – Powers of the Board and Commodity Board**  
Both the **Board** and the **Commodity Board** are granted significant regulatory powers in relation to the marketing of eggs. Specifically:

- They may regulate the **interprovincial and export trade** of eggs.
- With respect to persons and property located within Ontario, they may exercise **all or any powers** that they would have in regulating egg marketing *within* the province. This means their authority extends beyond domestic sales to include oversight over how eggs are marketed outside Ontario, including in national and international markets.

This provision ensures consistency in regulation—whether eggs are sold locally or exported—by allowing the boards to apply the same rules and enforcement mechanisms across all markets.

**4. Specific Authority of the Commodity Board (Relevant to Interprovincial and Export Trade)**  
Although a prior section (previously in effect) has been **repealed** (SOR/80-90), the current provision grants the Commodity Board specific powers related to **levies and charges** in interprovincial and export marketing.

#### Key Powers:
- **Fixing, Imposing, and Collecting Levies or Charges**:
  - The Commodity Board can establish, set, and collect fees or charges from individuals or entities engaged in the **marketing of eggs** in interprovincial and export markets.
  - These persons must be those specifically described in *section 3 of the Act*—typically egg dealers, distributors, processors, or exporters.

- **Classification of Marketers into Groups**:
  - The Commodity Board may **classify** these marketing entities into different groups (e.g., small retailers, large exporters, wholesalers).
  - Each group may be assigned a **different levy or charge**, based on factors such as volume of sales, market role, or business size.

- **Use of Levies and Charges**:
  - The collected levies and charges may be used for several purposes, including:
    - **Creating reserves** (funds set aside for future use, e.g., during market downturns).
    - **Covering expenses and losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of eggs (e.g., losses from price drops or spoilage).
    - **Equalizing or adjusting payments** among egg producers.
      - This ensures that producers who experience lower returns due to market fluctuations can be compensated.
      - The adjustment can be made over **periods of time** as the Commodity Board determines—providing flexibility in response to market conditions.

---

**5. Purpose and Impact**  
The core objective of this regulation is to:

- Ensure **stable and fair marketing conditions** for egg producers in Ontario.
- Provide **financial safeguards** through levies that help manage market volatility.
- Promote **equitable distribution of profits** among producers, especially during periods of low prices or poor market conditions.
- Support the **long-term sustainability** of the egg industry by enabling the Commodity Board to manage risk and fund critical operations.

---

**6. Important Notes**  
- The repeal of the prior provision (SOR/80-90) indicates a **restructuring or modernization** of the levy system, removing outdated or ineffective mechanisms.
- The current system emphasizes **group-based levies**, which allow for more targeted and equitable financial obligations based on market activity.
- The use of collected funds for **losses and equalization** is critical in protecting small producers who may be disproportionately affected by market fluctuations.

**Conclusion**  
The *Ontario Egg Order* empowers the Ontario Egg and Fowl Producers’ Marketing Board to regulate the marketing of domestic hen eggs in interprovincial and export markets. It allows the Board to impose tiered levies based on the type and scale of marketing activity, with collected funds used to stabilize the industry, cover losses, and ensure fair compensation among producers. This regulatory framework supports market stability, protects producers from price volatility, and ensures that the egg industry remains viable and sustainable in both domestic and international markets.
