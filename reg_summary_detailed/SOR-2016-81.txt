**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Northern Madtom (Noturus stigmosus) Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically **Part 2 of Schedule 1**, which designates certain wildlife species as endangered and requires the identification and protection of their critical habitat. The legislation, enacted as **S.C. 2002, c. 29**, provides the legal framework for the conservation of species at risk in Canada.

---

**2. Species at Risk**  
The species in question is the **Northern Madtom (*Noturus stigmosus*)**, a small freshwater fish native to certain regions of eastern Canada. It is officially listed as an **endangered species** under SARA, meaning it faces a high risk of extinction in the wild and requires immediate conservation action.

---

**3. Critical Habitat Designation**  
The critical habitat for the Northern Madtom has been formally identified in its **recovery strategy**, which was officially incorporated into the **Species at Risk Public Registry**. This registry is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada that documents the status, recovery plans, and critical habitat for species at risk.

The critical habitat identified in this Order is the specific geographic areas essential for the survival and recovery of the Northern Madtom. These areas are defined by their ecological characteristics—such as water quality, substrate type, flow conditions, and vegetation—that support the species’ life cycle (e.g., spawning, feeding, shelter).

---

**4. Compliance with SARA Provisions**  
- **Subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Northern Madtom. This means that the government is legally obligated to protect and manage the identified critical habitat to ensure the species’ survival.  
- The Order is made **pursuant to subsections 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA.  
  - **Section 58(4)** authorizes the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate critical habitat when it is necessary for the recovery of a listed species.  
  - **Section 58(5)** requires that such designations be made in a manner that ensures the habitat is protected from harmful activities and development.

---

**5. Exclusion from Prohibited Areas (Subsection 58(2))**  
A key provision in the Order is that **no portion of the designated critical habitat falls within a place referred to in subsection 58(2) of SARA**. This subsection typically refers to areas that are protected under other federal or provincial laws (such as national parks, reserves, or other lands set aside for public or Indigenous use). By confirming that the critical habitat is not located in such a restricted zone, the government ensures that the designation does not override or conflict with existing protected areas.

---

**6. Consultation with Indigenous Communities**  
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has determined that **the annexed Order may affect lands set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation (band)**. In accordance with **subsection 58(7)** of SARA, which mandates consultation with Indigenous communities when critical habitat designations could impact their traditional lands or uses, the Minister has:

- Consulted with the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND)**  
- Consulted directly with the **relevant First Nation band**

This process ensures that Indigenous rights, interests, and traditional uses are respected and considered in the management of the critical habitat.

---

**7. Legal Effect and Enforcement**  
- The Order is **formally published and registered** in the *Canada Gazette*, and it **comes into force on the day of registration** (April 21, 2016, in this case).  
- Once in force, the designated critical habitat becomes legally protected under SARA.  
- Any activity that would destroy, degrade, or otherwise interfere with the critical habitat is prohibited without the Minister’s authorization, unless it is carried out under a permit that meets strict environmental and recovery criteria.

---

**8. Purpose and Significance**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- Provide legal protection for the specific environments essential to the Northern Madtom’s survival.  
- Support the species’ recovery by preventing harmful development, pollution, or habitat alteration.  
- Strengthen the implementation of the recovery strategy through concrete, enforceable actions.  
- Promote intergovernmental and intercultural cooperation—particularly with Indigenous communities—by respecting traditional land use and governance.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a key step in the conservation of the endangered Northern Madtom. By formally designating its critical habitat, the Government of Canada ensures that the species has the necessary environmental conditions to survive and recover. The process adheres to SARA’s requirements for scientific rigor, legal compliance, and meaningful consultation with Indigenous peoples, reflecting a balanced and inclusive approach to species conservation.
