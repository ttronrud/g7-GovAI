**Detailed Summary of the Merchant Seamen Compensation Order, 1992**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation, formally titled *The Merchant Seamen Compensation Order, 1992*, was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, pursuant to **Section 35 of the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act (MSCA)**. Its primary purpose is to **revise and update the compensation amounts and maximum rate of earnings** payable to merchant seamen and their dependants in the event of work-related accidents or injuries.

The order was enacted to ensure that the compensation provided under the MSCA **does not exceed the highest equivalent amounts or maximum rates of earnings** currently established by the provincial legislatures of **Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland**—specifically those relating to workers’ compensation and benefits for dependants. This ensures alignment with provincial standards and prevents overcompensation relative to existing worker protection frameworks.

The 1986 Order (P.C. 1986-1051) was formally **revoked**, and this 1992 Order replaces it as the current governing regulation.

### **Significance of the Changes**

1. **Alignment with Provincial Standards**:
   - The amendments ensure that the compensation provided to merchant seamen and their dependants does not surpass the highest compensation levels set by the four Atlantic provinces. This promotes fairness and consistency across jurisdictions.

2. **Improved Financial Support**:
   - The increases—especially in death benefits, child benefits, and monthly payments—enhance the financial security of seamen’s families, particularly in cases of death or long-term injury.

3. **Modernization of Compensation Framework**:
   - The 1992 Order modernizes the compensation structure by updating figures that had not been adjusted since 1986, reflecting inflation and changes in living costs.

4. **Clarity and Structure**:
   - The revised amounts are clearly defined and categorized (e.g., death benefits, child benefits, medical reimbursements), making the compensation process more transparent and easier to administer.

### **Legal Authority and Process**
