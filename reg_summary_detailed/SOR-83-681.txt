**Detailed Summary of the Excise Tax Indexing Ratio Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The *Excise Tax Indexing Ratio Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of National Revenue**. This action is grounded in specific provisions of the *Excise Tax Act*:

- **Clause 24(2)(b)(i)(B)** of the Excise Tax Act — governs the indexing of excise taxes on **wines, cigarettes, and manufactured tobacco**.
- **Clause 3(b)(i)(B)** of Schedule II to the Excise Tax Act — governs the indexing of excise tax rates listed in **Schedule II** (which includes specific tax rates on certain goods, including tobacco and alcohol products).

These regulations provide the **indexing ratios** used to adjust excise tax rates to account for inflation or changes in the cost of living, ensuring that tax levels remain aligned with economic conditions.

**Regulatory Title:**

The regulations are officially titled the **Excise Tax Indexing Ratio Regulations** and may be cited as such (S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 68, s. 7 and s. 27).

---

**Purpose of the Regulations:**

The primary purpose is to **adjust excise tax rates** on key consumer goods — specifically **wines, cigarettes, and manufactured tobacco** — in response to economic changes. This adjustment is done through a **multiplicative index factor** applied to the base indexing ratio established by law.

This ensures that tax rates are periodically updated to reflect changes in the cost of living or inflation, maintaining fairness and economic relevance in taxation.

**Key Provisions:**

### 1. Adjustment of Excise Taxes under Subsection 24(1) of the Excise Tax Act (Wines, Cigarettes, Manufactured Tobacco)

This applies to excise taxes imposed on **wines, cigarettes, and manufactured tobacco** under the general excise tax framework.

- The **base indexing ratio** (determined by clause 24(2)(b)(i)(B)) is adjusted by **multiplying it** by:
  - **1.35559** — effective on **September 1, 1983**
  - **1.99924** — effective on **September 1, 1984**

> **Interpretation:**  
> This means that the original tax rate index is increased by a factor of 1.35559 in 1983 and 1.99924 in 1984.  
> For example, if the base ratio was 1.00, the adjusted ratio would become:
> - 1.35559 in 1983 → a 35.56% increase
> - 1.99924 in 1984 → a 99.92% increase (nearly a doubling)

This reflects a significant upward adjustment in tax rates, likely in response to rising inflation or economic pressures during that period.

### 2. Adjustment of Excise Tax Rates in Schedule II (Specific Goods)

This applies to **specific excise tax rates** listed in **Section 1 of Schedule II** to the Excise Tax Act — typically including specific rates on tobacco products and other excisable goods.

- The base indexing ratio (under clause 3(b)(i)(B)) is adjusted by multiplying it by:
  - **1.37078** — effective on **September 1, 1983**
  - **1.88464** — effective on **September 1, 1984**

> **Interpretation:**
> - 1.37078 → approximately a 37.08% increase in 1983
> - 1.88464 → approximately an 88.46% increase in 1984

These adjustments are slightly higher than those for general excise taxes, indicating a more substantial increase in tax rates on specific goods, possibly due to their higher societal or fiscal importance.

---

**Effective Dates:**

All adjustments take effect on **September 1, 1983**, and again on **September 1, 1984**. These dates mark the beginning of new fiscal periods during which the updated indexing ratios are applied to calculate excise tax obligations.

---

**Significance and Context:**

- These regulations were introduced during a period of **economic inflation** in Canada in the early 1980s, which prompted the government to revise excise tax rates to maintain fiscal stability and ensure that tax revenues reflect current economic conditions.
- The use of **multipliers** (e.g., 1.35559, 1.88464) indicates a **non-linear, inflation-adjusted** approach to tax rate changes — not a flat percentage increase.
- The differences between the two sets of multipliers (wines/cigarettes vs. Schedule II items) suggest that **different goods may have different sensitivity to inflation or policy priorities**.

---

**Legal Status and Application:**

- The regulations are **binding** and enforceable under the Excise Tax Act.
- They serve as **operational tools** for tax authorities to calculate and apply excise tax rates on relevant goods.
- The adjustments are **automatic and mandatory**, meaning that any tax calculation must incorporate the appropriate multiplier for the date in question.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Excise Tax Indexing Ratio Regulations* provide a formal, legally authorized mechanism for adjusting excise tax rates on **cigarettes, wines, and manufactured tobacco** in response to inflation. By applying specific multipliers on **September 1, 1983**, and **September 1, 1984**, the government ensured that tax rates were updated to reflect economic changes. The higher multiplier for Schedule II items indicates a more aggressive adjustment for certain goods, possibly reflecting policy goals such as public health or revenue maximization.

These regulations represent a key example of **economic indexing in taxation**, balancing fiscal responsibility with the need to maintain tax equity and relevance in a changing economy.
