**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (Subsection 4(1) and Paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security and Safety, International Relations and National Defence), No. 2002-2**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
This regulation, formally titled the *Radiocommunication Act (Subsection 4(1) and Paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security and Safety, International Relations and National Defence), No. 2002-2*, was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**. 

The primary objective of this Order is to **grant temporary exemptions** from specific provisions of the Radiocommunication Act to enable authorized government entities—specifically the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** and the **Canadian Forces**—to conduct **intentional interference or obstruction of radiocommunications** for **security, safety, international relations, or national defence purposes**.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**
- The Order is authorized under:
  - **Subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**, which allows for exemptions when necessary for national security, safety, or defence.
  - The Act itself (referred to as "Act") establishes the regulatory framework governing radio communications in Canada, including rules about interference and spectrum use.

---

### **3. Scope of Exemption**

#### **a. Exemption Under Section 1 (Subsection 4(1) and Paragraph 9(1)(b))**
- The exemption applies to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, as represented by:
  - The **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**
  - The **Canadian Forces**
- These entities are **exempt from the application of**:
  - **Subsection 4(1)** of the Radiocommunication Act (which normally prohibits intentional interference with radiocommunications)
  - **Paragraph 9(1)(b)** of the Act (which prohibits interference with communications that are essential to public safety or national interests)

#### **b. Time Period**
- The exemption is **temporary and limited** to:
  - **From July 16, 2002, to July 31, 2002** (a period of 16 days)

> This short duration suggests a targeted, emergency or situational use rather than a long-term or routine policy.

---

### **4. Geographical Limitation**
- The exemption is **geographically restricted** to a specific area within **Ontario** defined by a quadrilateral bounded by the following coordinates:
  - 43°30′N; 79°15′W  
  - 43°30′N; 79°45′W  
  - 44°45′N; 79°15′W  
  - 44°45′N; 79°45′W  

This area represents a **defined region in central Ontario**, likely encompassing parts of:
- **Northwestern Ontario**
- Possibly including areas near **Sault Ste. Marie**, **Windsor**, or **Kitchener**, depending on the exact shape.

> The restriction ensures that the interference does not extend beyond a necessary operational zone, minimizing disruption to the broader Canadian communications network.

---

### **5. Conditions for Use of Exemption**

#### **a. Section 2 – Exemption for Interference with Radiocommunications (Subsection 4(1))**
- The exemption under subsection 4(1) applies **only if**:
  - The radio apparatus is used to **interfere with or obstruct a radiocommunication**
  - Such interference is conducted **in accordance with subsection 4(2)** of the Act
  - The purpose is **one of the following**:
    - **Security**
    - **Safety**
    - **International relations**
    - **National defence**

> This ensures that interference is not used arbitrarily or for non-essential purposes.

#### **b. Section 2 – Exemption for Interference with Radiocommunications (Paragraph 9(1)(b))**
- The exemption under paragraph 9(1)(b) applies **only if**:
  - The radiocommunication is interfered with or obstructed **for the purpose of**:
    - Security
    - Safety
    - International relations
    - National defence

> This reinforces that all interference must serve a legitimate and high-level national interest.

---

### **6. Principle of Minimization**
- A key requirement established in the Order is that:
  > *"Every reasonable effort shall be made to confine or restrict to the extent possible interference with or obstruction of a radiocommunication referred to in subsection (1) to the smallest physical area, the fewest number of frequencies and the minimum duration required to accomplish the objectives of the interference or obstruction."*

This principle emphasizes:
- **Proportionality** – Interference should be as narrow and brief as possible.
- **Necessity** – Only the essential elements of frequency, time, and geographic scope should be used.
- **Minimizing collateral impact** – Preventing disruption to civilian or public services outside the targeted area.

---

### **7. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government (typically published in the Canada Gazette).

> This ensures that the exemption is legally active only after formal registration and publication, providing transparency and legal certainty.

### **8. Key Legal and Policy Implications**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| **Temporary Nature** | Indicates a reactive or emergency-based use, not a permanent policy shift. |
| **Limited Geographic Scope** | Prevents widespread disruption and protects broader public communication networks. |
| **Strict Purpose Limitations** | Ensures interference is only used in cases of national security, safety, or defence. |
| **Proportionality Requirement** | Balances national security needs with the protection of public communication rights. |
| **Government Accountability** | Requires the RCMP and Canadian Forces to justify and document their actions under this exemption. |

---

### **9. Conclusion**
This exemption order is a **targeted, time-bound, and geographically limited** legal mechanism that allows Canadian security and defence agencies to **intentionally interfere with radio communications** in a specific Ontario region during a short window in July 2002—**only when necessary and for legitimate national security, safety, or defence reasons**.

It reflects a balance between:
- The **need for operational flexibility** in high-risk or emergency situations
- The **protection of the public communications infrastructure** under Canadian law

It also underscores the principle that **even when interference is permitted, it must be minimal, justified, and strictly limited in scope** to avoid undue harm to civilian or commercial radio services.

---

### **Note on Historical Context**
This Order (No. 2002-2) appears to be a **one-time or situational exemption**, likely issued in response to a specific incident or operational requirement involving national security or emergency preparedness. Such temporary exemptions are common in national security frameworks and are subject to review and renewal if needed in future scenarios.

✅ **Final Summary Statement**:  
*The Radiocommunication Act Exemption Order No. 2002-2 grants the RCMP and Canadian Forces temporary, geographically limited, and purpose-specific authority to interfere with radio communications in central Ontario during July 16–31, 2002, solely for security, safety, international relations, or national defence. The use of such interference is strictly limited in scope, duration, and frequency, and must be proportionate to the objective, ensuring minimal disruption to the broader communications environment.*
