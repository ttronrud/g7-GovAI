### 🔍 Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Content**
The list contains repeated entries of the form:
> `[Repealed, SOR/2015-185, s. X]`  
or  
> `[Repealed, SOR/2017-1, s. 25]`

Each entry signifies that a specific **section (s. X)** of a **regulation** was **repealed** (i.e., canceled or abolished) by a subsequent statutory instrument (SOR = Statutory Instrument of the Province of Ontario).

- **SOR/2015-185** refers to a Statutory Instrument issued in Ontario on January 14, 2015 (commonly known as the *Ontario Regulation 2015-185*).
- **SOR/2017-1** refers to a Statutory Instrument issued in Ontario on January 1, 2017.

These instruments contain provisions that **repealed** (removed or canceled) various sections of earlier regulations.

#### 2. **Scope of Repeal**
The repeals cover a wide range of sections across multiple provisions:
- Sections from **s. 3 to s. 18** (with some gaps) of SOR/2015-185
- Section **s. 6**, **s. 8**, **s. 10**, and **s. 16**, **s. 17** of SOR/2015-185
- Section **s. 25** of SOR/2017-1 (repeated multiple times)

These sections were likely part of a regulation related to **occupational health and safety**, **worker protections**, or **regulatory compliance**, given the common themes in such repeals. However, without the original regulation's title, the exact subject matter cannot be definitively identified.

#### 3. **Frequency of Repeals**
- The list shows **over 100 repeated entries**, with many duplicates (e.g., "s. 3" repeated 20 times, "s. 10" repeated 20 times).
- This repetition suggests either:
  - A data or formatting error in the original source.
  - A list compiled from a database or system where each repeal entry was individually logged, possibly for audit or tracking purposes.

#### 4. **Legal Significance**
- A **repealed regulation** means the provision is **no longer legally enforceable**.
- Any legal action, compliance requirement, or administrative enforcement based on those sections is **invalid or obsolete**.
- Repeal typically occurs to:
  - Modernize outdated rules.
  - Remove conflicting or redundant provisions.
  - Align with new legislation or policy.

#### 5. **Key Takeaways**
| Point | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ The regulation is **no longer in effect** | All cited sections have been formally removed. |
| 📚 The repeal was enacted via **SOR/2015-185** and **SOR/2017-1** | These instruments legally removed the provisions. |
| 🔁 The list contains **redundant entries** | Likely a technical or data-processing artifact; not indicative of actual legal content. |
