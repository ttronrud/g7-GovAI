### **Legal Basis**

### **Significance and Implications**  
- This regulation reflects a policy of enabling federal employees to access land for personal or recreational use, particularly in remote northern regions.  
- It demonstrates a balance between allowing employee access to natural resources for personal enjoyment and preserving the integrity of the land for environmental, mineral, and public use purposes.  
- The exclusion of mineral rights ensures that the Government of Canada and the Northwest Territories retain control over natural resource development, preventing potential conflicts or unauthorized exploitation.  
- The un-surveyed nature of the land may require future formal surveying and legal demarcation to establish clear boundaries and enforce the lease terms.

### **Conclusion**  
This Order is a targeted, limited authorization allowing Wayne Angus Keefe, a federal employee of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, to lease a small, un-surveyed parcel of land in the Northwest Territories for recreational use. The lease is strictly defined, excludes all mineral rights, and is subject to the legal framework of the *Territorial Lands Act*. It underscores the government’s ability to grant land interests to federal employees while safeguarding public and environmental interests through clear legal boundaries and exclusions.

This regulation serves as a practical example of how federal land use policies can support employee well-being in remote areas while maintaining regulatory oversight and resource protection.
