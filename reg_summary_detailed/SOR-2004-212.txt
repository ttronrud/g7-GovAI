### **Detailed Summary of the Pickering Airport Site Zoning Regulations**

The **Pickering Airport Site Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act (R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1)** to ensure the safe operation of the Pickering Airport and protect aviation safety by restricting land use and development in its vicinity. These regulations were formally adopted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, pursuant to **paragraphs 5.4(2)(b)a and (c)a of the Aeronautics Act**, following a public consultation period.

## **1. Background and Purpose**

### **Public Notice and Opportunity for Comment**
- The proposed regulations were published in two successive issues of the **Canada Gazette, Part I**, on **April 12 and April 19, 2003**.
- They were also published in the **Toronto Star** (April 14 and 15, 2003) and **L’Express** (April 15 and April 22, 2003).
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (including residents, developers, environmental groups, and aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations to the Minister of Transport.

### **Primary Objectives**
1. **Prevent incompatible land use or development** near the airport that could compromise the **safe operation of aircraft**.
2. **Prevent interference with critical aeronautical signals and communications** (e.g., radar, radio, navigation systems) that are essential for aircraft safety during takeoff, landing, and flight operations.

These objectives are central to maintaining aviation safety and operational integrity around the airport.

## **2. Definitions and Key Terms**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Pickering Airport site, spanning parts of the **Town of Markham**, **City of Pickering**, and **Township of Uxbridge**, all within the **Regional Municipality of York and Durham**. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used to establish elevations and geometric boundaries. Located at **648,000 E and 4,867,000 N** (UTM Zone 17, 1927 NAD 1974 adjustment), 36.23 m west from threshold 26L on runway 08R-26L. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined surfaces extending from each end of the strip surfaces (runways), designed to prevent obstacles from interfering with aircraft during approach and takeoff. Gradient changes from **1:60** (first 3,000 m) to **1:50** (beyond 3,000 m). |
| **Bird Hazard Zone** | A designated area near the airport where activities attracting birds (e.g., open fields, feeding, waste) are prohibited due to the risk of bird strikes, which endanger aircraft. |
| **Outer Limit** | The boundary encompassing all of the following: approach surfaces, outer surface, transitional surfaces, strip surface, and bird hazard zone. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a **constant elevation of 45 m above the ARP**, but **not less than 9 m above ground level** where terrain is lower. |
| **Strip Surface** | The actual runway or landing area (e.g., proposed runways 09–27, 14–32, 08C–26C, etc.) where aircraft take off and land. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined surfaces extending from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces, designed to prevent obstructions from interfering with aircraft during flight paths. |

> **Elevation Reference**:  
> The ARP is assigned an elevation of **255.000 m above sea level (CGVD28, 1978 Adjustment)**. All other surfaces are measured relative to this point.

## **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all land** — including public road allowances — that is:
- Adjacent to or in the **vicinity of the Pickering Airport**,
- Specifically described in **Part 6 of the Schedule**.

This includes land in the following geographic townships:
- **Pickering** (now part of the City of Pickering),
- **Uxbridge** (now part of the Township of Uxbridge),
- **Markham** (now part of the Towns of Markham and Whitchurch-Stouffville).

---

## **4. Key Prohibitions and Restrictions**

### **(a) Building and Structure Height Limits**
No person may:
- Erect or construct a building, structure, or object,
- Or add to an existing one,
**whose highest point exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:
- Approach surfaces
- Outer surface
- Transitional surfaces
- Strip surface

> This ensures that no structure (e.g., towers, trees, buildings) will obstruct aircraft during takeoff or landing.

---

### **(b) Interference with Aeronautical Signals**
No owner or lessee of land **within the outer surface** may:
- Use or develop the land in a way that causes **interference with signals or communications** to or from:
  - Aircraft
  - Aeronautical facilities (e.g., radar, radio towers, navigation beacons)

> This protects the integrity of air traffic control and communication systems.

---

### **(c) Natural Growth Restrictions**
No owner or lessee may allow **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) to grow to a height that exceeds:
- The elevation of any of the surfaces referenced in Section 3 (i.e., approach, outer, transitional, or strip surfaces)

> This prevents trees or vegetation from becoming hazards during flight operations.

---

### **(d) Bird Hazard Zone Prohibitions**
No owner or lessee of land **within the bird hazard zone** may:
- Permit activities or uses that **attract birds** (e.g., open fields, feeding, water sources, waste disposal), which could create a **hazard to aviation safety**.

> The goal is to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which can cause catastrophic damage to aircraft.

---

## **5. Regulatory Timeline and Enforcement**

- **Effective Date**: The regulations come into force on the day when the requirements under **subsection 5.6(2) of the Aeronautics Act** are met.  
  (This typically involves formal approval processes and may be subject to a transition period or further review.)

- **Enforcement**: The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport** through the **Department of Transport**, with powers to issue penalties or orders for non-compliance.

## **6. Geographic and Technical Details**

### **Airport Reference Point (ARP) Coordinates**
- **Grid Coordinates**: 647,904.53 E and 4,867,734.54 N (UTM Zone 17, 1927 NAD 1974)
- Located at the **easterly end of proposed runway 08R-26L**, 36.23 m west of threshold 26L, then 739.96 m southward.

### **Approach Surfaces (by Runway)**
Each approach surface has a two-stage slope:
1. **First 3,000 m**: 1:60 gradient (1 m vertical per 60 m horizontal)
2. **Beyond 3,000 m**: 1:50 gradient (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal)

Elevations at the outer edge vary by runway:
- Runway 09: 274 m above strip surface
- Runway 27: 290 m
- Runway 14: 290 m
- Runway 32: 290 m
- Runway 08C/08L/08R: 286 m
- Runway 26R/26C: 290 m
- Runway 26L: 290 m

> Outer edge lengths range from **2,431 m to 2,781 m** on either side of the runway centerline.

### **Outer Surface**
- Constant elevation of **45 m above ARP** (255.000 m → 300.000 m)
- **Minimum of 9 m above ground** where terrain is lower (to prevent undercutting)

> This creates a buffer zone around the airport where all structures must remain below this elevation.

### **Transitional Surfaces**
- Extend from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces.
- Slope gradually upward to meet the outer surface.
- Designed to prevent obstructions from affecting aircraft during flight paths.
