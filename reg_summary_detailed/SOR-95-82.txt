### **Overview**

This regulation, made under **section 101 of the Customs Tariff** and based on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, provides for the **remission (exemption)** of certain import duties on specific goods brought into Canada by **scientific or exploratory expeditions**. The purpose is to support scientific research and exploration activities by reducing financial barriers to importing essential equipment and supplies.

> **Note**: This regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/98-60, section 2**, and is no longer in force. However, the summary below reflects its original content and intent as it existed prior to repeal.

### **Scope of Duty Remission**

Two distinct categories of goods are eligible for duty remission:

#### 1. **Foodstuffs and Other Consumable Goods (excluding alcohol and tobacco)**  
- **Remission granted** for food and consumable goods imported **on or after January 1, 1991**.
- These goods must be imported **exclusively for use** by the scientific or exploratory expedition during field studies in Canada.
- Applies to **all taxes** imposed under Division III of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* and other applicable parts of the Act (excluding alcoholic beverages and tobacco products).

#### 2. **Scientific Equipment, Spare Parts, and Tools**  
- **Remission granted** for:
  - Scientific equipment,
  - Spare parts of scientific equipment,
  - Tools (as defined)  
- Imported **on or after January 1, 1991**.
- For use **exclusively in conducting field studies** in Canada.

> *Note*: The exemption applies only to goods used in the **field** and not for general commercial or domestic use.

---

### **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for duty remission, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Documentation Requirement**  
   - The scientific equipment, spare parts, and tools must be **clearly described** in a document submitted **at the time of importation**.  
   - The form of the document must be **authorized by the Minister of National Revenue**.

2. **Exclusive Use**  
   - The goods must be used **exclusively** by the scientific or exploratory expedition in conducting field studies in Canada.  
   - No commercial, personal, or non-research use is permitted.

3. **Disposition of Goods After Use**  
   - The goods must be either:
     - **Destroyed in Canada** under the supervision of a customs officer, **at the importer’s expense**, or  
     - **Exported from Canada** within **two years** after the date the goods were accounted for under the *Customs Act*.

> *Note*: If an extension is granted, the two-year period is extended **only up to two years** from the expiration of the extension.

---

### **Extension of the Two-Year Period**

- The Minister may **grant one or more extensions** (not exceeding **two years each**) to the two-year deadline for destruction or export.
- Extensions are **only available** if the importer provides **evidence** that the extension is necessary to allow the expedition to **complete its field studies** in Canada.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- The regulation is issued under **section 101 of the Customs Tariff**, which authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue) to make orders relating to duties on imports.
- It is specifically tied to **scientific and exploratory research**, reflecting a policy of supporting international scientific collaboration and knowledge generation.

---

### **Policy Objectives**

- To **facilitate scientific research** by reducing the cost of importing essential equipment and supplies.
- To **encourage international cooperation** in science and exploration by allowing non-resident researchers to bring necessary tools into Canada.
- To ensure **transparency and accountability** through mandatory documentation and reporting of data obtained during field studies.
- To **protect public interest** by requiring that all data gathered in Canada be shared with the Government of Canada.

---

### **Key Repeal Notes**

- The regulation was **fully repealed** by **SOR/98-60, sections 2 and 3**:
  - **Section 2**: Repeals the entire regulation (remission of duties).
  - **Section 3**: Repeals the definition of "support equipment" and "tools".
- As of the date of repeal, **no duty remission** is available under this specific order for scientific or exploratory expeditions.

> **Important**: This regulation is **no longer active** and should not be used as a basis for current duty exemptions. Current policies may be governed by other legislation or updated frameworks.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation was a targeted policy measure designed to support scientific exploration and research by exempting certain imported goods from excise duties. It emphasized **scientific purpose**, **exclusivity of use**, and **data sharing obligations**. However, due to its repeal in 1998, it is **no longer applicable** in Canadian customs and excise law. Any current duty exemptions for scientific expeditions would need to be assessed under **current legislation**, such as the *Customs Act*, *Excise Tax Act*, or other modern policy instruments.
