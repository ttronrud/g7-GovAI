#### 📌 For Old Age Security Act (OASA) – Canada:

  - Counts as **residence in Canada** only for the purpose of this Agreement.

> *Note: Paragraph 1(c) applies only after January 1, 1994.*

#### 📌 For Canada Pension Plan (CPP):
- A calendar year with **at least 13 weeks of contributions** under Antiguan legislation is treated as **one year of CPP contributions**.
- **Year 1973** is treated as **39 weeks** of contributions.
- A calendar year **after April 2, 1973** is treated as **52 weeks** of contributions.

#### 📌 For Antiguan Legislation:

#### Case 2: Partial Pension or Spouse’s Allowance
- If a person is entitled to a **partial pension or spouse’s allowance** under the OASA:
  - The **earnings-related portion** is calculated based on **CPP pensionable earnings**.

    > (Flat-rate portion under CPP) × (Ratio of actual CPP contributions to minimum qualifying period)
