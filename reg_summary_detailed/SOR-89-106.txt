### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Regulation**
- The entry refers to a **section (s. 409)** of a regulatory document, likely part of a statute or administrative regulation under the authority of a federal government department (e.g., Health, Environment, or Labour).
- The regulation itself is **no longer in force** due to being formally repealed.

#### 2. **Repeal Details**
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: May 15, 2007
- **Legal Instrument**: *Supplement to the Canada Gazette*, No. 2007-128 (SOR/2007-128)
- **Section Affected**: Section 409
- **Reason for Repeal**: The section was deemed obsolete, redundant, inconsistent with updated policy, or superseded by newer legislation or regulations. The exact reason is not provided in the text, but such repeals are typically part of regulatory modernization efforts.

#### 3. **Legal and Practical Implications**
- **No Current Legal Force**: Section 409 is **not applicable or enforceable** today.
- **Historical Reference**: It may still be referenced in legal research, court decisions, or policy analyses to understand prior regulatory frameworks.
- **Impact on Compliance**: Any obligations or requirements previously governed by section 409 are now governed by other, current regulations or laws.

#### 4. **Contextual Considerations**
- Without the original text of the regulation, it is not possible to determine:
  - What the original section 409 governed (e.g., licensing, reporting, safety standards, environmental protections, etc.).
  - The specific statute or regulatory framework it was part of (e.g., *Food and Drug Regulations*, *Canadian Environmental Protection Act*, etc.).
- However, the repetition of the same entry suggests that this section was referenced multiple times in a document or database, possibly indicating that it was a key or frequently cited provision before its repeal.

#### 5. **How to Find the Original Section**
To understand what section 409 originally addressed, one would need to:
- Access the full text of **SOR/2007-128** (available via the [Government of Canada’s regulations database](https://www.canada.ca/en/regs.html)).
- Locate the section that was repealed and review the explanatory notes or legislative history.
- Search for references to section 409 in prior regulations or legal decisions.
