**Detailed Summary of the Name Use (Cooperative Credit Association) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Enactment:**  
The Name Use (Cooperative Credit Association) Regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This action is authorized under specific provisions of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*—specifically, **section 463** and **subsection 465(4)**. The regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**, and are formally cited as the *Name Use (Cooperative Credit Association) Regulations*.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to establish clear and lawful conditions under which a cooperative credit association may use its official name in connection with a transaction involving securities. This ensures transparency, legal compliance, and protects the integrity of financial communications related to securities offerings or transactions.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Permitted Use of the Association’s Name:**  
   A person (such as an issuer, broker, or financial advisor) may use the name of a cooperative credit association in a variety of financial documents associated with a securities transaction, including:  
   - Prospectus  
   - Offering memorandum  
   - Takeover bid circular  
   - Advertisement for a transaction related to securities  
   - Any other document connected to a securities transaction  

2. **Conditions for Permitted Use:**  
   The use of the association’s name is permitted only under **two specific conditions**:  
   - **Requirement by law**: If the use of the name is mandated by applicable legislation or regulatory requirements.  
   - **Express written permission**: If the cooperative credit association has explicitly and voluntarily granted written consent for the use of its name in the specified document or transaction.

3. **Scope and Application:**  
   The regulation applies to all transactions involving securities—whether involving the issuance of shares, bonds, or participation in mergers, takeovers, or other financial arrangements—where the name of a cooperative credit association is used in promotional, informational, or legal documents.

4. **Legal and Ethical Safeguards:**  
   By requiring either legal necessity or prior written consent, the regulation prevents unauthorized or misleading use of the association’s name. This helps maintain public trust, avoids confusion, and ensures that the association retains control over how its brand is represented in financial markets.

**Significance and Implications:**  
- This regulation provides a clear, legally grounded framework for the use of cooperative credit associations’ names in public financial disclosures.  
- It balances the need for transparency in securities transactions with the protection of the association’s identity and reputation.  
- It supports compliance with securities laws by ensuring that any use of the association’s name is both lawful and authorized.  
- It reinforces the principle that such use is not automatic or default—only permissible when required by law or when explicitly approved by the association.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Name Use (Cooperative Credit Association) Regulations* serve as a critical component of the regulatory framework governing cooperative credit associations in Canada. By limiting the use of the association’s name to legally required or explicitly authorized situations, the regulations promote accountability, prevent misuse, and uphold the integrity of financial communications in the securities market. These rules remain effective as of the date of issuance and are binding on all parties involved in securities-related transactions where the name of a cooperative credit association is used.
