## 🔍 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Bond** | A contract of insurance under which one party agrees to indemnify another for losses arising from the act of a third party (e.g., fraud, theft, dishonesty). *Note: This is distinct from a financial bond or debt instrument.* |

## 🚫 Exemptions (When Regulations Do Not Apply)

The Regulations **do not apply** in the following situations:

1. **Jurisdictional Compliance**:  
   If a society is operating in a jurisdiction and is complying with **local laws** that are **inconsistent** with these Regulations.

2. **Estate or Trust Administration**:  
   To the extent that the Regulations conflict with:
   - A legal duty or power imposed on the society in relation to the **administration of an estate or trust**; or  
   - The society’s responsibilities as an **agent** (e.g., acting on behalf of a client or beneficiary).

> This ensures flexibility for societies performing legal or fiduciary duties that may require different asset-handling procedures.

---

## ✅ Core Obligations for Societies

### 1. **Asset Handling Procedures**
- A society must:
  - Maintain a **written record** outlining the **procedures for handling and safeguarding** its assets.
  - **Inform all relevant personnel** (directors, officers, employees, agents) who have access to or are involved in asset management about these procedures.

> Purpose: Ensures transparency, accountability, and clear lines of responsibility in asset protection.

---

### 2. **Security Recordkeeping**
- The society must maintain an **up-to-date record** identifying **each security** it owns or holds.

> This includes details such as issuer, type, quantity, value, and current status.

> Purpose: Enables auditability and traceability of financial holdings.

---

### 3. **Secure Custody of Securities**
- **General Rule**:  
  Every security must be kept securely, in a manner that prevents unauthorized access, and in one of the following forms:
  - In the **custody of the society**; or  
  - In the custody of an **authorized entity** that:
    - Is licensed to act as a **custodian of securities**, or  
    - Is a **depository or clearing agency** authorized by law in the jurisdiction where it operates.

> ⚠️ **Exceptions to Custody Requirement**:
  - Securities under the **control of the government** of the jurisdiction where the society operates.
  - Securities **pledged as collateral** for debt or potential debt.
  - Securities **loaned** to a person under a written agreement.
  - Securities **in transit** (e.g., being transported).

> Purpose: Balances security with practicality — avoids unnecessary restrictions in common scenarios.

---

### 4. **Custodial Agreement Requirement**
- A society **must not** place a security with an authorized custodian unless it has entered into a **written custodial agreement** with that entity.

> This ensures legal accountability, clarity of responsibilities, and protection against misuse.

---

### 5. **Daily Deposit of Net Proceeds**
- On a **daily basis**, any net amount received from a **security transaction** (e.g., sale, redemption) must be deposited into one of the following accounts:

| Option | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| With the society itself | (Self-held account) |
| With a **financial institution** authorized to accept deposits in the jurisdiction |
| With a **trust company** authorized to hold money in trust |
| With the **government** of the jurisdiction or its authorized agency (e.g., securities custodian) |
| With **CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.** (a major Canadian securities depository) |

> Purpose: Prevents misuse or misappropriation of funds by ensuring liquidity is immediately secured and accessible only through authorized channels.

---

### 6. **Registration of Securities**
- **General Rule**:  
  Every security must be **registered in the society’s name** in the register of the issuing entity.

> Exceptions (where registration is not required):
  - The security **cannot be registered** due to reasons **beyond the society’s control** (e.g., technical or legal barriers).
  - Under the **control of the government**.
  - Held as **collateral or for safekeeping**.
  - Registered in the name of a **nominee** (e.g., a trust or agent).
  - Held under a **book-entry, certificateless system** (e.g., electronic book-entry via a central depository).

    - Reorganization  
    - Amalgamation  
    - Liquidation  
    - Voting  

> Purpose: Ensures ownership clarity and legal enforceability, while recognizing operational realities.

---

### 7. **Bearer Form or Alternative Registration (Where Applicable)**
- If a security is **already protected against loss, fraud, theft, or destruction**, the society may:
  - Hold it in **bearer form** (i.e., payable to whoever possesses it), or  
  - Hold it in **registered form in a name other than the society’s own** (e.g., in the name of a nominee).

> This exception applies only when **risk of loss is mitigated** (e.g., through physical security, insurance, or electronic safeguards).

> Purpose: Allows flexibility in holding certain securities without requiring full registration, provided risks are adequately managed.
