### Key Provisions and Background:

1. **Objective of the Proclamation:**  
   The primary purpose of this proclamation is to **officially notify the public and relevant stakeholders** that the **Canada-Cameroon Income Tax Convention** has entered into force in Canada.

2. **The Convention in Question:**  
   The full title of the agreement is:  
   *"The Convention between Canada and the United Republic of Cameroon for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income."*  
   - This is a bilateral tax treaty designed to prevent **double taxation** of income earned by individuals and entities in either country and to combat **fiscal evasion** (tax avoidance or fraud).

3. **Entry into Force of the Convention:**  
   - According to **Article 26** of the Convention, the treaty enters into force upon the **exchange of instruments of ratification** between Canada and Cameroon.  
   - The exchange of ratification instruments occurred on **June 16, 1988**.  
   - This date marks the official start of the treaty’s legal operation in both countries.

4. **Legal Mechanism for Notification in Canada:**  
   - Section 10 of the Canada-Cameroon Income Tax Convention Act, 1984, mandates that the **Governor in Council must issue a proclamation** in the *Canada Gazette* to announce the entry into force of the Convention.  
   - This proclamation serves as the formal legal notice to all persons, entities, and government bodies within Canada that the treaty is now in effect and binding.

5. **Content of the Proclamation:**  
   The proclamation explicitly states:  
   > “We, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada, do by this Our Proclamation give notice that the Convention between Canada and the United Republic of Cameroon for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income came into force on June 16, 1988.”

6. **Legal Effect:**  
   - Once proclaimed, the Convention becomes **legally binding** in Canada.  
   - It establishes specific rules for the taxation of income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains, employment income) earned by Canadian residents in Cameroon and by Cameroonian residents in Canada.  
   - It provides mechanisms for resolving disputes over tax liability and prevents individuals or businesses from being taxed twice on the same income in both countries.

7. **Public Obligation:**  
   - All individuals, corporations, tax authorities, and other parties affected by the Convention are **required to take notice** of its entry into force and to **govern themselves accordingly**.  
   - This includes tax professionals, financial institutions, and tax officials who must apply the treaty’s provisions in assessing and administering tax obligations.

8. **Seal and Authentication:**  
   - The proclamation is authenticated by the **Great Seal of Canada**, affirming its official status.  
   - Signed by **Jeanne Sauvé**, who served as **Governor General of Canada** at the time and was a prominent member of the Privy Council, Chancellor of the Order of Canada, and Commander of the Order of Military Merit.

### Significance and Implications:

- **International Cooperation:**
