### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Human Rights Benefit Regulations (as enacted by S.C. 1976-77, c. 33, effective March 1, 1980)**

---

#### **Overview**

The **Canadian Human Rights Benefit Regulations** (commonly referred to as the *Canadian Human Rights Benefit Regulations*) were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, under **Section 18 of the Canadian Human Rights Act**. These regulations provide a detailed framework for defining key terms related to benefit plans and establish **exceptions to discriminatory practices** in employer-provided pension and insurance plans.

The regulations are designed to **protect employees from discriminatory treatment** in the administration of benefit plans—such as pensions, disability income insurance, health insurance, and life insurance—while recognizing that certain types of differences in plan provisions may be **legitimate, non-discriminatory, and based on actuarial or practical considerations**.

Importantly, these regulations **do not create new rights or obligations**; rather, they clarify what constitutes a discriminatory practice under Part III of the *Canadian Human Rights Act*, which prohibits discrimination in employment on grounds such as **race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, marital status, family status, or disability**.

## **Key Definitions in the Regulations**

The regulations begin by defining core terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canadian Human Rights Act* (Loi). |
| **Actuarial basis** | The methodology used by a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries to estimate benefit costs based on life contingencies (e.g., death, disability, illness). This is considered a valid justification for differences in benefits. |
| **Benefit** | Includes lump sums, periodic payments (e.g., monthly), or accrued benefits under a plan for: <br> - Retirement, termination, disability, accident, sickness, or death; <br> - Medical, hospital, nursing, drug, or dental expenses; <br> - Death benefits to beneficiaries. |
| **Benefit plan** | Any insurance or pension plan—whether written or oral—offered to employees. |
| **Child** | A biological or adopted child of the employee or their spouse/common-law partner. |
| **Common-law partner** | A person with whom the employee has cohabited in a conjugal relationship for at least one year prior to a qualifying event (e.g., death or retirement). |
| **Dependent** | As defined in the plan itself. |
| **Disability income insurance plan** | Provides income replacement for employees due to sickness, accident, or disability. |
| **Health insurance plan** | Covers medical, hospital, nursing, drug, or dental expenses for the employee or their family (spouse, child, dependant). |
| **Insurance plan** | A broad category including disability, health, or life insurance plans. |
| **Life insurance plan** | Pays a lump sum or periodic benefits upon the death of the employee or a family member. |
| **Normal age of retirement** | The maximum age applicable to a position, as specified in Section 14(b) or (c) of the Act. |
| **Normal pensionable age** | The earliest date (age or period of service) at which an employee can retire and receive full benefits without early retirement penalties. |
| **Pension plan** | Includes defined benefit, money purchase, profit-sharing, or composite plans. Benefits are based on contributions and investment returns. |
| **Voluntary employee contribution** | A contribution made by an employee to a plan, excluding cases where such contributions trigger employer obligations. |

> Note: Several definitions have been **repealed** (e.g., “spouse” and “health insurance plan” as standalone terms) and replaced or removed via amendments such as **SOR/2022-150**, reflecting updates to modernize and align with current legal and social standards.

## **Core Purpose: What Does NOT Constitute Discrimination?**

This is the central and most significant part of the regulation. It establishes a **list of permissible differences** in benefit plans that **do not constitute discriminatory practices** under the Canadian Human Rights Act.

These exceptions are grounded in **actuarial fairness**, **practical operational needs**, and **familial or statutory protections**.

---

### **1. Provisions in Pension Plans That Are Permissible (Non-Discriminatory)**

The following pension plan provisions **do not constitute discrimination**:

#### ✅ **Age-Based Exclusions (before 25 years of age)**
- Employees who do not make contributions may not be required to join the plan until they are 25 years old.
- Employees who do make contributions may still be required to wait until age 25 to join.

> *Rationale*: This is seen as a reasonable threshold to ensure financial sustainability and long-term plan viability.

#### ✅ **Exclusion Based on Health Requirements (Pre-Participation)**
- Exclusion from participation if the employee fails to meet health requirements to accrue benefits.
- Exclusion of service before joining the plan due to pre-existing health conditions.

> *Rationale*: Health-based eligibility is a common and legitimate requirement in pension plans.

#### ✅ **Exclusion in Disability Plans Based on Age**
- An employee is excluded from a disability income plan if they reach the age at which benefits would not be payable (i.e., age ≥ 65 or normal pensionable age, whichever comes first).

> *Rationale*: After retirement age, disability income is generally not needed.

#### ✅ **Exclusion in Health Plans Due to Health Requirements**
- Employees not meeting health criteria are excluded from health insurance plans.
- Employers pay the excluded employee the same amount they would pay to an eligible employee (i.e., employer contribution is equalized).

> *Rationale*: Ensures equity in employer cost, even if the employee is excluded due to health.

#### ✅ **Voluntary Employee Contribution Exclusions**
- Employees excluded from voluntary contribution features (e.g., voluntary life or disability insurance) due to health requirements.

> *Rationale*: Health-based eligibility is acceptable in voluntary plans.

#### ✅ **Choice-Based Exclusion**
- An employee excluded from joining a plan because they chose not to participate initially and later failed to meet health requirements.
- Participation delayed until the employee is actively working again after meeting all requirements.

> *Rationale*: Reflects individual choice and employment status.

#### ✅ **No Differentiation on Grounds of Discrimination (except as allowed)**
- Plan provisions that do not differentiate between employees on grounds of race, sex, religion, etc., **unless** such differentiation is explicitly allowed under the above exceptions.

### **2. Provisions in Pension Plans That Are Permissible (Non-Discriminatory)**

#### ✅ **Age-Based Benefit Differences (Actuarial Basis)**
- Differences in monthly benefits based on age, **if determined on an actuarial basis**.
- Adjustments for benefits under CPP, OAS, or provincial pensions are allowed under the *Pension Benefits Standards Act*.

> *Rationale*: Actuarial calculations are standard in pension design and reflect risk and longevity.

#### ✅ **Marital Status Differences (Legitimate)**
- Benefits payable to a surviving spouse or common-law partner after death.
- Increase in benefits for former employees with a dependent spouse or common-law partner.

> *Rationale*: Recognizes family responsibilities and survivorship needs.

#### ✅ **Family Status Differences (Legitimate)**
- Benefits paid to surviving children of deceased employees.

> *Rationale*: Supports family continuity and financial stability.

#### ✅ **Lump Sum Benefits Based on Marital/Family Status**
- Lump sum benefits to surviving spouse or child upon death of employee.
- Lump sum benefits to employee upon death of spouse or common-law partner.

> *Rationale*: Provides financial security to dependents and family units.

#### ✅ **Voluntary Employee Contribution Differences (Sex-Based)**
- In voluntary employee-pay-all pension plans, differences in benefits due to sex **only if** based on actuarial basis.

> *Rationale*: Actuarial justification overrides sex-based discrimination.

#### ✅ **Conversion Option Restrictions**
- Employees unable to convert benefits due to health requirements (e.g., inability to exercise conversion option).

> *Rationale*: Health-based restrictions are acceptable.

#### ✅ **No Discrimination on Other Grounds**
- No differentiation in benefits on any prohibited ground (e.g., race, religion, disability) **unless** one of the above exceptions applies.

### **3. Provisions in Insurance Plans That Are Permissible**

#### ✅ **Age-Based Differences in Life Insurance (Actuarial Basis)**
- In voluntary life insurance plans, differences in benefits based on age **only if** determined on actuarial basis.

> *Rationale*: Actuarial risk assessment is standard.

#### ✅ **Disability Benefits Cease at Age 65 or Normal Pensionable Age**
- Benefits under a disability income plan cease when the employee reaches age 65 or the normal pensionable age (whichever is earlier).

> *Rationale*: Retirement age is a natural endpoint for disability income.

#### ✅ **One-Year Waiting Period for Pre-Existing Conditions**
- During the first year of coverage, benefits are not paid for conditions that began before that date and were treated within the prior year.

> *Rationale*: Prevents abuse of coverage for pre-existing conditions.

#### ✅ **Health Insurance Rate Differences (Based on Health Requirements)**
- Benefits are capped for members who meet health requirements; higher benefits only available to those meeting health standards.
- Employer contributions are based on actuarial basis:
  - Up to a maximum benefit (for all
