- The regulation is made under **subsection 109.1(3)a of the Customs Act**.
- It is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue**.
- This means the regulation is a formal administrative instrument authorized by federal law to implement specific provisions of the *Customs Act*.
- The regulation is referenced in **S.C. 2001, c. 25, s. 62** and in **R.S., c. 1 (2nd Supp.)**, indicating its official publication and statutory reference.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary purpose of these *Designated Provisions (Customs) Regulations* is to:
- **Identify specific provisions** of the *Customs Act*, *Customs Tariff*, or related regulations that are **designated for use in assessing contraventions** under subsection **109.1(1)** of the *Customs Act*.
- Provide **clear, standardized short-form descriptions** of these designated provisions to be used in **notices of assessment** issued by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).
- Ensure **consistency, clarity, and transparency** in how violations are described in official assessments, particularly when determining penalties or enforcement actions.

---

#### **3. Key Provisions of the Regulation**

##### **A. Designation of Provisions**
- Any provision listed in **Column 1 of Schedules 1 or 2** of the *Customs Act* or *Customs Tariff*, or a regulation made under those Acts, is **designated** for the purposes of **subsection 109.1(1)** of the *Customs Act*.
- This designation means that such provisions are **subject to assessment and enforcement** when a violation occurs.

##### **B. Short-Form Descriptions**
- The **short-form description** of a designated provision is taken from **Column 2** of the corresponding item in Schedules 1 or 2.
- These short-form descriptions are **used in official notices of assessment** to clearly identify the specific rule that has been violated.
- Example: Instead of quoting the full legal text, a notice may state: *"Failure to present oneself to an officer without delay"* — this is the short-form description derived from the designated provision.

##### **C. Application in Notices of Assessment**
- **Subject to subsection 109.3(4)** of the *Customs Act*, the **applicable short-form description** must be used in a **notice of assessment** (i.e., the formal document issued by CBSA when a violation is found).
- This ensures:
  - Legal precision in enforcement.
  - Clarity for the taxpayer or business involved.
  - Consistency in how violations are communicated and assessed.

##### **D. Effective Date**
- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- This is standard administrative practice, ensuring immediate applicability upon formal adoption.
