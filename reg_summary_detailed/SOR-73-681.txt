### **Overview**

The *Foreign Claims (Czechoslovakia) Settlement Regulations* are a set of administrative rules enacted by the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs and the Minister of Finance, under **Vote Item 22a in Schedule B of Appropriation Act No. 9, 1966**. These regulations establish the framework for determining and paying out claims from the **Foreign Claims Fund** related to property, rights, and interests lost or affected in Czechoslovakia prior to **April 18, 1973**, due to nationalization, expropriation, or similar government actions.

### **Eligibility and Timing of Claims**

1. **Deadline for Notice of Claim**  
   - Only claims where a **notice of claim** was submitted to the Government of Canada **on or before June 22, 1973** will be considered by the Commission.  
   - All such notices must be referred to the Commission for review.

2. **Submission of Evidence**  
   - All documentary evidence intended to support a claim must be submitted to the Commission **by March 31, 1974**.

3. **Citizenship Requirement for Award Eligibility**  
   - To be eligible for an award, a claimant must have been a **Canadian citizen** from the time the claim arose (or when title was obtained) **until June 22, 1973**.  
   - If title to a claim was acquired **after** the claim arose, **each predecessor in title** must have been a Canadian citizen during the period they held the title.

4. **Succession and Death After June 22, 1973**  
   - If a claimant dies **after June 22, 1973**, an award may be made to any person lawfully entitled to it, regardless of nationality.

5. **Corporate Claimants**  
   - A "corporation" is defined as a Canadian-incorporated entity that would have been eligible for an award if it were classified as a Canadian citizen.  
   - If a Canadian citizen is a shareholder in such a corporation, the claimant may receive an award in proportion to their ownership stake.  
     - *Example*: If a shareholder owns 10% of a corporation’s shares, they receive 10% of the total award that would have been given to the corporation.

6. **Offsetting Compensation from Other Sources**  
   - If a claimant receives or is likely to receive compensation from **any source other than the Fund**, the Commission must **deduct that amount** from the recommended award.  
   - If a claimant **neglects or defaults** in receiving compensation from another source, they are **deemed to have received it** for purposes of this regulation.  
   - If a claimant **knows or should know** that failure to act by a deadline would result in losing compensation from another source, this is considered **neglect** and triggers the deemed payment rule.
