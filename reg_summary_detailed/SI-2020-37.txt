### **Regulation Summary: Remission of Part I Licence Fees for Fiscal Year 2020–2021**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**.
- It is promulgated by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Treasury Board**.
- The regulation is grounded in the **Broadcasting Licence Fee Regulations, 1997 (SOR/97-144)**, specifically **paragraph 3(a)**, which outlines the fees payable by licensees under the broadcasting framework.

#### **2. Nature of the Action**
- The Governor General in Council has **remitted (i.e., waived or forgave)** the **Part I licence fees** that were due or paid by all licensees under **paragraph 3(a)** of the Broadcasting Licence Fee Regulations, 1997.
- This remission applies specifically to the **fiscal year 2020–2021**.

#### **3. Scope of the Remission**
- **All licensees** who were subject to Part I licence fees under paragraph 3(a) of the Broadcasting Licence Fee Regulations are affected.
- "Part I licence fees" typically refer to the **basic licence fees** paid by broadcasters (such as radio and television stations) to the federal government for the right to operate under a broadcasting licence.
- The remission covers the **entire fee obligation** for the 2020–2021 fiscal year, meaning no payment is required from these licensees for that period.

#### **4. Rationale and Public Interest**
- The remission is justified on the grounds that it is **in the public interest**.
- This decision likely reflects a response to **external circumstances** affecting the broadcasting sector during that period, such as:
  - The **economic impact of the global pandemic (COVID-19)** in 2020–2021.
  - Financial hardship faced by broadcasters.
  - A need to support media access and public service broadcasting during a time of social and economic disruption.
- The decision was made after consultation with the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** (responsible for broadcasting policy) and the **Treasury Board** (responsible for federal financial policy and fiscal management).

#### **5. Legal and Regulatory Context**
- The **Financial Administration Act** provides the legal framework for the government to remit or adjust fees in cases of public interest.
- The **Broadcasting Licence Fee Regulations, 1997** establish the structure and payment obligations for licence fees. Paragraph 3(a) defines the categories of licensees and the fees applicable to them.
- This remission does **not alter the underlying regulations** but instead constitutes a **temporary, discretionary waiver** of a fee obligation for a specific fiscal year.

#### **6. Implications**
- **Financial Relief**: Broadcasters are relieved of the financial burden of paying Part I licence fees for 2020–2021.
- **No Future Obligations**: The remission is **limited to the fiscal year 2020–2021**. Licensees remain responsible for fees in subsequent years unless further remission is granted.
- **Public Service Consideration**: The move supports the continuity of public broadcasting and ensures that broadcasters can maintain services during challenging economic times.

#### **7. Citation and Reference**
- **Statutory Citation**: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2) – Financial Administration Act
- **Regulatory Citation**: R.S., c. F-11 – The Broadcasting Licence Fee Regulations, 1997 (SOR/97-144)
