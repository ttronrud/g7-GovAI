- **Authorized Entity**:  
  The entity authorized to act is **Nordion International Inc.**, a Canadian business corporation.

- **Acquisition Deadline**:  
  The acquisition must be completed **on or before March 31, 1991**. This sets a firm timeline for the transaction, ensuring it occurs within a defined period.

  The shares acquired must be those of **CyberFluor Inc.** that, upon acquisition, will be:
  - Held by Nordion International Inc., or
  - Held on behalf of Nordion International Inc., or

**5. Context and Implications**

- **Privatization or Strategic Investment Context**:  
  Given that the Minister of State for Privatization and Regulatory Affairs is involved, this transaction may be part of a broader government strategy involving the transfer of ownership or restructuring of certain Canadian corporations—potentially to promote efficiency, privatize state-held interests, or support strategic industry development.

- **Nordion’s Background**:  
  Nordion International Inc. is a well-known Canadian company historically involved in the production of medical isotopes and radiation-related technologies. The acquisition of CyberFluor Inc. (a company involved in fluorine-based chemicals or related technologies) may reflect a strategic move to expand into or consolidate capabilities in a complementary or synergistic field.

- **Regulatory Oversight**:  
  The involvement of the Treasury Board and the Minister of State indicates that this transaction underwent appropriate internal review and policy alignment, ensuring it aligns with government financial and regulatory standards.

**6. Limitations and Conditions**

- The Order is **time-bound** (March 31, 1991), and any failure to complete the acquisition by that date would render the authorization ineffective.

- The Order **does not establish ownership rights** in the shares beyond the authorization to acquire and hold them. It does not guarantee the value, terms, or conditions of the transaction (such as price, consideration, or structure), which would be governed by a separate agreement between the parties.

- The Order does **not create any new obligations** for CyberFluor Inc. beyond the acquisition of shares by Nordion.
