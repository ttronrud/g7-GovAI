**Detailed Summary of the Pest Control Products Sales Information Reporting Regulations (S.C. 2002, c. 28)**

---

### **Overview**
These regulations, made under **subsection 67(1) of the Pest Control Products Act (Act)**, establish a comprehensive framework for **annual sales reporting** by registrants of pest control products in Canada. The primary objective is to ensure **transparency, accountability, and traceability** in the movement and distribution of pest control products—critical for protecting human health, environmental safety, and effective regulatory oversight.

The regulations came into force upon registration and apply to all registrants of pest control products, with specific reporting requirements based on the product's intended use and distribution channels.

---

### **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Pest Control Products Act*.
- **"Quantity of a pest control product sold by the registrant"** includes any amount provided to a **distributor for sale on the registrant’s behalf**. This broadens the definition to cover indirect sales through intermediaries.

---

### **Mandatory Annual Sales Reporting (Section 3)**

Every registrant must submit an **annual sales information report** under subsection 8(5) of the Act. The report must include the following information:

1. **Registrant’s details**:
   - Name
   - Postal address
   - Telephone number

2. **Reporting agent details (if applicable)**:
   - If a third party (e.g., a distributor or legal representative) submits the report on behalf of the registrant, their:
     - Name
     - Postal address
     - Telephone number

3. **Report metadata**:
   - Date of submission
   - Calendar year covered by the report

4. **Product-specific details**:
   - Name of the pest control product
   - Registration number of the product

5. **Sales quantity**:
   - Expressed in the **unit of measurement** specified in the product’s **label declaration of net quantity**, as defined in the *Pest Control Products Regulations*.

---

### **Special Reporting Requirements Based on Product Use (Paragraph 3(f))**

#### **Case 1: Products Registered Only for Use in Manufacturing**
These are products used to produce other pest control products or products regulated under:
- The **Feeds Act**
- The **Fertilizers Act**

In this case, the report must include:
- **Total quantity sold directly** by the registrant to manufacturers producing feed or fertilizer-related products.
- **Per province**:
  - Total quantity of the pest control product **contained in** feed or fertilizer products made available for sale by vendors to end users.

> *Purpose*: To track how much of the product enters downstream manufacturing processes and ends up in food or agricultural supply chains.

---

#### **Case 2: All Other Pest Control Products (Not Covered in Case 1)**

For all other products, the report must include detailed provincial breakdowns of sales and distribution:

##### **For each province**, the report must include:
1. **Direct sales to users**:
   - Quantity sold directly to end users, **minus returns** from users.

2. **Direct sales to vendors**:
   - Quantity sold directly to vendors, **minus returns** from vendors.

3. **Direct sales to provincial distributors**:
   - Quantity sold directly to distributors who **only serve users in that province**, **minus returns** from those distributors.

4. **Sales to regional and national distributors**:
   - Quantity sold directly to regional or national distributors, **minus returns** from them.

5. **Quantities made available to users by regional/national distributors**:
   - Total amount made available to users through these distributors (regardless of whether it was sold directly or via distribution).

6. **Sales to manufacturers of treated seeds and feed/fertilizer products**:
   - Total quantity sold directly to:
     - Manufacturers of treated seeds
     - Manufacturers of products regulated under the Feeds Act or Fertilizers Act

7. **Quantity contained in or used to treat products**:
   - For each province:
     - Total quantity of the pest control product **contained in** feed or fertilizer products made available for sale by vendors to users.
     - Total quantity used to **treat seeds** made available for sale by vendors to users.

> *Purpose*: To provide granular visibility into both direct and indirect distribution pathways, including provincial-level data, enabling better monitoring of product exposure and environmental risk.

---

### **Certification of Accuracy**

Every report must be accompanied by a **signed statement** from the person submitting it, certifying that:
- The information is **true and complete** to the best of their knowledge and belief.
- The information is provided in **good faith**.

This ensures accountability and promotes integrity in the reporting process.

---

### **Reporting Timeline and Deadlines**

- Reports are due **on or before June 1** of the year following the calendar year covered by the report.
- The first report must be submitted **no later than June 1 of the year following the first full calendar year after the regulations come into force**.

> *Example*: If the regulations come into force on January 1, 2002, the first annual report would be due by June 1, 2003.

---

### **Emergency Reporting Obligations**

Registrants must provide the **Minister with available sales information** within **15 days** of a request if the request is made for one of the following reasons:
- A situation that **endangers human health or safety** or the **environment**
- To support a decision under the *Pest Control Products Act*

> *Note*: This emergency provision allows regulators to respond quickly to potential risks (e.g., a suspected outbreak of pesticide contamination or misuse).

---

### **Use of Estimates**

If a registrant is unable to obtain exact sales data, they may provide an **estimate** for certain quantities (specifically paragraphs 4(b) and 5(c) and (e)) **provided that**:
1. They clearly **indicate that the figures are estimates**.
2. They **describe the methodology** used to derive the estimate.
3. They **justify the appropriateness** of the methodology (e.g., based on historical data, sales records, or industry benchmarks).

> *Note*: Estimates are permitted only when precise data is unattainable, and they must be transparent and well-justified.

---

### **Recordkeeping and Audit Requirements**

- Registrants must **retain all original records and supporting data** related to the sales information in the report for **six years** after the report is submitted.
- These records must be made available to the Minister upon **request for verification or auditing purposes**.

> *Purpose*: Ensures long-term data integrity and enables independent review and validation of reported sales figures.

---

### **Auditing and Compliance Enforcement**

- If the Minister has **reasonable grounds to believe** that sales information submitted is **inaccurate or incomplete**, the Minister may:
  - Require the registrant to submit a **report prepared by an independent auditor** qualified under provincial law.
  - The registrant must comply with this request **within 60 days** of the Minister’s notice.

> *Note*: This mechanism provides a formal process for verifying data accuracy and reinforces the credibility of the reporting system.

---

### **Exemption Clause**

- **Subsection (1) does not apply** to reports requested under **section 8** of the Act (emergency or decision-making requests).  
  This means the annual reporting requirement (Section 3) does not apply to emergency or ad hoc requests made by the Minister.

---

### **Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).

---

### **Summary of Key Objectives and Impacts**

### **Conclusion**

The *Pest Control Products Sales Information Reporting Regulations* establish a robust, transparent, and enforceable system for tracking the distribution and use of pest control products across Canada. By requiring detailed, province-level reporting and mandating recordkeeping and audit provisions, the regulations enhance public safety, environmental protection, and regulatory effectiveness. The inclusion of emergency reporting and estimation protocols ensures flexibility while maintaining high standards of accuracy and compliance.

These regulations are a cornerstone of Canada’s regulatory framework for pesticide oversight, ensuring that decisions about product safety and use are grounded in reliable, real-world data.
