### **Detailed Summary of the Haisla Nation Liquefied Natural Gas Facility Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 6, s. 3)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legislative Authority**

The **Haisla Nation Liquefied Natural Gas Facility Regulations** were made under the **First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act (FN-CIDA)**, specifically **paragraph 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b)**, which authorize the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to recommend, and the Governor in Council to approve, regulations for a First Nation's commercial and industrial development project.

- The **Haisla Nation** is recognized as a First Nation under the FN-CIDA.
- The Haisla Nation Council formally requested that the Minister recommend these regulations to the Governor in Council.
- The regulations are specifically designed for the **Haisla Nation Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Facility**, located on designated project lands.

#### **2. Purpose and Constitutional Context**

A key motivation behind the regulations is to **resolve constitutional uncertainty** regarding the application of provincial laws to **reserve lands** under the *Constitution Act, 1867*. The federal government seeks to ensure that certain **provincial laws apply as federal law** on the project lands — within the **limits of federal constitutional authority**.

This approach avoids potential conflicts arising from provincial jurisdiction over reserve lands and ensures that the project operates under a clear, legally stable framework.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**

- **Project Lands**:  
  Refers to the specific lands listed in **Schedule 1** of the regulations. These include portions of the **Bees Indian Reserve No. 6**, particularly:
  - All of Lots 1, 3, and 4 on Plan 96252
  - Lots 2-1 and 2-2 on Plan 97774  
  (Total area: approximately **70.63 hectares**)

- **Incorporated Laws**:  
  A comprehensive list of **British Columbia statutes and regulations** (set out in Schedule 2) that are to be applied to the project lands. These laws are "incorporated" into the regulations and are interpreted as having direct effect on the project lands.

---

#### **4. Application of Incorporated Laws**

##### **General Principles**
- The **incorporated laws** apply to the **project lands**, subject to the following:
  - They apply **only if** the corresponding BC law is currently in force.
  - Their application is **limited to federal constitutional authority** — meaning no provincial law may be applied beyond what is constitutionally permissible for federal government action.

##### **Interpretation and Scope**
- The incorporated laws are interpreted in accordance with the **British Columbia Interpretation Act (R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 238)**.
- References to "enactment" in that Act include the incorporated laws.
- Adaptations made in sections 13 to 43 are **part of the incorporated laws** and must be read accordingly.

##### **Exclusions and Limitations**
- The regulations **exclude** certain provisions from being applied:
  - Spent or obsolete provisions
  - Provisions appointing individuals, establishing funds, or authorizing payments from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**
  - Provisions relating to **internal management** of provincial bodies
  - Provisions allowing **regulations of general application** (except those required for Schedule 2)

---

#### **5. Enforcement and Jurisdiction**

- **Enforcement of incorporated laws** is carried out under **BC law**, including:
  - Prosecution of offences
  - Review or appeal of decisions
  - Notice and service requirements

- **Provincial officials and bodies** (as specified in Schedule 2) have the authority to enforce the incorporated laws.
- A **written agreement** between the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, the **Province of British Columbia**, and the **Haisla Nation Council** governs the administration and enforcement of the regulations.

---

#### **6. Key Provisions and Adaptations**

##### **A. Occupancy and Construction Standards**
- All construction and alterations must comply with:
  - **British Columbia Building Code**
  - **British Columbia Fire Code**
- No building may be occupied **without an occupancy permit** issued by the Haisla Nation or an authorized representative.
- An occupancy permit must be issued **within 15 days** of receiving written confirmation from a **licensed professional engineer** that the building was constructed in accordance with section 10 (presumably a construction standard or design requirement).

##### **B. Pre-existing Permits**
- Any permits, authorizations, orders, or exemptions issued by the **British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC)** **prior to the coming into force** of these regulations are deemed to have been issued **under these regulations** and are valid.

##### **C. Specific Exclusions**
- The **Indian Reserve Waste Disposal Regulations** do **not apply** to the project lands.
- The **project lands are not considered municipal land**, so:
  - The **Weed Control Act and Regulation** do not apply (project lands are not treated as land in a municipality).
  - The **Wildfire Act** applies only insofar as it relates to the **Wildfire Act**, not broadly.
  - The **project lands are treated as private lands** for purposes of the **Integrated Pest Management Regulation** and **Wildfire Act**.

##### **D. Liability and Responsibility Exclusions**
- **Her Majesty in Right of Canada** and **federal ministers/officials** are **not liable** under certain acts:
  - Under the **Environmental Management Act**, **Contaminated Sites Regulation**, and **Public Health Act**, federal entities are **not responsible persons** if a permit or approval under the **Indian Act** or **First Nations Land Management Act** authorizes soil removal or deposit.
  - In **section 99(1)(d)** of the Public Health Act, the failure to report is not a liability for federal or Haisla Nation entities.
- The **director’s power** to require financial security under section 48(4) of the Contaminated Sites Regulation **does not extend to Her Majesty in Right of Canada**.

##### **E. Definitions and Interpretations**
- **Occupier** in the **Occupiers Liability Act** is **excluded** from the Haisla Nation — meaning the Nation is not liable for occupier’s duties.
- In the **Oil and Gas Activities Act**, the project lands are treated as **unoccupied Crown land**.
- The **definition of "specified enactment"** excludes the **Land Act, Forest Act, and Heritage Conservation Act**.
- In **section 34(2)(a)(i)**, "Land Act" is read as referring to the **Indian Act (Canada)**.
- The **commissioner’s power** under section 53(3) **does not include** the power to make orders against Her Majesty in Right of Canada.

##### **F. Environmental and Regulatory Framework**
- The **Environmental Management Act** and its regulations apply, but with specific exclusions:
  - Excludes powers related to **municipalities** or **municipal employees**.
  - For **remediation**, the standard is **consistent with industrial land use** (not residential or environmental standards).
- In **section 40(1)(b)**, "the applicable municipality" is read as **"the director"** (i.e., the environmental director).
- The **Environmental Protection and Management Regulation** applies only to:
  - Wildlife habitat areas and features **outside** the project lands
  - Resource features **outside** the project lands
  - Cultural heritage resources **outside** the project lands

##### **G. Financial and Administrative Provisions**
- If a law requires a **cash deposit or financial security**, this requirement **applies in addition to**, not instead of, any lease requirements for the project lands.
- The **Administrative Penalties Regulation** and **Environmental Protection and Management Regulation** exclude certain sections (e.g., section 36(1), section 19), meaning those penalties do not apply in full.
