### ✅ 4. **Monthly Payment of Allowances (Active – Non-Repealed)**

> **Summary**:  
> - Monthly instalments of an allowance must be paid on the **last day of the month**.

> - If a recipient **dies during the month**, the instalment for that month is prorated based on the number of days from the **first day of the month up to and including the date of death**.  
>  
> **Example**:  
> A member is entitled to an allowance on May 15. The monthly payment is due on May 31. The instalment for May is calculated as:  
> (15/31) × total monthly amount = prorated payment.  
>  
> **Implication**:  
> This ensures fair treatment when entitlement begins mid-month or ends mid-month.  
>

>  
> ✅ **Conclusion**: **Currently in effect**.

#### a) **First Instalment**  
- Due on the **last day of the month** in which the election is received by the Minister.

#### d) **Amendments to Payment Plans**  
A member may amend their payment plan at any time to:  
1. Pay the remaining balance as a **lump sum**;

3. Pay a lump sum plus monthly instalments (within a shorter or equal period);  
4. Decrease monthly instalments (smaller amounts) over a longer period — **provided the amendment is made during the member’s period of contribution**.
