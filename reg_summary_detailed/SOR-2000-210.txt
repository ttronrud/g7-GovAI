## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations**

### 📌 **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**
- These regulations were established under **section 44 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)**.
- They were **approved by the Governor in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Natural Resources**.
- The regulations were issued by the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)** on **May 31, 2000**, and came into force on the day of approval.
- The primary objective is to **prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons** by controlling the import, export, and transit of sensitive nuclear materials, equipment, and information.

### 📌 **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (NSCA). |
| **Controlled Nuclear Substance** | Includes specific nuclear materials listed in the schedule (e.g., fissionable materials, source materials, deuterium, tritium, etc.). |
| **Controlled Nuclear Equipment** | Equipment specifically designed or prepared for use in nuclear reactors, reprocessing, fuel fabrication, or isotope separation (e.g., centrifuges, reactor vessels, pumps). |
| **Controlled Nuclear Information** | Technical data, designs, or documentation related to controlled substances or equipment, unless publicly disclosed. |
| **Transit** | Movement of a substance, equipment, or information through Canada from a foreign point of origin to a foreign destination, with no final destination in Canada. |

> ⚠️ **Important Note**:  
> All controlled nuclear substances are considered **"nuclear substances"** under section 2(d) of the NSCA for import/export purposes.  
> All controlled nuclear equipment is considered **"prescribed equipment"** under the Act.  
> All controlled nuclear information is **"prescribed information"** unless it has been made public under the Act or a licence.

---

### 📌 **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations govern:
- The **import and export** of:
  - Controlled nuclear substances
  - Controlled nuclear equipment
  - Controlled nuclear information
- Applies to all transactions involving these items, whether for commercial, research, or industrial use.

---

### 📌 **4. Licence Requirements for Import/Export**

#### ✅ **Mandatory Licence Application Requirements**
Every application for a licence to import or export a controlled item must include:
1. Applicant’s name, address, and telephone number.
2. Detailed description of the substance/equipment/information (including quantity and schedule paragraph reference).
3. Name and address of supplier.
4. Country of origin.
5. Name, address, and (if importing) telephone number of each consignee.
6. Intended **end-use** and **end-use location** by the final consignee.
7. Number of any existing licence to possess the item (if applicable).
8. For **Category I, II, or III nuclear material** (as defined in the *Nuclear Security Regulations*), **measures to comply with INFCIRC/274/Rev.1** (Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material).

> 🔍 **Additional Information Requested**:  
> The CNSC or a designated officer may request **any further information** necessary to assess compliance with subsection 24(4) of the NSCA (i.e., to determine whether the activity poses a proliferation risk).

---

### 📌 **5. Exemptions from Licence Requirements**

Certain activities are **exempt** from requiring a licence under specific conditions. These exemptions apply **only to the specified activities** and do **not** relieve individuals or organizations from other licence obligations under section 26 of the NSCA.

| Exempt Activity | Conditions |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Import** of controlled nuclear substances listed in **Part B of the schedule** | No licence required. |
| **Import** of controlled nuclear equipment listed in **paragraph A.3 or Part B of the schedule** | No licence required. |
| **Import** of controlled nuclear information related to equipment/substances in A.3 or Part B | No licence required. |
| **Import** for **transit** purposes (through Canada) | No licence required. |
| **Export** after transit | No licence required. |
| **Import** of up to **200 kg per shipment** of a controlled substance in **paragraph A.1.3** (non-reactor use) | No licence required. |
| **Export** of a controlled substance in **paragraph A.1.4** (non-reactor use) to any **Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) Participating Government** | No licence required. |
| **Import** of a controlled substance in **paragraph A.1.4** (non-reactor use) | No licence required. |
| **Import** of a controlled substance in **paragraph A.1.5** (contained in self-luminous sources/devices) | No licence required. |
| **Export** of a self-luminous source/device containing **less than 1,480 GBq of tritium** to any NSG Participating Government | No licence required. |

> ⚠️ **Important Clarification**:  
> These exemptions **do not override** the requirement under **section 26** of the NSCA for other activities involving nuclear materials or equipment.

### 📌 **6. Reporting Obligations (for Exempt Exports)**

Every person who exports a controlled nuclear substance under **exempted activities (1)(f) or (i)** must submit a **written report by January 31** of each calendar year, including:

- Exporter’s name, address, and telephone number.
- Description of the substance (quantity, country of origin).
- Date of export.
- Name and address of each consignee.
- Intended **end-use** and **end-use location** as stated by the final consignee.

> 🔍 **Geographic Limitation for (1)(i)**:  
> This reporting requirement applies **only** to exports destined for **States that are signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**, specifically:
> - Signed at London/Washington (July 23, 1968) and Moscow (July 29, 1968)
> - Came into force for Canada on **March 5, 1970**
