**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
*Order Respecting Ex-Gratia Payments to Persons who were in Conjugal Relationships with now Deceased Chinese Head Tax Payers or to Designated Beneficiaries*

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Treasury Board.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This order establishes a framework for the payment of **ex-gratia (gratuitous) compensation of $20,000** to individuals who were in conjugal (spousal or domestic partner) relationships with Chinese head tax payers who have died, or to designated beneficiaries of such individuals. The payments are intended to provide financial support to those affected by the historical Chinese Head Tax policy in Canada, which required Chinese immigrants to pay a fee to enter the country in the early 20th century.

### Key Provisions and Interpretation:

#### 1. **Who Is Eligible for Payment?**

The Minister (Minister of Canadian Heritage) may authorize a payment of **$20,000** to a person who meets **all of the following conditions**:

- **Conjugal Relationship Requirement:**  
  The applicant must establish that they were in a conjugal relationship with a person who:
  - Died and, at the time of death, met the criteria set out in **paragraphs 2(a) and (b)** of the *Order Respecting Ex-Gratia Payments to Chinese Head Tax Payers* (SI/2006-109).
    - These criteria typically include: being a Chinese head tax payer who entered Canada between 1885 and 1923 and who paid the head tax (or who was otherwise subject to it).

- **Connection to Canada Requirement:**  
  The applicant must either:
  - Be a **Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada**, or  
  - In the **opinion of the Minister**, have a **long-standing connection to Canada** (e.g., lived in Canada for a significant period, has Canadian ties, or has strong familial or community links).

- **Date of Survival Requirement:**  
  The applicant must have been **alive on February 6, 2006**.

> This ensures that only individuals who were alive during a key reference point (February 6, 2006) are eligible, which helps determine eligibility under the historical context of the head tax policy.

#### 2. **Beneficiary Payments (for those who died after February 6, 2006)**

The Minister may also make a $20,000 ex-gratia payment to a **designated beneficiary** in the following circumstances:

- The original applicant under the *Order Respecting Ex-Gratia Payments to Chinese Head Tax Payers* (SI/2006-109) was a person who:
  - Met the head tax criteria (paragraphs 2(a) and (b)),
  - Died **after February 6, 2006**,
- And **no prior payment** was made as a result of that original application,
- And **no other person** has made an application under that original order for the same beneficiary.

> This provision ensures that beneficiaries of deceased head tax payers who died after the reference date (Feb 6, 2006) are not left without compensation if no earlier claim was filed.

Additionally, the Minister may make a payment to a beneficiary identified in an application under subsection 3(1) (i.e., a conjugal relationship claim) if the person referred to in subsection (1) died after February 6, 2006.

#### 3. **Application Requirements and Deadlines**

- **Deadline for Applications:**  
  All applications must be submitted to the Minister **on or before March 31, 2008**.

- **Form and Documentation:**  
  Applications must:
  - Be in the form **approved by the Minister**, and  
  - Be supported by **evidence** that the applicant meets the eligibility criteria (e.g., proof of conjugal relationship, proof of residency, marriage certificate, birth certificate, or other documentation).

- **Late Applications (Exception):**  
  If an application is submitted **after March 31, 2008**, it may still be accepted **only if** the Minister is satisfied that the applicant was **unable to submit it earlier due to facts or circumstances beyond their control** (e.g., illness, death of a family member, lack of access to records, or other unforeseen events).

---

#### 4. **Nature of the Payment**

- Each payment is a **one-time lump sum of $20,000**.
- The payment is **not a legal admission of liability** by the Crown.
- It is **not a refund or compensation for damages** but rather a **symbolic gesture of recognition and redress** for historical injustice related to the Chinese head tax.

---

#### 5. **Legal and Policy Context**

- This regulation is part of a broader effort by the Canadian government to **acknowledge and address the historical injustices** faced by Chinese immigrants who were subjected to the head tax (1885–1923), which was used as a discriminatory barrier to entry.
- The payments are **ex-gratia**, meaning they are made voluntarily and without legal obligation, and are not intended to constitute a formal settlement or liability.
- The regulation builds upon the earlier *Order Respecting Ex-Gratia Payments to Chinese Head Tax Payers* (SI/2006-109), which established the initial framework for compensation to surviving spouses and dependents.

### Conclusion:

This regulation represents a significant step in Canada’s efforts to **acknowledge and provide meaningful redress** to descendants and spouses of Chinese immigrants who paid the head tax. By offering a one-time, non-liability-based payment of $20,000 to eligible individuals, the government demonstrates a commitment to **historical justice, reconciliation, and equity**. The strict eligibility criteria ensure that only those with genuine historical and personal connections to the head tax system are compensated, while the application process emphasizes transparency, documentation, and fairness.

It remains a **symbolic but important gesture** in Canada’s broader reconciliation journey with Indigenous and immigrant communities, particularly those who faced systemic discrimination in the past.
