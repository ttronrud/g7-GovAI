**Detailed Summary of the Firearms Fees Remission Order (Registration Certificate)**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and the Treasury Board. It is grounded in **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which authorizes the government to make fee remission orders in the public interest. This provision allows for the temporary waiver or remission of fees when it is deemed beneficial to the public or administrative objectives.

**Regulatory Text and Key Provisions:**

1. **Scope of the Remission:**
   - The remission applies specifically to the **fee for a registration certificate** under the *Firearms Fees Regulations*.
   - The remission is granted to **individual applicants** who pay the required fee *before* receiving a personalized application form from the Registrar of Firearms.

2. **Definition of "Personalized Application Form":**
   - A "personalized application form" is defined as an application form that includes:
     - The applicant’s full name,
     - A specified return date (i.e., the date by which the form must be returned),
     - A unique bar code (used for tracking and processing purposes).

3. **Conditions for Remission:**
   - The fee remission is **only available** to individuals who:
     - Pay the registration certificate fee **before** receiving a personalized application form in the mail.
   - The remission is **time-limited** and applies only during a specific period:
     - **From October 1, 1998, to June 30, 2002**, inclusive.

4. **Purpose and Public Interest Rationale:**
   - The regulation is intended to **reduce administrative burdens** on applicants during a transitional period when the system was transitioning from a standard form process to a personalized, bar-coded form system.
   - By allowing individuals to pay the fee upfront before receiving the personalized form, the government aimed to:
     - Minimize delays in processing,
     - Improve the efficiency of the registration process,
     - Prevent potential backlogs due to applicants waiting for forms before making payments.

**Key Implications:**

- **No Remission Beyond the Period:** The remission does not apply to applicants who pay the fee after June 30, 2002, or who receive the personalized form before paying the fee.
- **Applicability to Individuals Only:** The regulation does not extend to organizations, businesses, or other entities; it is specifically for individual applicants.
- **Fee Remission is Not a Full Waiver:** The remission is a reduction or exemption of the fee in specific circumstances, not a complete elimination. The fee is still required to be paid, but the payment is recognized as valid and non-penalty if made before receiving the personalized form within the specified timeframe.

**Historical Context:**
This regulation was introduced during a period of modernization in the Canadian firearms registration system. The shift to personalized forms with bar codes was part of a broader effort to improve tracking, reduce fraud, and streamline administrative processes. The remission order provided a practical incentive for individuals to act promptly and avoid delays, while also ensuring that the transition was smooth and accessible.

**Legal Citation:**

  (This refers to the *Firearms Fees Regulations*, 1991, section 7(2), which provides the legal basis for the order.)

**Conclusion:**
This Firearms Fees Remission Order is a targeted, time-limited measure designed to support the efficient rollout of a new firearms registration system. It provides a clear, conditional exemption for individuals who pay the registration certificate fee before receiving a personalized application form during the period from October 1, 1998, to June 30, 2002. The regulation reflects a balance between administrative modernization and public service accessibility, ensuring that applicants are not disadvantaged during a system transition.
