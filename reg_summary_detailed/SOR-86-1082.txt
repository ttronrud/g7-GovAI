### **Detailed Summary of the Equal Wages Guidelines, 1986**  
*Issued by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC), November 18, 1986*  
*Replaces the original Equal Wages Guidelines made on September 18, 1978*

---

## **Overview**

The **Equal Wages Guidelines, 1986** were issued by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) under **subsection 11(3)** and **22(2)** of the *Canadian Human Rights Act* (CHRA). These guidelines formally **revoke** the outdated 1978 Equal Wages Guidelines and introduce a more comprehensive, equitable, and legally robust framework for assessing wage disparities between employees performing **work of equal value**, particularly in relation to **gender-based discrimination**.

The core objective of these guidelines is to ensure that **men and women are paid fairly** when performing work of equal value, while also recognizing **legitimate, non-discriminatory justifications** for wage differences. The guidelines are binding for the CHRC and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in the investigation and adjudication of complaints under **section 11 of the CHRA**, which prohibits sex-based wage discrimination.

These guidelines may be cited as:  
**"The Equal Wages Guidelines, 1986"**

## **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

### **1. Definition of "Work of Equal Value" (Section 3)**  
The guidelines define "work of equal value" as work that requires **similar levels of skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions**, regardless of the job title or traditional gender associations.

#### **Factors to Consider in Assessing Equal Value:**
| Factor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Skill** | Intellectual and physical qualifications acquired through experience, training, education, or natural ability. *Note:* The method of acquisition (e.g., formal education vs. on-the-job training) is **not** relevant. Only the resulting skill level matters. |
| **Effort** | Intellectual and physical effort required in performing the work. Effort can be compared directly between jobs. |
| **Responsibility** | The extent to which an employee is responsible for technical, financial, or human resources (e.g., managing a team, making budget decisions). |
| **Working Conditions** | Includes physical and psychological elements such as noise, temperature, isolation, physical danger, health hazards, and stress. These are considered when evaluating the value of work. |

> **Important Note:**  
> - **Overtime or shift work** is **not** considered a factor in assessing working conditions **if** the employee is paid **above the base wage** for such work.  
> - The focus is on **actual working conditions**, not on work hours alone.

---

### **2. Use of Internal Wage Systems (Section 5)**  
If an employer uses a **system** (e.g., job evaluation, classification, or pay scale) to determine wages:

- The system **must be used** in investigating wage discrimination complaints, **provided it meets three criteria**:
  1. **No sexual bias** – the system must not favor one gender over another.
  2. **Capable of measuring relative value** – it must be able to compare all jobs within the establishment.
  3. **Assesses skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions** – in accordance with sections 3–8 above.

> This provision promotes **transparency and consistency** in wage determination and helps prevent arbitrary or gender-based disparities.

---

### **3. Definition of "Employees of an Establishment" (Section 6)**  
Employees are considered part of the same establishment **if they are subject to a common personnel and wage policy**, regardless of:
- Whether the policy is administered centrally,
- Whether there are collective agreements,
- Whether employees are in different departments or locations.

> This broadens the scope of the guidelines to cover **all employees under a single employer’s wage structure**, even if they are not in the same department.

---

### **4. Complaints by Occupational Groups (Section 7)**  
When a complaint is filed by or on behalf of an **identifiable occupational group** (e.g., female clerks, male mechanics), the **composition of the group by sex** is a key factor in determining whether the practice is discriminatory.

#### **What Constitutes a "Predominantly One-Sex" Group?**  
A group is considered predominantly of one sex based on the **number of members of that sex** in the group, as of the year immediately before the complaint is filed:

| Group Size | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| Less than 100 members | At least **70%** of members must be of the same sex |
| 100 to 500 members | At least **60%** |
| More than 500 members | At least **55%** |

> This threshold ensures that only groups with a significant gender imbalance are treated as "predominantly one sex" and thus eligible for comparison with a group of the opposite sex.

#### **Comparative Procedures:**
- If a complaint is filed by a group (e.g., female employees), and the group is predominantly female, the **comparison group** must be predominantly male (and vice versa).
- If a comparison is made between two groups (e.g., male vs. female clerks), those groups are **deemed one group** for the purpose of analysis.
- If a **direct comparison** of work value and wages is not possible, **indirect comparison** may be used.

#### **Wage Curve Method (Indirect Comparison):**  
- The **wage curve** of the other group (e.g., male employees) is used to determine whether the wages of the complainant group (e.g., female employees) are **disproportionately lower**.
- This method allows for fair comparison even when direct data is missing or difficult to obtain.

### **5. Justifications for Wage Differences (Section 16)**  
Section 11(3) of the CHRA allows for **legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons** to justify differences in wages between men and women performing work of equal value. The following are recognized justifications:

| Justification | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Different Performance Ratings** | If employees are subject to a formal performance appraisal system that has been communicated to them, differences in ratings can justify wage differences. |
| **Seniority** | Wages increase periodically based on length of service (e.g., a 10-year veteran earns more than a 2-year employee). This is acceptable if applied equally to both sexes. |
| **Re-evaluation and Downgrading** | If an employee’s position is downgraded (e.g., due to restructuring), their wages are temporarily fixed or reduced until they match the wages of the new position. This is acceptable if the new position is objectively less valuable. |
| **Rehabilitation Assignment** | During short-term recovery from injury or illness, an employee may receive higher wages than the value of their work. This is justified if it supports rehabilitation. |
| **Demotion Procedure** | An employee is reassigned to a lower-level position due to factors beyond their control (e.g., health issues, job complexity, internal labor surplus). Wages are not reduced. |
| **Gradual Wage Reduction** | A slow reduction in wages may occur for the same reasons as demotion (e.g., performance decline due to external factors). |
| **Temporary Training Position** | If a temporary training role is part of a **gender-neutral development program** leading to career advancement, temporary wage differences are acceptable. |
| **Internal Labour Shortage** | If there is a shortage of workers in a specific job classification, wages may be adjusted to attract talent. |
| **Reclassification to a Lower Level** | If an employee continues to receive the former higher-level wage after a reclassification, this may justify a wage difference. |
| **Regional Wage Rates** | Wages may vary by geographic location (e.g., Toronto vs. rural Saskatchewan) for the same job. This is acceptable if applied consistently. |

> **Critical Requirement:**  
> For **any** of these justifications (especially those involving gender-based differences), the employer must **demonstrate that the factor is applied consistently and equitably** to **all male and female employees** performing work of equal value.

### **6. Additional Requirements for Specific Justifications**

| Justification | Additional Requirement |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Internal Labour Shortage (16(f))** | There must be **similar differences** between the affected group (e.g., female technicians) and **another group of the same sex** performing work of equal value. |
| **Reclassification to Lower Level (16(g))** | Two conditions must be met:<br>1. **No new employee** has been hired at the former higher-level wage.<br>2. There must be a **difference** between the incumbents receiving the old wage and another group of employees of the **same sex** performing work of equal value. |

> These requirements ensure that wage differences are not arbitrary or used to maintain gender-based inequities.

### **7. Role of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal and the Board**

- The CHRC and the **Canadian Human Rights Tribunal** have the **power to interpret and apply** the Equal Wages Guidelines, even **after the coming into force of section 399** of the CHRA (which generally removes the tribunal’s jurisdiction over employment issues).
- This ensures **continuity and enforceability** of the guidelines in wage discrimination cases.

> **Special Provision (Section 399 Exception):**  
> If section 399 is in force when
