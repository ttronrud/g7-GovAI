### **Key Definitions**

1. **Designated**  
   - Refers to foreign countries or military agencies that are officially designated under **paragraph 132(1)(g) of the Customs Tariff**.

2. **Goods**  
   - Specifically refers to items falling under **Tariff Item No. 9810.00.00**.  
   - The exact nature of these goods is not detailed in this regulation but is defined in the Customs Tariff. Typically, such items may include equipment, supplies, or materials used by military or government entities.

### **Import Requirements Based on Importer Type**

The regulation outlines two distinct import scenarios and the corresponding documentation required at the time of importation:

#### **1. Goods Imported by a Designated Foreign Country**

- The **importer** (a government entity of a designated foreign country) must provide to a customs officer:
  - A **certificate in the form set out in Schedule 1**.
  - The certificate must be:
    - Completed in **English or French** (official languages of Canada).
    - Signed by an **official authorized by the foreign government**.
    - Signed by an official from the **designated government department, agency, office, or military unit**.

- **Content of the Certificate (Schedule 1):**  
  Must include:
  - A statement confirming that the goods described in the certificate or invoice are being imported **by or on behalf of** a designated government body.
  - A declaration that the goods **remain the property of the government of the designated foreign country**.
  - A clear assertion that the goods are **not for resale, gift, or any other form of distribution**.
  - The **name and title** of the authorized official.
  - **Telephone and fax numbers** of the official.
  - **Signature and date** of the official.

> This ensures that the goods are being imported strictly for governmental use and not for commercial or private purposes.

#### **2. Goods Imported and Consigned to a Designated Military Service Agency or Institution in Canada**

- The importer must provide to a customs officer:
  - A **certificate in the form set out in Schedule 2**.
  - The certificate must be:
    - Completed in **English or French**.
    - Signed by an **official authorized by the designated military service agency or institution**.

- **Content of the Certificate (Schedule 2):**  
  Must include:
  - A statement confirming that the goods are being imported **on behalf of the designated foreign country** by a Canadian military agency or institution.
  - A declaration that the goods are for the **personal use or consumption** of **nationals of that foreign country** who are employed in **defence establishments in Canada**.
  - The **name and title** of the authorized official.
  - **Telephone and fax numbers** of the official.
  - **Signature and date** of the official.

> This ensures that the goods are being used solely by Canadian-based military personnel of the designated foreign country and not for commercial or general distribution.

---

### **Key Provisions and Implications**

- **No Resale or Distribution:**  
  Both certificates explicitly prohibit the resale, gifting, or any form of commercial distribution of the imported goods. This protects the integrity of the importation and ensures compliance with international and domestic trade regulations.

- **Governmental Use Only:**  
  The goods are intended for official government or military use — not for private individuals or commercial enterprises.

- **Official Authorization Required:**  
  Only authorized officials from the designated foreign government or Canadian military agency may issue the required certificates. This adds a layer of accountability and verification.

- **Language Requirement:**  
  All certificates must be in **English or French**, reflecting Canada’s bilingual policy and ensuring clarity in official documentation.

- **Formal Documentation at Importation:**  
  The certificates must be presented **at the time of importation** to customs officers. This ensures real-time verification and prevents fraudulent or unauthorized imports.

### **Regulatory Context**

This regulation operates within the broader framework of the **Customs Tariff**, particularly under:
- **Paragraph 133(c)**: Which allows for special import provisions for goods imported by designated foreign governments or military entities.
- **Paragraph 132(1)(g)**: Which defines the criteria for a foreign country or agency to be "designated" for such special treatment.

Such provisions are typically used to:
- Facilitate the importation of military equipment or supplies for defence cooperation.
- Support international defence agreements or joint operations.
- Avoid unnecessary tariffs or customs duties on essential government or military-use items.

### **Effective Date and Enforcement**

- **Effective Date:** January 1, 1998  
- The regulation is enforceable by Canadian customs authorities and applies to all importations of goods under Tariff Item 9810.00.00 that meet the defined criteria.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a clear, structured, and enforceable framework for the importation of specific goods by designated foreign governments or their military agencies into Canada. It emphasizes transparency, accountability, and the non-commercial nature of such imports through mandatory documentation and official authorization. By requiring detailed certificates, it helps prevent misuse, ensures compliance with trade laws, and supports Canada’s international defence and diplomatic relationships.

> **In essence:** This regulation allows for the import of certain goods (under Tariff Item 9810.00.00) by or for designated foreign governments and military institutions — **only if** proper, officially signed certificates are provided confirming that the goods are for government or personal military use and are not for resale or distribution.
