**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Mushroom Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

The *British Columbia Mushroom Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations*, made under the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act* (Act), establish a controlled marketing system for mushrooms grown in British Columbia (the "regulated product"). These regulations govern the **interprovincial and export trade** of BC-grown mushrooms, ensuring quality control, fair pricing, traceability, and compliance with market standards.

The primary objective is to **protect growers, maintain market integrity, ensure equitable distribution, and prevent unfair or unregulated trade practices** in the mushroom industry.

The regulations were issued by the **British Columbia Mushroom Marketing Board (Board)** on August 6, 1980, and are referenced as **SOR/78-444** (Canada Gazette, Part II, p. 2284). They apply exclusively to marketing activities involving mushrooms grown in BC and to persons and property located within the province.
