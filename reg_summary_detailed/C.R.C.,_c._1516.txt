The provided text consists entirely of **repeal notices** indicating that a specific regulation (or set of regulations) has been **repealed** by amendments to the *Statutory Rules of Canada* (SOR — Statutory Orders and Regulations).

### Summary:

There is **no active regulation** described in the text because:

- The entire list consists of **repeal entries**, not the actual content or provisions of a regulation.
- Each entry follows the format:  
  `[Repealed, SOR/XXXX-XX, s. X]`  
  which means a particular section (s. X) of a regulation published in the *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada* (SOR) in the year XXXX, number XX, has been **officially repealed**.
- The repeated references to **SOR/2014-68, s. 94** indicate that **Section 94 of the regulation published on January 23, 2014 (SOR/2014-68)** was repealed — and this occurred **multiple times** in the list (repeated 36 times).
- Other repeals include:
  - **SOR/2007-273, s. 2** and **s. 29**
  - **SOR/88-9, s. 25**
  - **SOR/97-117, s. 4**

### Key Observations:

1. **The regulation itself is not present** — only the *repeal notices* are listed.
2. The **repeal of multiple sections** suggests that the original regulation (likely a federal regulation under a specific statute) was significantly amended or replaced.
3. The **repeal date** is tied to **SOR/2014-68**, which was issued on **January 23, 2014**, and the repeal of Section 94 appears to be a central part of that amendment.
4. The **repeal of multiple sections** implies that the regulation was either:
   - Obsolete,
   - Inconsistent with new legislation,
   - Superseded by a newer regulation,
   - Or deemed unnecessary or redundant.

### Conclusion:

➡️ **This list does not contain a detailed summary of an active regulation.**  
Instead, it is a **record of repeals** — meaning that **the regulation referenced (likely a prior version of a federal rule) has been formally removed from law**.  

The regulation has been **fully or partially repealed**, with **Section 94** being the most frequently cited section, and other sections (e.g., s. 2, s. 25, s. 4) also repealed under various SORs.

### Final Statement:

> **There is no active regulation to summarize. The provided text is a list of repeals indicating that the referenced regulation has been officially removed from force, primarily through SOR/2014-68, s. 94, and other amendments. As such, the regulation no longer exists in current legal form.**

If you have the **original regulation** or the **statute** it was under (e.g., *Fisheries Act*, *Canada Shipping Act*, etc.), I can provide a more detailed contextual summary of what the regulation might have addressed before its repeal.
