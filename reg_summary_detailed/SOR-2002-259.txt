The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2009-230, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or withdrawn) by **SOR/2009-230, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  This means the regulation no longer exists or is in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework by the amendment contained in **Supplemental Regulation 2009-230**, specifically under **section 1** of that regulation.

- **SOR/2009-230**:  
  This stands for *Statutory Instrument of 2009, No. 230*. It is a government document issued under the authority of a statute, typically used to amend or repeal existing rules or regulations. In this case, it was used to repeal certain outdated or obsolete provisions.

- **Section 1 of SOR/2009-230**:  
  Section 1 of this instrument explicitly **repeals** the previously cited regulation. While the original regulation is not named in your query, the repetition of "[Repealed, SOR/2009-230, s. 1]" suggests that multiple provisions or sections were targeted for repeal. The fact that it is listed four times may indicate a typographical or formatting error, or it could reflect that the repeal applies to multiple related or identical sections.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed when they:
  - Are obsolete or no longer relevant,
  - Have been superseded by newer legislation,
  - Create confusion or inconsistency with current laws,
  - Are redundant or overly complex.

- **Legal Effect**:  
  Once a regulation is repealed, it is no longer enforceable. Any actions or obligations previously based on it are no longer valid. Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to the current, active version of the regulation or statute.

- **Where to Find the Original Regulation**:  
  The original regulation that was repealed would have been published in the *Canada Gazette* or another official government publication prior to 2009. However, since it has been formally repealed, it is no longer part of the current legal framework.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in your query is **not currently in force**. It was **officially repealed** by **Section 1 of SOR/2009-230**, which was enacted to modernize or streamline the regulatory framework. As such, it should not be cited or applied in any legal, administrative, or operational context. For current regulatory requirements, one must consult the **current version of the applicable statute or regulation**, which may have been updated or replaced by subsequent amendments.
