**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, constitutes a formal transfer of specific powers, duties, and functions within the Canadian public service. It is enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to Section 2 of the aforementioned Act, which empowers the federal government to reassign responsibilities among different departments and ministers.

### Key Elements of the Transfer:

1. **Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions:**
   - The powers, duties, and functions related to **international expositions** are being transferred from the **Secretary of State for External Affairs** to the **Minister of Communications**.
   - These functions specifically pertain to the **International Expositions Program**, which involves the planning, coordination, and management of Canada’s participation in international expositions (such as World’s Fairs or World Expos), including the selection of host cities, financial planning, promotion, and representation of Canada on the global stage.

2. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**
   - The **control and supervision** of the **International Expositions Division** within the Department of External Affairs is also being transferred.
   - This division, previously under the oversight of the Secretary of State for External Affairs, will now come under the direct authority of the Minister of Communications.
   - This includes administrative oversight, staffing, budgeting, policy development, and operational management of the division.

### Context and Implications:

- **Administrative Realignment:** This transfer reflects a broader government effort to streamline and reallocate public service responsibilities to better align with current policy priorities and ministerial mandates. The move from External Affairs to Communications suggests that Canada's international exposition activities are now being integrated into a broader strategy focused on telecommunications, media, and global outreach—areas under the purview of the Minister of Communications.

- **Policy Continuity:** Despite the change in administrative ownership, the core functions—such as organizing and promoting international expositions—remain unchanged. The transfer ensures continuity in program delivery while placing the program under a ministerial office that may have stronger coordination with national communication strategies, media engagement, and cultural diplomacy efforts.

- **Public Service Efficiency:** By transferring the International Expositions Division to the Minister of Communications, the government aims to improve interdepartmental coordination, reduce duplication, and ensure that exposition-related activities are aligned with Canada’s broader communication and cultural promotion goals.

### Legal Authority:
The transfer is authorized under **Section 2 of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which allows for the reassignment of duties and functions between departments and ministers, provided such actions are recommended by the Prime Minister and approved by the Governor General in Council. This ensures that the transfer is both legally sound and politically justified.

### Conclusion:
This regulation formally shifts responsibility for Canada’s international exposition activities—from the Department of External Affairs to the Department of Communications. It includes both the functional responsibilities (such as program management and policy development) and the administrative control (including supervision of the International Expositions Division). The move underscores a strategic realignment of federal public service functions to enhance coherence, efficiency, and alignment with national communication and international engagement objectives.
