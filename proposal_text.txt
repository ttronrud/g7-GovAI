Application for Federal Workplace Safety Approval  
Northern Prairie Gas Compression Ltd. – Compressor Station CS-14

1. Employer and Operational Overview

Northern Prairie Gas Compression Ltd. (“NPGC”) is a federally regulated pipeline-support operator providing gas compression, metering, and monitoring services for a major transmission pipeline corridor in northern Alberta. NPGC is applying for workplace approval for its new Compressor Station CS-14, located at Milepost 212 of the Prairie Ridge Transmission Line.

The station will operate 24 hours per day with rotating 12-hour shifts. Typical staffing includes:
- 6 field operators per shift
- 1 control room technician
- 1 maintenance technician (day shift)
- Contractors as required for mechanical repairs, vegetation management, and site services

Peak occupancy is expected to be **10–12 personnel** at any given time.

2. Facility Description

Compressor Station CS-14 includes the following major components:
- Two 8,000-hp centrifugal gas compressors located in a steel-frame compressor building
- A control room and monitoring wing attached to the compressor building
- A maintenance workshop and small parts storage area
- Fuel-gas skids, scrubbers, and associated piping
- An electrical substation operated by a third-party utility
- Site perimeter fencing and motorized gate access
- One outdoor 5,000-L diesel storage tank for emergency generators
- Two portable buildings (trailers) used for:
  - Break/lunch area and lockers
  - Supervisor office and meeting room

The compressor building contains one main exterior door and one emergency exit door on the west side. The control room wing connects internally but does not have its own external exit door.

3. Health and Safety Governance

Health & Safety oversight at CS-14 will be managed by:
- The Station Supervisor (day shift)
- The Regional H&S Coordinator (based in Edmonton, 5 hours away)

A workplace health and safety committee will be formed when staffing reaches 20 regularly scheduled employees. Until that time, the Supervisor will handle H&S reviews and incident follow-up. Monthly safety meetings will be conducted by the Supervisor as operational demands permit.

4. Emergency Preparedness

The station has a general Emergency Response Manual (ERM) issued for the entire Prairie Ridge Transmission Line. NPGC plans to:
- Keep one printed ERM copy in the control room
- Provide new operators with a 10-minute overview of emergency shutdown (ESD) systems
- Notify workers that evacuation assembly point is "near the sign by the access road"

A site-specific written evacuation plan for CS-14 has not yet been prepared. The station does not currently conduct full evacuation drills due to compressor runtime constraints; however, operators are expected to exit through the main north door if an alarm is activated.

Provisions for workers with mobility restrictions will be considered “if such cases arise,” but no written assisted-evacuation procedure exists at this time.

5. Fire Protection and Explosion Safety

The compressor building includes:
- Fixed fire detection sensors connected to the pipeline control network
- Portable 10-lb ABC extinguishers at each building exit
- Firewater is not available on-site; NPGC relies on the nearest municipal responders (37 km away)

Combustible gas detectors are mounted at compressor skids, but no station-wide combustible gas alarm panel is installed in the control room. Operators visually monitor gas detector readouts during normal rounds.

The diesel tank includes a spill containment pad, but spill kits are stored inside the maintenance workshop, approximately 80 metres from the tank.

Hot-work procedures are being drafted, but a formal permit system has not been finalized.

6. First Aid and Medical Response

The station will maintain:
- One Level 1 first-aid kit in the control room
- One general-purpose kit in the maintenance shop
- A stretcher stored on the wall in the compressor building

No dedicated first-aid attendants are planned. Instead, workers are instructed to call 9-1-1 or the pipeline’s emergency line. The nearest ambulance station is 52 km away in North Ridge, Alberta. NPGC believes the low occupancy and moderate risk level do not justify on-site first-aid-trained personnel.

Incident logbooks will be maintained in the Supervisor’s office. Minor injuries will be documented if the worker chooses to report them.

7. Hazardous Substances (WHMIS)

Hazardous materials expected at CS-14:
- Compressor lubricants and gear oils
- Solvents and degreasers in the maintenance workshop
- Diesel fuel (5,000 L tank)
- Methane gas and condensate within process equipment
- Small quantities of paints and adhesives

Current WHMIS practices:
- SDS are stored electronically on the corporate intranet. No hard copies are kept on-site.
- Some lubricants are transferred into unlabelled plastic jugs for field use.
- Contractors bring their own chemicals and are responsible for their own SDS.
- New workers receive a “brief mention” of WHMIS during onboarding but no formal training module.

No designated flammable-storage cabinet is currently available in the workshop; excess oils and solvents are stored on open shelving.

8. Ergonomics, Noise, and Work Environment

The compressor building routinely exceeds 90 dBA during operation. Operators are expected to wear earplugs, which are available in wall dispensers. No formal noise monitoring program or audiometric testing plan is currently in place.

Lighting in the control room and shop meets general industrial requirements. Outdoor yard lighting is scheduled for future installation pending contractor availability.

Winter conditions create ice buildup around the main north exit; this will be monitored and salted “as needed.”

9. Sanitation and Welfare Facilities

The station includes:
- One indoor washroom in the control-room wing
- One washroom in the maintenance trailer (water supplied by a cistern that is filled bi-weekly)
- One compact kitchenette (microwave, hot plate, fridge)
- No showers

Potable water is provided through delivered water tanks and bottled water. No formal testing schedule exists for cistern water quality.

10. Training and Competency

New operators undergo:
- A 1-hour induction covering radio use, PPE basics, and emergency shutdown buttons
- A facility walk-through with a senior operator
- Optional online course modules

There is no recurring annual safety training plan. There is also no formal verification of operator competency in emergency shutdown or gas detection interpretation.

11. Inspections and Preventive Safety Measures

Routine inspections conducted by operators include:
- Daily equipment rounds
- Visual checks for leaks, unusual vibrations, and alarm indicators

No documented monthly workplace inspections or formal hazard assessments are currently implemented. Equipment issues are logged informally on whiteboards.

A hazard-prevention program is under development and will be rolled out “once resources become available.”

12. Declaration

NPGC believes that Compressor Station CS-14 provides a safe and practical working environment for its staff and will continue to improve safety practices as the site matures.
